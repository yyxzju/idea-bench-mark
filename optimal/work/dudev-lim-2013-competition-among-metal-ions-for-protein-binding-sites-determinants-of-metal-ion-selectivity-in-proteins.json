                "text": "Metal cations are indispensable components of the cellular machinery and are involved in numerous essential tasks ranging from nucleic acid and protein structure stabilization to enzyme catalysis, signal transduction, muscle contraction, hormone secretion, taste and pain sensation, respiration, and photosynthesis. [1] [2] [3] [4] They are the simplest, but most versatile, cofactors in protein biochemistry with a plethora of distinctive properties such as electron-acceptor ability, positive charge, flexible coordination sphere, specific ligand affinity, varying valence state, low-or high-spin configuration, and mobility/diffusivity. Over the course of 2-3 billion years of evolution, about two dozen (biogenic) metal species have been selected on the basis of their specific physicochemical properties and bioavailability. 5 Among these biogenic metal cations, Na + , K + , Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , Zn 2+ , Mn 2+ , Fe 2+/3+ , Co 2+/3+ , Ni 2+ , and Cu +/2+ are frequently found to participate in biochemical/biophysical processes. 1, 3, 4 Intracellular and extracellular fluids contain a mixture of metal cations present in different concentrations. For example, the average concentrations of free Na + , K + , Mg 2+ , and Ca 2+ in the blood plasma are \u223c145, \u223c4, \u223c1.5, and \u223c1.8 mM, respectively, while those in the cytosol are \u223c12, \u223c139, \u223c0.8, and <0.2 \u00d7 10 -3 mM, respectively. 6 At the same time, the intracellular concentration of the free transition metals such as Zn 2+ (10 -10 -10 -15 M) [7] [8] [9] and Cu + (\u223c10 -18 M) 10 is kept very low, yet the cellular/extracellular proteins in a healthy organism select with high fidelity the \"right\" metal ion against a background of, sometimes, higher concentrations of competing cations. This raises the following intriguing questions:",

Herein, we endeavor to address the above questions by summarizing recent findings in the field of metal ion competition/selectivity in biological systems. Before summarizing these findings, we first discuss the properties of the metal and ligands that determine the structure and properties of isolated metal complexes and the effects of the second-shell ligands and the protein matrix on the metal-ligand interactions. We also discuss the general relationship between the strength of the metal-ligand interactions and the magnitude of the metal ion concentrations in biological compartments, but not the mechanisms of metal homeostasis since this topic has already been covered in several reviews. 9, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Then we summarize findings on the competition between metal cations of the same charge (e.g., Na + vs K + ) and metal ions of different charges in various types of proteins. For each system, we will present the background and question and outline the approach, relying on the original references to provide details on the experimental/computational methodology. We will then attempt to answer the questions posed, highlighting the physical basis and/or the implications of the key findings.",

Relative to those of Ag + and Cd 2+ , relativistic stabilization of the 5d and 6s orbitals of Au + and Hg 2+ enhances the charge-accepting ability (see below) and thus the affinities of Au + and Hg 2+ for a given ligand. 21 For example, the computed free energies for water binding to Au + (-30.4 kcal/mol) and Hg 2+ (-85.2 kcal/mol) are more favorable than those to Ag + (-24.0 kcal/mol) and Cd 2+ (-74.1 kcal/mol). 20 (3) Charge-accepting ability. Between two cations with the same formal charge and similar R ion values, the metal ion that is a better electron acceptor or Lewis acid binds more favorably to the same ligand. For example, although Mg 2+ and Zn 2+ have the same charge and similar ionic radii (differing by only 0.02 \u00c5), Zn 2+ can accept more charge from a given ligand than Mg 2+ , 22 and the charge-transfer energy component for a Zn complex is more favorable than that for the corresponding Mg complex with the same set of ligands. 23 Hence, Zn complexes are more stable than their Mg counterparts.",

Polar uncharged aa ligands such as Asn/Gln and His side chains as well as peptide backbone groups have more favorable metal-binding energies than those with smaller dipole moments and polarizabilities such as Ser/Thr side chains. 24 (3) Charge-donating/accepting ability. Polarizable atoms such as the thiolate S -and carboxylate O -transfer more charge to the metal upon binding than less polarizable atoms such as the hydroxyl oxygen or imidazole nitrogen; thus, the Cys -and Asp -/Glu -side chains exhibit higher affinity for a given metal than the Ser/Thr/Tyr or His side chain. 23 Charge-donor ligands generally yield small metal d-orbital splitting, favoring high-spin complexes with open-shell transition metals, whereas ligands that accept back-donated electrons from the metal, e.g., carbon monoxide, give rise to large d-orbital splittings and favor low-spin complexes. 25 (4) Number of metal-bound atoms in a ligand. Increasing the number of atoms in a single ligand that can bind to a metal cofactor (termed denticity) in a buried cavity enhances the metal's affinity for the ligand. An example of a polydentate ligand is the rare \u03b3-carboxyglutamic acid, Gla, which has a side chain like Glu except that a second carboxylate (COO -) replaces a hydrogen of the second methylene group in Glu; i.e., the Gla side chain is -CH 2 CH(COO -) 2 . In a buried cavity, Ca 2+ binding is more favorable if it interacts with both carboxylate groups of a single Gla monodentately (via one of the carboxylate oxygen atoms) in a chelation bidentate mode rather than with a pair of Glu residues monodentately. 26 Thus, replacing two Glu residues with a single Gla increases the affinity for Ca 2+ in a buried cavity.",

Compared to a metal with a small ionic radius, a larger metal forms longer and weaker metal-ligand bonds, reducing the Pauli repulsion among the first-shell ligands, allowing more ligands to be bound to compensate for the weaker metal-ligand interactions. For a given metal type, the metal CN depends on the ligand's charge and charge-donating ability more than its size or denticity. Uncharged polar ligands donate less electron density to a given metal and repel one another less than the same number of negatively charged ligands, allowing the metal cation to coordinate more uncharged ligands than anionic ligands. While the metal's size and ligand's charge and charge-donating ability affect the metal CN, the protein environment seems to have relatively little effect: The most common metal CNs found in small complexes are similar to those in metalloproteins (Table 1 ).",

This special relationship between the binding strength and cellular abundance of biogenic dications may have been established billions of years ago in the early stages of cell evolution: The chemistry of the first cells utilized mainly Mg 2+ and Fe 2+ because of their bioavailability in the primordial ocean, and the cells adjusted their life cycle in accordance with the specific physicochemical properties of these metal ions. 5 Later, other transition metals (cobalt, nickel, copper, and zinc) became bioavailable 61 and added new features to the biochemistry of metalloproteins.

The above findings help to elucidate the mechanism of metal selectivity in the vertebrate voltage-gated sodium (Na v ) channel, which is composed of four nonidentical domains, labeled I-IV. Although its metal-bound 3D structure has not yet been solved, the key residues lining the selectivity filter have been identified as Asp (D), Glu (E), Lys (K), and Ala (A) from domains I, II, III, and IV, respectively. These four highly conserved residues forming the so-called DEKA motif/locus are responsible for the channel's ion selectivity, 76, [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] especially Lys: mutation of this Lys to another aa residue, even to a positively charged Arg, drastically reduces (or even reverses) the channel's selectivity for Na + . 76, [115] [116] [117] In accordance with points 1-3 in section 4.2, the DEKA filter is selective for Na + over K + because it provides three rather than four metalcoordinating ligands (Figure 2 ), two of which (Asp and Glu) have strong charge-donating carboxylate groups. Lys does not directly coordinate the metal cation; instead, its side chain constricts and rigidifies the pore by forming a tight hydrogen bond network with neighboring Glu and Ala residues, so any deviation from the pore's optimal size and stiffness would decrease the selectivity for Na + over K + . 56 4.2.2. Bacterial Na v Channels with the EEEE Motif. Whereas Asp, Glu, Lys, and Ala residues from four different domains line an asymmetric selectivity filter (DEKA locus) in vertebrate Na v channels, 76, [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] four Glu residues from four identical subunits comprise a symmetrical selectivity filter (EEEE locus) in bacterial Na v channels. 75, 118 In line with mutagenesis studies, 75 the 2.7 \u00c5 X-ray structure of a bacterial Na v channel captured in a closed-pore, metal-free conformation reveals four Glu side chains lining a short, water-filled selectivity filter. 118 Without the Lys to constrict or rigidif y the pore, how does the symmetrical EEEE f ilter preferentially bind Na + to K + ? In accord with the original hypothesis of Payandeh et al., 118 molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that the ion inside the large EEEE selectivity filter is partially hydrated and coordinates directly to only one or two Glu side chains and indirectly to the other Glu carboxylates via its first-shell water molecules. [119] [120] [121] [122] They also show that the Na + /K + selectivity in the bacterial Na v channels can be attributed to the following two factors:",

The rigidity of the metal-binding site secures an optimal cavity size for Na + binding. The MD simulations show that the backbone structure of the GluR5 metal-binding site is one of the most rigid regions in the entire molecule. 124 In the second, less selective Na2 binding site of LeuT comprising only neutral ligands, the structural stiffness of the binding site imposed by the local hydrogen-bond network appears to be the major factor determining the Na + /K + selectivity. 123 Like the bacterial Na v channels, four Glu residues also comprise the selectivity filter of the high-voltage-activated Ca v channel and are key determinants of ion selectivity from mutagenesis studies. [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] However, the high-voltage-activated Ca v channels are highly selective for Ca 2+ over Na + by a ratio of \u223c1000:1, 71, 132 whereas the bacterial Na v channels are weakly selective for Na + over Ca 2+ by a ratio of \u223c15. 75 This prompts an intriguing question: Why do voltage-gated Ca 2+ and bacterial Na + channels with the same EEEE motif in their selectivity f ilters confer opposite metal selectivities? A plausible answer to this question has been obtained by mapping the experimentally observed metal hydration structure in these two types of channels to the computed free energy for replacing Ca 2+ with Na + in model EEEE selectivity filters with varying pore size and degree of hydration of the passing cation. 57, 133 Although voltage-gated Ca 2+ and bacterial Na + channels share the same EEEE motif in their selectivity filters, their experimentally observed pore sizes are different, resulting in different numbers of water molecules bound to Ca 2+ and Na + in the pore. In high-voltage-activated Ca v channels, studies on the permeation of large organic cations estimate a pore aperture area of 18-19 \u00c5 2 , which fits Ca 2+ with a single water molecule. 134 As shown in Figure 3a ,b, a pore fitting a dehydrated or monohydrated cation is highly selective for Ca 2+ over Na + (large positive \u0394G x ; x = 4-30), as Ca 2+ provides more positive charge than Na + in the same volume to balance the negative charge of the carboxylate oxygens. [135] [136] [137] In bacterial Na v channels, the crystal structure of NavAb shows a wide, water-filled pore with an aperture area of \u223c21 \u00c5 2 that can accommodate a metal ion, retaining two water molecules in the plane of the EEEE ring. 118 As shown in Figure 3c ,d, a large solvent-accessible pore that binds indirectly to the metal cation via two or more water molecules confers moderate selectivity for Na + over Ca 2+ (negative \u0394G 30 ) due to the loss of one or more direct metal-carboxylate contacts and longer metal-O(carboxylate) distances, which disfavor Ca 2+ binding more than Na + binding. 133 5.1.1. Protein Matrix Controlling the Pore's Solvent Accessibility, Rigidity, and Size. The protein matrix can enhance or attenuate ion-protein interactions relative to ionsolvent interactions, thus dictating whether an EEEE selectivity filter preferentially binds Ca 2+ or Na + . The protein matrix can enhance ion-protein interactions relative to ion-solvent interactions in an EEEE selectivity filter by limiting solvent access, constricting the pore to fit only dehydrated or monohydrated Ca 2+ and favoring deprotonation of all four Glu ligands; in this case, ion-protein electrostatic interactions dictate ion selectivity, favoring dicationic Ca 2+ over monocationic Na + (see section 2.1). Conversely, the protein matrix can enhance ion-solvent interactions relative to ion-protein interactions in an EEEE selectivity filter by allowing water inside the pore, enlarging the pore to bind indirectly to the cation via two or more water molecules or protonating two or more Glu residues comprising the EEEE filter; in this case, solvation effects dictate ion selectivity, favoring Na + , which has a smaller dehydration penalty than Ca 2+ .",

Monocationic Cu + is highly reactive and, if left free in the body fluids, may cause oxidative damage. Therefore, the concentration of the free Cu + is subject to tight regulation by the cellular machinery and is kept at very low levels (in the attomolar, 10 -18 M, range 10 ). Copper-regulating proteins control Cu + homeostasis (uptake/efflux), while copper chaperones maintain Cu + transport inside the cell by tightly binding the cognate metal and delivering it to the target protein, thus avoiding cell damage or copper binding to adventitious binding sites. 16 These copper proteins are characterized by their high affinity for the native metal cation, which enables efficient discrimination between Cu + and other competing metal species from the surrounding fluids, in particular Zn 2+ (Table 3 ). Since monovalent cations have less favorable interactions with partner ligands than their divalent contenders (see section 2.1) and are expected to interact more weakly with the protein binding sites, how do the copperregulating and transport proteins preferentially bind the monocationic Cu + over the dicationic Zn 2+ (and other divalent biogenic metal species)? Experimental (metal titration of transcription assays, X-ray analysis, molecular spectroscopy measurements) 142, 143 and theoretical (quantum chemical and quantum mechanical (QM)/molecular mechanical (MM) calculations) 144 studies have addressed this question and disclosed the key determinants of the selectivity of Cu + over Zn 2+ in these systems:",

Cellular Metal Homeostasis. Under physiological conditions, however, the competition between Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ for the EF-hand binding site depends not only on the structure and properties of the EF-hand binding site, but also on the fluctuations in the cytosolic concentrations of the two competing cations. In the resting cell, the concentration of free Ca 2+ (\u223c10 -7 M) is 3-5 orders of magnitude lower than that of Mg 2+ (\u223c10 -3 M) and does not promote Ca 2+ binding; instead, Mg 2+ occupies (at least partially) the EF-hand binding sites. However, Mg 2+ , unlike Ca 2+ , is hexacoordinated with Glu-12 monodentately rather than bidentately bound (Figure 6b ), and Mg 2+ binding to EF-hand sites does not trigger the extensive conformational changes characteristic of the Ca 2+activated proteins; thus, no signaling response occurs. 11 Upon membrane depolarization or extracellular/intracellular messengers, the intracellular concentration of Ca 2+ increases to 10 -5 M. This, along with the intrinsic properties of the EF-hand binding site (see above), favors Ca 2+ binding to the protein over Mg 2+ . Unlike Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ is heptacoordinated with Glu-12 bidentately bound (Figure 6a ), and Ca 2+ binding to EF-hand sites is accompanied by large conformational changes, triggering a cascade of events along the signal transduction pathway. This shows how the EF-hand binding site and the different cytosolic metal concentrations can select a specific cation and turn a signal \"on\" (Ca 2+ bound) or \"off\" (Mg 2+ bound).",

GLA domains are an integral part of several extracellular proteins involved in the blood coagulation process such as factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, protein C, and protein S. These domains contain a constellation of Gla residues bound to 7-8 Ca 2+ ions and, in some sites, Mg 2+ ions, which stabilize the structure and maintain the proper protein conformation for subsequent membrane docking. The rare Gla residue is produced by posttranslational carboxylation of a specific Glu residue by a vitamin K-stimulated reaction. 152 Gla prefers to bind the metal ion in a chelation bidentate mode where both carboxylates are monodentately bound. 26 When only Mg 2+ ions are present in the GLA domain, an essential membrane-binding loop becomes disordered and fails to dock properly to the target membrane, thus disrupting the coagulation process. On the other hand, Ca 2+ ions can stabilize this loop and are absolutely required for blood to coagulate. Experimental studies have shown that Glacontaining proteins are tuned to preferentially bind Ca 2+ , [153] [154] [155] but why does Gla prefer to bind to Ca 2+ rather than Mg 2+ ? To address this question, the free energies of Gla binding to hexahydrated Mg 2+ and heptahydrated Ca 2+ in different dielectric media have been evaluated (see Figure 7 ). 26 Ring Strain, Partial Covalent Bonding, and Solvation Effects. Since Mg 2+ is a better charge acceptor than Ca 2+ , 35 the charge on Mg 2+ in the [Mg-(H 2 O) 4 -Gla] 0 complex is less than that on the respective Ca 2+ complex, indicating more charge transfer from Gla 2-to Mg 2+ than to Ca 2+ (by 0.28 e). Thus, Mg 2+ would be expected to bind more favorably to Gla 2- than Ca 2+ , yet the Gla side chain interacts more favorably with Ca 2+ than with Mg 2+ by \u223c3 kcal/mol in the gas phase and by \u223c9 kcal/mol in a buried protein cavity (Figure 7 ). This is because, upon metal binding, Gla forms a six-membered ring, which is less strained in the [Ca-(H 2 O) 5 -Gla] 0 complex (Figure 7b ) than in the corresponding [Mg-(H 2 O) 4 -Gla] 0 complex (Figure 7a ). 26 By splitting the metal's outer-shell density according to its ability to form a partly covalent bond involving charge transfer, Ca 2+ ions can form partially covalent charge transfer networks with the carboxylate oxygen lone pairs, whereas Mg 2+ cannot. 156 Furthermore, the Ca 2+ -Gla complex is better solvated than its Mg 2+ counterpart. Hence, ring strain, partial covalent bonding, and solvation of the metal complex are key determinants of the competition between Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ for Gla 2-.",

                "text": "6.1.3. Ribonuclease H. The enzyme ribonuclease H (RNase H), a member of the nucleotidyl-transferase superfamily, is a sequence-nonspecific, Mg 2+ (or Mn 2+ )-dependent endonuclease that specifically cleaves the RNA strand of DNA/ RNA hybrids. 157, 158 It has a DED\u2032 metal-binding motif comprising three conserved carboxylates. In Escherichia coli RNase HI, mutation of the third D\u2032 carboxylate (D70) to Asn inactivates the enzyme even when Mg 2+ is present. 159 This catalytically essential residue is bound indirectly via a bridging water molecule to Mg 2+ , whereas the first two carboxylates of the DED\u2032 metal-binding motif are bound directly to the native cofactor in the Mg 2+ -bound X-ray structure of E. coli RNase HI 160 (see Figure 8a ). Although Mg 2+ is expected to bind with greater affinity to the protein than the bulkier Ca 2+ (see above), in vitro experiments surprisingly show that Ca 2+ binds more tightly (by 2.2 kcal/mol) than Mg 2+ , but the Ca 2+ -bound enzyme is inactive. 161 Why does Ca 2+ bind more tightly than Mg 2+ to RNase H but inhibit enzyme activity, and how does the enzyme select Mg 2+ when it binds tighter to Ca 2+ ? To answer these questions, the free energies of alkaline-earth-metal dications (Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , Sr 2+ , Ba 2+ ) binding to E. coli RNase HI have been measured and computed using a thermodynamic integration approach. 162 Furthermore, free energy barriers for the binding of the catalytically essential D\u2032 to Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ in E. coli RNase H have been computed using free energy simulations with a classical force field. 163 The results show that Ca 2+ binds more tightly to the enzyme active site because it binds directly to the third D\u2032 carboxylate bidentately in addition to the Mg 2+ ligands (Figure 8b ). 162 The protein architecture and coupled protein-water interactions also favor Ca 2+ binding to all three acidic residues of the DED\u2032 metal-binding motif by lowering the free energy barrier for binding of the D\u2032 aspartate to Ca 2+ compared to that for binding of D\u2032 to the native Mg 2+ cofactor. 163 The metal-binding mode of D\u2032 also elucidates why Ca 2+ binding to E. coli RNase HI abolishes enzymatic activity: When the catalytically essential D\u2032 residue is bidentately bound to Ca 2+ , it cannot serve as a proton/hydrogen-bond acceptor during the catalytic reaction; furthermore, its coordination to Ca 2+ changes the net charge of the metal complex from 0 to -1, which in turn could affect Note that, even though RNase H could bind Ca 2+ tighter than Mg 2+ in vitro, it selects Mg 2+ over Ca 2+ in vivo, as the cellular concentration of Mg 2+ is much higher than that of Ca 2+ (by a factor of 10 3 -10 4 ).",

The computed free energies for replacing Mg 2+ with Zn 2+ in rigid and flexible metal-binding pockets show that all types of Mg 2+binding pockets are vulnerable to substitution by Zn 2+ . 22, 164 For example, the free energies for replacing Mg 2+ in model buried mono-, bi-, and trinuclear Mg 2+ -binding sites are all favorable (Figure 9 , negative \u0394G 4 ). Experimentally, Zn 2+ is found to displace the native Mg 2+ cofactor in certain proteins (e.g., CheY 165 ) and to inhibit enzymes such as alkaline phospha-tase, 166,167 tyrosine Csk kinase, 168 avian sarcoma virus integrase, 169 \u03b2-galactosidase, 170 and casein kinase-II. 171 Thus, it is primarily the cell machinery that selects Mg 2+ among other competing dications (e.g., Ca 2+ and Zn 2+ ) by maintaining a high concentration ratio of Mg 2+ to its biogenic competitor in various biological compartments, while keeping the cytosolic concentration of free Zn 2+ at \"safe\" picomolar to femtomolar levels. 7, 8 In principle, the protein could help to select Mg 2+ over Zn 2+ by creating a polynuclear site on its solvent-exposed surface. For example, replacing Mg 2+ in a solvent-exposed trinuclear binding site depicted in Figure 9c with Zn 2+ is unfavorable (positive \u0394G 80 ), as the central metal cation is bound to two \"superligands\", [(CH 3 COO)Mg(H 2 O) 3 (CH 3 COO) 2 ] -, which are poor charge donors compared to CH 3 COO -in the mononuclear complex. 164 However, solvent-exposed polynuclear Mg-binding sites, especially those with positive charge density, might be prone to substitution by monovalent ions such as Li + (see Figure 4 ).",

Transition-Metal Ion Selectivity in Proteins 6.4.1. Carbonic Anhydrase II. Carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) is a Zn 2+ metalloenzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydration/dehydration of CO 2 /H 2 CO 3 in the cytosol. The native Zn 2+ cofactor is tetrahedrally coordinated to three histidine side chains and a water molecule (Figure 11a ) and plays a catalytic role. Other divalent transition metals such as Mn 2+ , Co 2+ , Ni 2+ , Cu 2+ , and Cd 2+ can also bind to CAII, albeit with different affinities. Notably, Cu 2+ binds more tightly to the enzyme than the native Zn 2+ in vitro, but the Cu 2+ -substituted wild-type CAII is catalytically inactive. 181, 182 This raises the following intriguing question: In vivo, what factors control the selectivity for Zn 2+ over other competing divalent cations in this prototypical zinc enzyme, in particular Cu 2+ , which can inactivate CAII? This question has been elucidated largely by the measured binding affinities of various divalent transition-metal ions to wild-type CAII and to a series of CAII variants, where one of the His metal ligands has been mutated to Asp, Glu, Asn, Gln, and Cys. 182 The measured affinities allow evaluation of the effect of different factors influencing metal ion selectivity, which include (i) the properties of the metal ion, (ii) the polarizability of the metal ligating atom, (iii) the size of the binding site cavity, and (iv) the binding site geometry/architecture. They suggest the following thermodynamic determinants of Zn 2+ ion selectivity in CAII:",

Under conditions of oxidative stress, the cell machinery ensures favorable conditions for Mn 2+ binding by raising the cytosolic concentration of Mn 2+ relative to that of Fe 2+ . This is achieved in E. coli by activating the Mn 2+ importer MntH to pump in Mn 2+ and the ironsequestration protein Dps to reduce the cytosolic concentration of Fe 2+ . 188, 189 Aside from its role in oxidative damage protection, the Mn 2+ \u2192 Fe 2+ substitution has been implicated as a back-up strategy for cell survival during Fe 2+ deprivation. 64 Thus, compensating the insufficient Fe 2+ supply by Mn 2+ (or some other available dication) warrants uninterrupted cell metabolism when the \"native\" Fe 2+ is scarce. 64, 190 6.4.4. Periplasmic Mn and Cu Proteins in Cyanobacterium. Mn 2+ and Cu 2+ are at opposite ends of the Irving-Williams series: among the first-row transition-metal dications, Mn 2+ exhibits the lowest ligand affinity and Cu 2+ the highest. How can a manganese protein recognize and bind its cognate metal cofactor in the presence of the stronger binding copper? To answer this question, the metal binding and metal-induced protein folding of periplasmic manganese (MncA) and copper (CucA) proteins in cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803, which have identical cupin folds and metal-binding sites consisting of three His residues and one Glu residue, have been extensively studied experimentally. 191 Cellular Metal Ion Homeostasis. In vitro, both proteins preferentially bind Cu 2+ , but in vivo, the cell machinery enables each protein to select its native metal cofactor by proper compartmentalization of the protein folding events. The nascent MncA protein is secreted and folds in the cytoplasm, entrapping the more abundant Mn 2+ (\u223c10 -6 M) compared to the tight-binding copper (\u223c10 -18 M). Thus, the cytoplasmic environment (with a [Mn 2+ ]:[Cu +/2+ ] ratio of \u223c10 12 ) is much more favorable for Mn 2+ binding than the periplasmic medium, where the competing copper ions are present in higher concentrations (\u223c10 -12 M) 192 and the [Mn 2+ ]:[Cu +/2+ ] ratio is reduced to \u223c10 6 . Once folded, MncA is transported across the cell membrane via the Tat pathway to the periplasm, where Mn 2+ becomes kinetically trapped in MncA and is not exchanged for Cu 2+ . 191,193 CucA, on the other hand, is exported unfolded via the Sec pathway to the periplasm, where it folds and binds highly competitive Cu 2+ with little challenge by Mn 2+ and other metal ions. 191, 193 Thus, the location of the metalinduced protein folding and the relative metal ion concentrations, which are regulated by the cell machinery, appear to be the key determinants of Mn 2+ vs Cu 2+ selectivity in these proteins. 191, 193 7. DICATION-TRICATION COMPETITION 7.1. Ca 2+ vs Ln 3+ Selectivity in Proteins Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ have few chemical properties that can be used to explore their biochemistry in situ. Therefore, lanthanides (Ln 3+ ), nonbiogenic metal species, have been widely used in crystallographic and spectroscopic studies to probe Mg 2+ /Ca 2+binding sites in metalloproteins by replacing the native cofactor. Lanthanum (La 3+ ) appears to be an ideal biomimetic agent for Ca 2+ as it is also a \"hard\" Lewis acid and its ionic radius (1.03 \u00c5 for CN = 6 and 1.16 \u00c5 for CN = 8) is similar to that of Ca 2+ (1.00 and 1.12 \u00c5, respectively). 77 What types of Ca-binding sites in proteins are prone to Ln 3+ substitution? To shed light on this question, the free energies upon substituting Ca 2+ with La 3+ in model Ca-binding sites have been computed using density functional theory combined with continuum dielectric methods. 35 The metal exchange free energies show that the substitution of Ca 2+ with La 3+ is facilitated in binding cavities with (i) an increased number of metal-bound Asp/Glu residues (increased overall negative charge of the binding site), (ii) decreased solvent accessibility (low dielectric environment) and (iii) limited flexibility. Trivalent lanthanide cations have higher affinity toward oxygen-containing biological ligands (Asp/Glu, Asn/Gln/backbone peptide groups) than divalent Ca 2+ and, therefore, can successfully compete and substitute for Ca 2+ in protein binding sites. Although the rivalry between the native Ca 2+ and \"alien\" Ln 3+ does not have immediate implications for biological processes in vivo, the unique physicochemical properties of lanthanide cations make them very useful for probing Ca 2+ and other dication binding sites in vitro.

This selectivity strategy is exemplified by ion channel proteins whose selectivity filters can very efficiently discriminate the native ion from other metal cations, some of which exist in concentrations higher than that of the native one. Properties of the metal-binding site such as its relative rigidity and solvent accessibility, as well as the type, number, orientation, and protonation state of the metalcoordinating ligands, which determine the metal cavity size, geometry, and charge density, affect metal ion selectivity. The geometry/architecture of the binding site and the intrinsic properties of the metal cation appear to be key determinants of the competition between cations with the same net charge such as Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ (see section 6.1) or transition-metal dications (section 6.4). On the other hand, the overall charge of the binding cavity and the desolvation penalty of the metal cation appear to dictate the outcome of the contest between cations with different valence states: High negative charge density favors dications over monocations in calcium ion channels (section 5.1) and EF-hand domains (section 6.1.1), as well as trications over dications in Mg 2+ -binding (section 7.2) and Ca 2+ -binding (section 7.1) sites.",

The interaction energy of a given ligand binding to a metal ion generally becomes less favorable in going down a main group in the periodic table (see section 2.1). Nevertheless, potassium ion channels can select K + over Na + by a ratio of \u223c1000:1 by forcing the smaller Na + to adopt the larger CN of K + , thus preventing optimal Na + -ligand interactions 55 (see section 4.1). EF-hand domains can select Ca 2+ over the smaller Mg 2+ by creating well-structured, inflexible binding sites that do not fit the strong octahedral coordination preference of Mg 2+ (see section 6.1.1). This shows how the protein can choose the larger cation in the same group of the periodic table using \"negative\" design principles.",

This is partly due to the lower desolvation penalty of the monovalent ion relative to its divalent contender. In Mg 2+binding proteins, a high positive charge density in the metalbinding site makes the native Mg 2+ cofactor vulnerable to monovalent Li + substitution (section 5.2). In Cu + -binding proteins, favorable electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged copper cores, [Cu(Cys 2 )] -or [Cu-(Cys 2 His)] -, and positively charged aa residues from the second shell and the positive helix dipole near the binding site help to select monovalent Cu + over its divalent contender Zn 2+ (section 5.3).",

This is the case with most Mg 2+ -binding sites, which are not well protected against substitution from Zn 2+ (section 6.2.1) and sometimes Ca 2+ (section 6.1.3). In addition, some zinc, nickel, and manganese proteins are predisposed to Cu 2+ attack. In such circumstances, it is the cell machinery that controls the selectivity process: metalloregulatory proteins in the cell tightly control metal homeostasis in living organisms by keeping the concentrations of non-native, potentially damaging, metal species sufficiently low compared to those of the native, less competitive cofactor such as Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ . 68, 193, 199, 200 Although both experimental and theoretical studies have provided insight as to how proteins recognize their native metal cofactor, many questions regarding the process of metal selectivity in metalloproteins remain to be addressed. It is not clear how metalloregulatory proteins such as metallothionein take up or release metal ions as required. An in-depth understanding of the competition between essential biogenic metals and toxic heavy metals or nonbiogenic species with a potential therapeutic effect (e.g., Li + 141 ) in proteins is still lacking. The different factors controlling the kinetics of the metal exchange in protein binding sites are not well understood. Ionic strength effects on the processes of metal binding and selectivity have not been thoroughly investigated. Studies on the role of metal ions in causing or preventing/ curing neurodegenerative or psychiatric diseases are still in their infancy. Although our previous study 201 has identified the key determinants of anion selectivity in molybdate transport proteins that bind molybdate as MoO systems. Understanding the various mechanisms of proteinmetal recognition would not only deepen our knowledge about metalloprotein biochemistry, but also provide avenues for developing strategies for treating metal-related diseases, identifying novel drug targets, 47, 141 designing new drugs, and engineering metalloproteins with desired properties.",
