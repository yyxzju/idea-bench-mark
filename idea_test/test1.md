To explore the orchestration of inorganic and biochemical components and to develop bioinorganic catalysts and materials, we have described selected examples of artificial metalloproteins having multiple metallocofactors that were grouped depending on their initial protein scaffolds, the nature of introduced inorganic moieties, and the method used to propagate the number of metal ions within a protein. They demonstrated that diverse inorganic moieties can be selectively grafted and modulated in protein environments, providing a retrosynthetic bottom-up approach in the design of versatile and proficient biocatalysts and biomimetic model systems to explore fundamental questions in bioinorganic chemistry.\\t\\\\n Metalloproteins and metalloenzymes play important roles in biological systems by using the limited metal ions, complexes, and clusters that are associated with the protein matrix. The design of artificial metalloproteins and metalloenzymes not only reveals the structure and function relationship of natural proteins, but also enables the synthesis of artificial proteins and enzymes with improved properties and functions. Acknowledging the progress in rational design from single to multiple active sites, this review focuses on recent achievements in the design of artificial metalloproteins and metalloenzymes with metal clusters, including zinc clusters, cadmium clusters, iron-sulfur clusters, and copper-sulfur clusters, as well as noble metal clusters and others. These metal clusters were designed in both native and de novo protein scaffolds for structural roles, electron transfer, or catalysis. Some synthetic metal clusters as functional models of native enzymes are also discussed. These achievements provide valuable insights for deep understanding of the natural proteins and enzymes, and practical clues for the further design of artificial enzymes with functions comparable or even beyond those of natural counterparts.\\\\nNoncovalent weak interactions [hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen (H)-bond] play crucial roles in controlling the functions of biomolecules, and thus have been used to design artificial metalloproteins/metalloenzymes during the past few decades. In this review, we focus on the recent progresses in protein design by tuning the noncovalent interactions, including hydrophobic and H-bonding interactions. The topics include redesign and reuse of the heme pocket and other protein scaffolds, design of the heme protein interface, and de novo design of metalloproteins. The informations not only give insights into the metalloenzyme reaction mechanisms but also provide new reactions for future applications.\\\\n Artificial metalloenzymes result from the insertion of a catalytically active metal complex into a biological scaffold, generally a protein devoid of other catalytic functionalities. As such, their design requires efforts to engineer substrate binding, in addition to accommodating the artificial catalyst. Here we constructed and characterised artificial metalloenzymes using alcohol dehydrogenase as starting point, an enzyme which has both a cofactor and a substrate binding pocket. A docking approach was used to determine suitable positions for catalyst anchoring to single cysteine mutants, leading to an artificial metalloenzyme capable to reduce both natural cofactors and the hydrophobic 1-benzylnicotinamide mimic. Kinetic studies revealed that the new construct displayed a Michaelis-Menten behaviour with the native nicotinamide cofactors, which were suggested by docking to bind at a surface exposed site, different compared to their native binding position. On the other hand, the kinetic and docking data suggested that a typical enzyme behaviour was not observed with the hydrophobic 1-benzylnicotinamide mimic, with which binding events were plausible both inside and outside the protein. This work demonstrates an extended substrate scope of the artificial metalloenzymes and provides information about the binding sites of the nicotinamide substrates, which can be exploited to further engineer artificial metalloenzymes for cofactor regeneration. SYNOPSIS ABOUT GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: The manuscript provides information on the design of artificial metalloenzymes based on the bioconjugation of rhodium complexes to alcohol dehydrogenase, to improve their ability to reduce hydrophobic substrates. The graphical abstract presents different binding modes and results observed with native cofactors as substrates, compared to the hydrophobic benzylnicotinamide. \\\\n Protein design: toward functional metalloenzymes \\\\n Heteronuclear metalloenzymes catalyze some of the most fundamentally interesting and practically useful reactions in nature. However, the presence of two or more metal ions in close proximity in these enzymes makes them more difficult to prepare and study than homonuclear metalloenzymes. To meet these challenges, heteronuclear metal centers have been designed into small and stable proteins with rigid scaffolds to understand how these heteronuclear centers are constructed and the mechanism of their function. This chapter describes methods for designing heterobinuclear metal centers in a protein scaffold by giving specific examples of a few heme-nonheme bimetallic centers engineered in myoglobin and cytochrome c peroxidase. We provide step-by-step procedures on how to choose the protein scaffold, design a heterobinuclear metal center in the protein scaffold computationally, incorporate metal ions into the protein, and characterize the resulting metalloproteins, both structurally and functionally. Finally, we discuss how an initial design can be further improved by rationally tuning its secondary coordination sphere, electron/proton transfer rates, and the substrate affinity.\\\\nMany efforts are being made in the design and engineering of metalloenzymes with catalytic properties fulfilling the needs of practical applications. Progress in this field has recently been accelerated by advances in computational, molecular and structural biology. This review article focuses on the recent examples of oxygen-activating metalloenzymes, developed through the strategies of de novo design, miniaturization processes and protein redesign. Considerable progress in these diverse design approaches has produced many metal-containing biocatalysts able to adopt the functions of native enzymes or even novel functions beyond those found in Nature.\\\\nEmbedding a catalytically competent transition metal into a protein scaffold affords an artificial metalloenzyme (ArM). Such hybrid catalysts display features that are reminiscent of both homogeneous and enzymatic catalysts. Pioneered by Whitesides and Kaiser in the late 1970s, this field of ArMs has expanded over the past two decades, marked by ever-increasing diversity in reaction types, cofactors, and protein scaffolds. Recent noteworthy developments include i) the use of earth-abundant metal cofactors, ii) concurrent cascade reactions, iii) synergistic catalysis, and iv) in vivo catalysis. Thanks to significant progress in computational protein design, ArMs based on de novo-designed proteins and tailored chimeric proteins promise a bright future for this exciting field.\\\\n\\\\nIn recent years, several complementary strategies have been implemented for the creation and optimization of artificial metalloenzymes. Selected examples outline the pros and cons of five different approaches: catalytic antibodies, computational design, directed evolution, artificial metal-cofactors and DNAzymes.\\\\nMatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) belong to a family of zinc-dependent proteolytic metalloenzymes. MMP-9, a member of the gelatinase B family, is characterized as one of the most intricate MMPs. The crucial involvement of MMP-9 in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling underscores its significant correlation with each stage of cancer pathogenesis and progression. The design and synthesis of MMP-9 inhibitors is a potentially attractive research area. Unfortunately, to date, there is no effective MMP-9 inhibitor that passes the clinical trials and is approved by the FDA. This review primarily focuses on exploring the diverse strategies employed in the design and advancement of MMP-9 inhibitors, along with their anticancer effects and selectivity. To illuminate the essential structural characteristics necessary for the future design of novel MMP-9 inhibitors, the current narrative review highlights several recently discovered MMP-9 inhibitors exhibiting notable selectivity and potency.\\\\nHerein, we highlight a selection of recent successes in the creation of artificial metalloenzymes. A particular emphasis is set on different anchoring methods to incorporate the abiotic metal cofactor within the host protein as well as promising strategies for the de novo design of artificial metalloenzymes. Both approaches yield promiscuous catalytic activities which expand the catalytic repertoire of biocatalysis and synthetic biology. Moreover, we summarize laboratory evolution protocols which have contributed to unravel the full potential of artificial metalloenzymes.\\\\nThree-helix bundles and coiled-coil motifs are well-established de novo designed scaffolds that have been investigated for their metal-binding and catalytic properties. Satisfaction of the primary coordination sphere for a given metal is sufficient to introduce catalytic activity and a given structure may catalyze different reactions dependent on the identity of the incorporated metal. Here we describe recent contributions in the de novo design of metalloenzymes based on three-helix bundles and coiled-coil motifs, focusing on non-heme systems for hydrolytic and redox chemistry.
