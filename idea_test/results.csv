As such, their design requires efforts to engineer substrate binding, in addition to accommodating the artificial catalyst. Here we constructed and characterised artificial metalloenzymes using alcohol dehydrogenase as starting point, an enzyme which has both a cofactor and a substrate binding pocket. A docking approach was used to determine suitable positions for catalyst anchoring to single cysteine mutants, leading to an artificial metalloenzyme capable to reduce both natural cofactors and the hydrophobic 1-benzylnicotinamide mimic. Kinetic studies revealed that the new construct displayed a Michaelis-Menten behaviour with the native nicotinamide cofactors, which were suggested by docking to bind at a surface exposed site, different compared to their native binding position. On the other hand, the kinetic and docking data suggested that a typical enzyme behaviour was not observed with the hydrophobic 1-benzylnicotinamide mimic, with which binding events were plausible both inside and outside the protein. This work demonstrates an extended substrate scope of the artificial metalloenzymes and provides information about the binding sites of the nicotinamide substrates, which can be exploited to further engineer artificial metalloenzymes for cofactor regeneration.

To solve this problem, this work develops the synthesis in an aqueous medium of a new Mn metalloenzyme with laccase oxidase mimetic catalytic activity. Geobacillus thermocatenulatus lipase (GTL) was used as a scaffold enzyme, mixed with a manganese salt at 50 °C in an aqueous medium. This leads to the in situ formation of manganese(IV) oxide nanowires that interact with the enzyme, yielding a GTL-Mn bionanohybrid. On the other hand, its oxidative activity was evaluated using the ABTS assay, obtaining a catalytic efficiency 300 times higher than that of Trametes versicolor laccase. This new Mn metalloenzyme was 2 times more stable at 40 °C, 3 times more stable in the presence of 10% acetonitrile, and 10 times more stable in 20% acetonitrile than Novozym 51003 laccase.

Native metalloenzymes use a set of redox-active amino acids and cofactors as redox centers, with a potential range between -700 and +800 mV versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE, all reduction potentials are versus SHE). The redox potentials and the orientation of redox centers in native metalloproteins are optimal for their redox chemistry. However, the limited number and potential range of native redox centers challenge the design and optimization of novel redox chemistry in metalloenzymes. Artificial metalloenzymes use non-native redox centers and could go far beyond the natural range of redox potentials for novel redox chemistry. In addition to designing protein monomers, strategies for increasing the electron transfer rate in self-assembled protein complexes and protein-electrode or -nanomaterial interfaces will be discussed. Redox reactions in proteins occur on redox active amino acid residues (Tyr, Trp, Met, Cys, etc.) and cofactors (iron sulfur clusters, flavin, heme, etc.). The redox potential of these redox centers cover a ∼1.5 V range and is optimized for their specific functions. Despite recent progress, tuning the redox potential for amino acid residues or cofactors remains challenging. Many redox-active unnatural amino acids (UAAs) can be incorporated into protein via genetic codon expansion. Their redox potentials extend the range of physiologically relevant potentials. Indeed, installing new redox cofactors with fined-tuned redox potentials is essential for designing novel redox enzymes. By combining UAA and redox cofactor incorporation, we harnessed light energy to reduce CO2 in a fluorescent protein, mimicking photosynthetic apparatus in nature. Manipulating the position and reduction potential of redox centers inside proteins is important for optimizing the electron transfer rate and the activity of artificial enzymes. Learning from the native electron transfer complex, protein-protein interactions can be enhanced by increasing the electrostatic interaction between proteins. An artificial oxidase showed close to native enzyme activity with optimized interaction with electron transfer partner and increased electron transfer efficiency. In addition to the de novo design of protein-protein interaction, protein self-assembly methods using scaffolds, such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen, to efficiently anchor enzymes and their redox partners. The self-assembly process enhances electron transfer efficiency and enzyme activity by bringing redox centers into close proximity of each other. In addition to protein self-assembly, protein-electrode or protein-nanomaterial self-assembly can also promote efficient electron transfer from inorganic materials to enzyme active sites. Such hybrid systems combine the efficiency of enzyme reactions and the robustness of electrodes or nanomaterials, often with advantageous catalytic activities. By combining these strategies, we can not only mimic some of nature's most fascinating reactions, such as photosynthesis and aerobic respiration, but also transcend nature toward environmental, energy, and health applications.",True,True,,"Catalysis, Coenzymeschemistry, Electron Transport, Metalloproteinschemistrygenetics, Oxidation-Reduction, Photosynthesis, Protein Engineering"

Therefore, the environment beyond the primary coordination sphere must play an important role in both conferring and tuning their phenomenal catalytic properties, enabling active sites with otherwise similar primary coordination environments to perform a diverse array of biological functions. However, since the interactions beyond the primary coordination sphere are numerous and weak, it has been difficult to pinpoint structural features responsible for the tuning of activities of native enzymes. Designing artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) offers an excellent basis to elucidate the roles of these interactions and to further develop practical biological catalysts. In this review, we highlight how the secondary coordination spheres of ArMs influence metal binding and catalysis, with particular focus on the use of native protein scaffolds as templates for the design of ArMs by either rational design aided by computational modeling, directed evolution, or a combination of both approaches. In describing successes in designing heme, nonheme Fe, and Cu metalloenzymes, heteronuclear metalloenzymes containing heme, and those ArMs containing other metal centers (including those with non-native metal ions and metallocofactors), we have summarized insights gained on how careful controls of the interactions in the secondary coordination sphere, including hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions, allow the generation and tuning of these respective systems to approach, rival, and, in a few cases, exceed those of native enzymes.

Sulfonamides and their isosteres (sulfamates/sulfamides) constitute the main class of CAIs which bind to the metal ion in the enzyme active site. Recently the dithiocarbamates, possessing a similar mechanism of action, were reported as a new class of inhibitors. Other families of CAIs possess a distinct mechanism of action: phenols, polyamines, some carboxylates, and sulfocoumarins anchor to the zinc-coordinated water molecule. Coumarins and five/six-membered lactones are prodrug inhibitors, binding in hydrolyzed form at the entrance of the active site cavity. Novel drug design strategies have been reported principally based on the tail approach for obtaining all these types of CAIs, which exploit more external binding regions within the enzyme active site (in addition to coordination to the metal ion), leading thus to isoform-selective compounds.

The quality of their design strongly depends on how three partners interact: the biological host, the ""artificial cofactor,"" and the substrate. However, structural characterization of functional artificial metalloenzymes by X-ray or NMR is often partial, elusive, or absent. How the cofactor binds to the protein, how the receptor reorganizes upon the binding of the cofactor and the substrate, and which are the binding mode(s) of the substrate for the reaction to proceed are key questions that are frequently unresolved yet crucial for ArM design. Such questions may eventually be solved by molecular modeling but require a step change beyond the current state-of-the-art methodologies.Here, we summarize our efforts in the study of ArMs, presenting both the development of computational strategies and their application. We first focus on our integrative computational framework that incorporates a variety of methods such as protein-ligand docking, classical molecular dynamics (MD), and pure quantum mechanical (QM) methods, which, when properly combined, are able to depict questions that range from host-cofactor binding predictions to simulations of entire catalytic mechanisms. We also pay particular attention to the protein-ligand docking strategies that we have developed to accurately predict the binding of transition metal-containing molecules to proteins. While this aspect is fundamental to many bioinorganic fields beyond ArMs, it has been disregarded from the molecular modeling landscape until very recently.Next we describe how to apply this computational framework to particular ArMs including systems previously characterized experimentally as well as others where computation served to guide the design. We start with the prediction of the interactions between homogeneous catalysts and biological hosts. Protein-ligand docking is pivotal at that stage, but it needs to be combined with QM/MM or MD approaches when the binding of the cofactor implies significant conformational changes of the protein or involve changes of the electronic state of the metal.Then, we summarize molecular modeling studies aimed at identifying cofactor-substrate arrangements inside the ArM active pocket that are consistent with its reactivity. These calculations stand on ""Theozyme""-like dockings, MD-refined or not, which provide molecular rationale of the catalytic profiles of the artificial systems.In the third section, we present case studies to decode the entire catalytic mechanism of two ArMs: (1) an iridium based asymmetric transfer hydrogenase obtained by insertion of Noyori's catalyst into streptavidin and (2) a metallohydrolase achieved by including a receptor. Transition states, second coordination sphere effects, as well as motions of the cofactors are identified as drivers of the enantiomeric profiles.Finally, we report computer-aided designs of ArMs to guide experiments toward chemical and mutational changes that improve their activity and/or enantioselective profiles and expand toward future directions.",True,True,,"Biomimetic Materialschemistry, Enzymesmetabolism, Metalloproteinsmetabolism"

However, metalloenzymes are occasionally surprising in their selection of catalytic metals, and in their responses to metal substitution. Indeed, from the isolated standpoint of producing the best catalyst, a chemist designing from first-principles would likely choose a different metal. For example, some enzymes employ a redox active metal where a simple Lewis acid is needed. Such are several hydrolases. In other cases, substitution of a non-native metal leads to radical improvements in reactivity. For example, histone deacetylase 8 naturally operates with Zn(2+) in the active site but becomes much more active with Fe(2+). For β-lactamases, the replacement of the native Zn(2+) with Ni(2+) was suggested to lead to higher activity as predicted computationally. There are also intriguing cases, such as Fe(2+)- and Mn(2+)-dependent ribonucleotide reductases and W(4+)- and Mo(4+)-dependent DMSO reductases, where organisms manage to circumvent the scarcity of one metal (e.g., Fe(2+)) by creating protein structures that utilize another metal (e.g., Mn(2+)) for the catalysis of the same reaction. Naturally, even though both metal forms are active, one of the metals is preferred in every-day life, and the other metal variant remains dormant until an emergency strikes in the cell. These examples lead to certain questions. When are catalytic metals selected purely for electronic or structural reasons, implying that enzymatic catalysis is optimized to its maximum? When are metal selections a manifestation of competing evolutionary pressures, where choices are dictated not just by catalytic efficiency but also by other factors in the cell? In other words, how can enzymes be improved as catalysts merely through the use of common biological building blocks available to cells? Addressing these questions is highly relevant to the enzyme design community, where the goal is to prepare maximally efficient quasi-natural enzymes for the catalysis of reactions that interest humankind. Due to competing evolutionary pressures, many natural enzymes may not have evolved to be ideal catalysts and can be improved for the isolated purpose of catalysis in vitro when the competing factors are removed. The goal of this Account is not to cover all the possible stories but rather to highlight how variable enzymatic catalysis can be. We want to bring up possible factors affecting the evolution of enzyme structure, and the large- and intermediate-scale structural and electronic effects that metals can induce in the protein, and most importantly, the opportunities for optimization of these enzymes for catalysis in vitro.",True,True,,"Biocatalysis, Humans, Metalloproteinschemistrymetabolism, Metalschemistrymetabolism, Models, Molecular"

In this article we describe recent advances in the design of a unique class of artificial hydrogen evolving catalysts that combine the features of the active site metal(s) surrounded by a polypeptide component. The examples of these biosynthetic catalysts discussed here include i) assemblies of synthetic cofactors with native proteins; ii) peptide-appended synthetic complexes; iii) substitution of native cofactors with non-native cofactors; iv) metal substitution from rubredoxin; and v) a reengineered Cu storage protein into a Ni binding protein. Aspects of key design considerations in the construction of these artificial biocatalysts and insights gained into their chemical reactivity are discussed.,True,True,,"Catalysis, Catalytic Domain, Hydrogenchemistry, Hydrogenasechemistrymetabolism, Organic Chemicalschemistry"

In this review, we first describe the importance of tuning the redox potential of ET centers and its role in regulating the ET in bioenergetic processes including photosynthesis and respiration. The main focus of this review is to summarize recent work in designing the ET centers, namely cupredoxins, cytochromes, and iron-sulfur proteins, and examples in design of protein networks involved these ET centers. We then discuss the factors that affect redox potentials of these ET centers including metal ion, the ligands to metal center and interactions beyond the primary ligand, especially non-covalent secondary coordination sphere interactions. We provide examples of strategies to fine-tune the redox potential using both natural and unnatural amino acids and native and nonnative cofactors.

Incorporating boron into carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) can modulate the ligand ability to recognize the target and/or influence selectivity towards different CA isoforms, using the tail approach and boron-based tails. The electron-deficient nature of boron and its associated properties have also led to the discovery of novel zinc-binding CAIs, such as boronic acids and the benzoxaboroles, capable of inhibiting the CAs upon a Lewis acid-base mechanism of action.

In this research, non-toxic and high-performance metalloenzyme mimics of Zn2+-bonding peptides were developed by obtaining inspiration from phosphotriesterase (PTE) and nanofiber formation. Furthermore, based on the electrochemical activity of p-nitrophenol (PNP), the electrochemical sensor of metalloenzyme mimics was developed. By examining the effect of the active sites of peptides and fibril formation on the degradation of OPs, the optimal metalloenzyme mimic was selected. Furthermore, optimal metalloenzyme mimics were combined with NiCo2O4 to develop an electrochemical sensor of OPs. By monitoring square wave voltammetry (SWV) signals of PNP degraded from OPs, the amounts of OPs in actual samples could be determined in 15 min. We discovered that both the active sites of α metal and β metal were required for metalloenzyme mimics; Zn2+ promoted peptide fibrosis and especially acted as a cofactor for degrading OPs. Compared to traditional methods, the electrochemical sensor of metalloenzyme mimics was sensitive, reliable, and non-toxic; furthermore, the detection limit of methyl paraoxon was as low as 0.08 µM.

In particular, the design of ArMs by the supramolecular anchoring of metal catalysts to protein hosts provides flexible and easy to optimise systems. The use of cofactor dependent enzymes as hosts gives the advantage of both a (hydrophobic) binding site for the substrate and a cofactor pocket to accommodate the catalyst. Here, we present a computationally driven design approach of ArMs for the transfer hydrogenation reaction of cyclic imines, starting from the NADP+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobacter brockii (TbADH). We tested and developed a molecular docking workflow to define and optimize iridium catalysts with high affinity for the cofactor binding site of TbADH. The workflow uses high throughput docking of compound libraries to identify key structural motifs for high affinity, followed by higher accuracy docking methods on smaller, focused ligand and catalyst libraries. Iridium sulfonamide catalysts were selected and synthesised, containing either a triol, a furane, or a carboxylic acid to provide the interaction with the cofactor binding pocket. IC50 values of the resulting complexes during TbADH-catalysed alcohol oxidation were determined by competition experiments and were between 4.410 mM and 0.052 mM, demonstrating the affinity of the iridium complexes for either the substrate or the cofactor binding pocket of TbADH. The catalytic activity of the free iridium complexes in solution showed a maximal turnover number (TON) of 90 for the reduction of salsolidine by the triol-functionalised iridium catalyst, whilst in the presence of TbADH, only the iridium catalyst with the triol anchoring functionality showed activity for the same reaction (TON of 36 after 24 h). The observation that the artificial metalloenzymes developed here lacked stereoselectivity demonstrates the need for the further investigation and optimisation of the ArM.

Twenty-eight positions have been subjected to mutagenesis to yield 335 Sav isoforms, which can be expressed in 24-deep-well plates using autoinduction medium. The resulting cell-free extracts (CFEs) typically contain >1 mg of soluble Sav. Two straightforward alternatives are presented, which allow the screening of ArMs using CFEs containing Sav. To produce an artificial transfer hydrogenase, Sav is coupled to a biotinylated three-legged iridium pianostool complex Cp*Ir(Biot-p-L)Cl (the cofactor). To screen Sav variants for this application, you would determine the number of free binding sites, treat them with diamide, incubate them with the cofactor and then perform the reaction with your test compound (the example used in this protocol is 1-phenyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline). This process takes 20 d. If you want to perform metathesis reactions, Sav is coupled to a biotinylated second-generation Grubbs-Hoveyda catalyst.

Several tools have recently been developed to expand the natural enzymatic repertoire with abiotic reactions. For example, artificial metalloenzymes, which combine the versatile reaction scope of transition metals with the beneficial catalytic features of enzymes, offer an attractive means to engineer new reactions. Three complementary strategies exist: repurposing natural metalloenzymes for abiotic transformations; in silico metalloenzyme (re-)design; and incorporation of abiotic cofactors into proteins. The third strategy offers the opportunity to design a wide variety of artificial metalloenzymes for non-natural reactions. However, many metal cofactors are inhibited by cellular components and therefore require purification of the scaffold protein. This limits the throughput of genetic optimization schemes applied to artificial metalloenzymes and their applicability in vivo to expand natural metabolism. Here we report the compartmentalization and in vivo evolution of an artificial metalloenzyme for olefin metathesis, which represents an archetypal organometallic reaction without equivalent in nature. Building on previous work on an artificial metallohydrolase, we exploit the periplasm of Escherichia coli as a reaction compartment for the 'metathase' because it offers an auspicious environment for artificial metalloenzymes, mainly owing to low concentrations of inhibitors such as glutathione, which has recently been identified as a major inhibitor. This strategy facilitated the assembly of a functional metathase in vivo and its directed evolution with substantially increased throughput compared to conventional approaches that rely on purified protein variants. The evolved metathase compares favourably with commercial catalysts, shows activity for different metathesis substrates and can be further evolved in different directions by adjusting the workflow.

Despite the impressive advances made in the field, the ultimate goal of designing efficient enzyme mimics for these reactions is still elusive. Its realization will require a deeper understanding of the diverse chemical factors that influence the activities of both natural and synthetic catalysts. They include catalyst-substrate complexation, non-covalent interactions and the electronic nature of the metal ion, ligand environment and nucleophile. Based on our computational studies, their roles are discussed for several mono- and binuclear metallohydrolases and their synthetic analogues. Hydrolysis by natural metallohydrolases is found to be promoted by a ligand environment with low basicity, a metal bound water and a heterobinuclear metal center (in binuclear enzymes). Additionally, peptide and phosphoester hydrolysis is dominated by two competing effects, i.e. nucleophilicity and Lewis acid activation, respectively. In synthetic analogues, hydrolysis is facilitated by the inclusion of a second metal center, hydrophobic effects, a biological metal (Zn, Cu and Co) and a terminal hydroxyl nucleophile. Due to the absence of the protein environment, hydrolysis by these small molecules is exclusively influenced by nucleophile activation. The results gleaned from these studies will enhance the understanding of fundamental principles of multiple hydrolytic reactions.

This study reports a method that can be used to create an artificial metal-binding site prior to proving it to be functional in a wet lab. Haloalkane dehalogenase was grafted into a metal-binding site to form an artificial metallo-haloalkane dehalogenase and was studied for its potential functionalities in silico. Computational protocols regarding dynamic metal docking were studied using native metalloenzymes and functional artificial metalloenzymes. Using YASARA Structure, a simulation box covering template structure was created to be filled with water molecules followed by one mutated water molecule closest to the metal-binding site to metal ion. A simple energy minimization step was subsequently run using an AMBER force field to allow the metal ion to interact with the metal-binding residues. Long molecular dynamic simulation using YASARA Structure was performed to analyze the stability of the metal-binding site and the distance between metal-binding residues. Metal ions fluctuating around 2.0 Å across a 20 ns simulation indicated a stable metal-binding site. Metal-binding energies were predicted using FoldX, with a native metalloenzyme (carbonic anhydrase) scoring 18.0 kcal/mol and the best mutant model (C1a) scoring 16.4 kcal/mol. Analysis of the metal-binding site geometry was performed using CheckMyMetal, and all scores for the metalloenzymes and mutant models were in an acceptable range. Like native metalloenzymes, the metal-binding site of C1a was supported by residues in the second coordination shell to maintain a more coordinated metal-binding site. Short-chain multihalogenated alkanes (1,2-dibromoethane and 1,2,3-trichloropropane) were able to dock in the active site of C1a. The halides of the substrate were in contact with both the metal and halide-stabilizing residues, thus indicating a better stabilization of the substrate. The simple catalytic mechanism proposed is that the metal ion interacted with halogen and polarized the carbon-halogen bond, thus making the alpha carbon susceptible to attack by nucleophilic hydroxide. The interaction between halogen in the metal ion and halide-stabilizing residues may help to improve the stabilization of the substrate-enzyme complex and reduce the activation energy. This study reports a modified dynamic metal-docking protocol and validation tests to verify the metal-binding site. These approaches can be applied to design different kinds of artificial metalloenzymes or metal-binding sites.",True,False,,

It is required to perform extensive sampling, properly treat the electronic structure of the bound metal or metals, and seamlessly merge the required techniques to assess energies and entropies, or their changes, for the entire system. Additionally, the machinery needs to be computationally affordable. Although a great advancement has been made over the years, including some of the seminal works resulting in the 2013 Nobel Prize in chemistry, many aforementioned exciting applications remain far from reach.

To do so, enzymes in general have evolved tools and tricks to enable control of such reactivity. The underlying concepts related to these tools are usually well-known to enzymologists and bio(inorganic) chemists but may be a little less familiar to organometallic chemists. So far, the field of bioinspired catalysis has greatly focused on the coordination sphere and electronic effects for the design of functional enzyme models but might benefit from a paradigm shift related to recent findings in biological systems.

Designed metalloproteins featuring synthetic metal clusters would aid in the design of bio-inspired catalysts for various applications in synthetic biology. The design of metal ion-binding sites in a protein chain requires geometrically constrained and accurate placement of several (between three and six) polar and/or charged amino acid side chains for every metal ion, making the design problem very challenging to address. Here, we describe a general computational method to redesign oligomeric interfaces of symmetric proteins for the purpose of creating novel multinuclear metalloproteins with tunable geometries, electrochemical environments, and metal cofactor stability via first and second-shell interactions. The method requires a target symmetric organometallic cofactor whose coordinating ligands resemble the side chains of a natural or unnatural amino acid and a library of oligomeric protein structures featuring the same symmetry as the target cofactor. Geometric interface matches between target cofactor and scaffold are determined using a program that we call symmetric protein recursive ion-cofactor sampler (SyPRIS). First, the amino acid-bound organometallic cofactor model is built and symmetrically aligned to the axes of symmetry of each scaffold. Depending on the symmetry, rigid body and inverse rotameric degrees of freedom of the cofactor model are then simultaneously sampled to locate scaffold backbone constellations that are geometrically poised to incorporate the cofactor. Optionally, backbone remodeling of loops can be performed if no perfect matches are identified. Finally, the identities of spatially proximal neighbor residues of the cofactor are optimized using Rosetta Design.

Various metalloenzymes such as hydrogenase, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, nitrogenase, laccase and cytochrome P450 BM3 have been functionalized with Ru(II)-diimine complexes.

It has been proposed that the earliest enzymes may have arisen from the self-assembly of short peptides into supramolecular amyloid-like structures. Several artificial amyloids have been shown to display catalytic activity while offering advantages over natural enzymes in terms of modularity, flexibility, stability, and reusability. Hydrolases, especially esterases, are the most common artificial amyloid-like nanozymes with some reported to act as carbonic anhydrases (CA). Their hydrolytic activity is often dependent on the binding of metallic cofactors through a coordination triad composed of His residues in the β-strands, which mimic the arrangement found in natural metalloenzymes. Tyr residues contribute to the coordination of metal ions in the active center of metalloproteins; however, their use has been mostly neglected in the design of metal-containing amyloid-based nanozymes. We recently reported that four different polar prion-inspired heptapeptides spontaneously self-assembled into amyloid fibrils. Their sequences lack His but contain three alternate Tyr residues exposed to solvent. We combine experiments and simulations to demonstrate that the amyloid fibrils formed by these peptides can efficiently coordinate and retain different divalent metal cations, functioning as both metal scavengers and nanozymes. The metallized fibrils exhibit esterase and CA activities without the need for a histidine triad. These findings highlight the functional versatility of prion-inspired peptide assemblies and provide a new sequential context for the creation of artificial metalloenzymes.

This Feature Article highlights ligand designs that allow for cooperative small molecule activation at cluster complexes, with a particular focus on complexes that contain metal-metal bonds. Two useful ligand-design elements have emerged from this work: a degree of geometric flexibility, which allows for novel small molecule activation modes, and the use of redox-active ligands to provide electronic flexibility to the cluster core. The authors have incorporated these factors into a unique class of dinucleating macrocycles (nPDI2). Redox-active fragments in nPDI2 mimic the weak-overlap covalent bonding that is characteristic of M-M interactions, and aliphatic linkers in the ligand backbone provide geometric flexibility, allowing for interconversion between a range of geometries as the dinuclear core responds to the requirements of various small molecule substrates.

However, because of the immense number of possibilities, the availability of enzymes that possess a basal level of the desired catalytic activity is a prerequisite for success. For new-to-nature reactions, artificial metalloenzymes (ARMs), which are rationally designed hybrids of proteins and catalytically active transition-metal complexes, can be such a starting point. This Account details our efforts toward the creation of ARMs for the catalysis of new-to-nature reactions. Key to our approach is the notion that the binding of substrates, that is, effective molarity, is a key component to achieving large accelerations in catalysis. For this reason, our designs are based on the multidrug resistance regulator LmrR, a dimeric transcription factor with a large, hydrophobic binding pocket at its dimer interface. In this pocket, there are two tryptophan moieties, which are important for promiscuous binding of planar hydrophobic conjugated compounds by π-stacking. The catalytic machinery is introduced either by the covalent linkage of a catalytically active metal complex or via the ligand or supramolecular assembly, taking advantage of the two central tryptophan moieties for noncovalent binding of transition-metal complexes. Designs based on the chemical modification of LmrR were successful in catalysis, but this approach proved too laborious to be practical. Therefore, expanded genetic code methodologies were used to introduce metal binding unnatural amino acids during LmrR biosynthesis in vivo. These ARMs have been successfully applied in Cu(II) catalyzed Friedel-Crafts alkylation of indoles. The extension to MDRs from the TetR family resulted in ARMs capable of providing the opposite enantiomer of the Friedel-Crafts product. We have employed a computationally assisted redesign of these ARMs to create a more active and selective artificial hydratase, introducing a glutamate as a general base at a judicious position so it can activate and direct the incoming water nucleophile. A supramolecularly assembled ARM from LmrR and copper(II)-phenanthroline was successful in Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions, giving rise to up to 94% ee. Also, hemin was bound, resulting in an artificial heme enzyme for enantioselective cyclopropanation reactions. The importance of structural dynamics of LmrR was suggested by computational studies, which showed that the pore can open up to allow access of substrates to the catalytic iron center, which, according to the crystal structure, is deeply buried inside the protein. Finally, the assembly approaches were combined to introduce both a catalytic and a regulatory domain, resulting in an ARM that was specifically activated in the presence of Fe(II) salts but not Zn(II) salts. Our work demonstrates that LmrR is a privileged scaffold for ARM design: It allows for multiple assembly methods and even combinations of these, it can be applied in a variety of different catalytic reactions, and it shows significant structural dynamics that contribute to achieving the desired catalytic activity. Moreover, both the creation via expanded genetic code methods as well as the supramolecular assembly make LmrR-based ARMs highly suitable for achieving the ultimate goal of the integration of ARMs in biosynthetic pathways in vivo to create a hybrid metabolism.",True,False,,"Bacterial Proteinsgenetics, Binding Sites, Catalysis, Coordination Complexeschemistry, Copperchemistry, Enzymeschemistrygenetics, Metalloproteinschemistrygenetics, Protein Engineering, Transcription Factorsgenetics"

Herein, we have aimed to address these studies, to determine whether the family of M1 aminopeptidases does in fact present a universal target for the treatment of a diverse range of human diseases. Our analysis indicates that early validation of M1 aminopeptidases as therapeutic targets is often overlooked, which prevents the enzymes from being confirmed as drug targets. This validation cannot be neglected, and needs to include a thorough characterization of enzymes' specific roles within complex physiological pathways. Furthermore, any chemical probes used in target validation must be carefully designed to ensure that specificity over the closely related enzymes has been achieved.

Whereas progress has been made in designing proteins that mimic native proteins structurally, it is more difficult to design functional proteins. In comparison to recent successes in designing non-metalloproteins, it is even more challenging to rationally design metalloproteins that reproduce both the structure and function of native metalloenzymes. This is because protein metal-binding sites are much more varied than non-metal-containing sites, in terms of different metal ion oxidation states, preferred geometry and metal ion ligand donor sets. Because of their variability, it has been difficult to predict metal-binding site properties in silico, as many of the parameters, such as force fields, are ill-defined. Therefore, the successful design of a structural and functional metalloprotein would greatly advance the field of protein design and our understanding of enzymes. Here we report a successful, rational design of a structural and functional model of a metalloprotein, nitric oxide reductase (NOR), by introducing three histidines and one glutamate, predicted as ligands in the active site of NOR, into the distal pocket of myoglobin.

Several enzymes exploit the unique features of metal cofactors to achieve catalytic activity otherwise unattainable through the use of only natural amino acid residues. One of the major bottlenecks in ab initio design of novel proteins relies on long-range and epistatic effects that severely limit the possibility of a rational design. Within this framework there is an ongoing effort to reduce protein length and complexity to unlock the full potential of in silico protein design. In this work we specifically address this problem designing and investigating the dynamic features of 10 in silico designed minimal metallo-proteins. In particular, in this paper we investigate whether and to what extent it is possible to design a minimal metallo-enzyme made of only residues involved in metal binding. In this research we address these questions by investigating the ability of 10 different ""mini-proteins"" with a length shorter than 15 residues. Molecular dynamics studies clearly show that it is possible to design a minimal protein able to bind a metal atom with the correct geometry. It is noteworthy that designed mini-proteins cannot achieve the formation of a canonical hydrophobic core, rather the metal ion provides a ""metal core"" around which the entire protein is organized.

In this work, we approach this matter by assessing the dynamics and stability of a series of ArMs resulting from the inclusion, via different anchoring strategies, of a variety of organometallic cofactors into the Lactococcal multidrug resistance regulator (LmrR) protein. To this aim, we coupled standard force field-based techniques such as Protein-Ligand Docking and Molecular Dynamics simulations with a variety of trajectory convergence analyses, capable of assessing both the stability and flexibility of the different systems under study upon the binding of cofactors. Together with the experimental evidence obtained in other studies, we provide an overview on how these changes can affect the catalytic outcomes obtained from the different ArMs. Fundamentally, our results show that the convergence analysis used in this work can assess how the inclusion of synthetic metallic cofactors in proteins can condition different structural modulations of their host.

Here, we report on structural and functional aspects of the multimodular TTM1 and TTM2 of Arabidopsis thaliana. Our tissue and cellular microscopy studies show that both AtTTM1 and AtTTM2 are expressed in actively dividing (meristem) tissue and are tail-anchored proteins at the outer mitochondrial membrane, mediated by the single C-terminal transmembrane domain, supporting earlier studies. In addition, we reveal from crystal structures of AtTTM1 in the presence and absence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog a catalytically incompetent TTM tunnel domain tightly interacting with the P-loop kinase domain that is locked in an inactive conformation. Our structural comparison indicates that a helical hairpin may facilitate movement of the TTM domain, thereby activating the kinase. Furthermore, we conducted genetic studies to show that AtTTM2 is important for the developmental transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase in Arabidopsis, whereas its closest paralog AtTTM1 is not. We demonstrate through rational design of mutations based on the 3D structure that both the P-loop kinase and TTM tunnel modules of AtTTM2 are required for the developmental switch.

Consequently, metalloenzymes represent a vast and largely untapped space for drug development. The discovery of effective therapeutics that target metalloenzymes lies squarely at the interface of bioinorganic and medicinal chemistry and requires expertise, methods, and strategies from both fields to mount an effective campaign. In this Account, our research program that brings together the principles and methods of bioinorganic and medicinal chemistry are described, in an effort to bridge the gap between these fields and address an important class of medicinal targets. Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) is an important drug discovery approach that is particularly well suited for metalloenzyme inhibitor development. FBDD uses relatively small but diverse chemical structures that allow for the assembly of privileged molecular collections that focus on a specific feature of the target enzyme. For metalloenzyme inhibition, the specific feature is rather obvious, namely, a metal-dependent active site. Surprisingly, prior to our work, the exploration of diverse molecular fragments for binding the metal active sites of metalloenzymes was largely unexplored. By assembling a modest library of metal-binding pharmacophores (MBPs), we have been able to find lead hits for many metalloenzymes and, from these hits, develop inhibitors that act via novel mechanisms of action. A specific case study on the use of this strategy to identify a first-in-class inhibitor of zinc-dependent Rpn11 (a component of the proteasome) is highlighted. The application of FBDD for the development of metalloenzyme inhibitors has raised several other compelling questions, such as how the metalloenzyme active site influences the coordination chemistry of bound fragments, how one can identify the best fragments for a given metalloenzyme, and many others. Among the most significant, and concerning, questions for metalloenzyme inhibition are those that reside around issues of specificity and whether metalloenzyme inhibitors can be as selective and specific as other small molecule inhibitors (i.e., compounds that inhibit enzymes that do not utilize a metal at their active site). This also leads to the question of whether metalloenzyme inhibitors might interfere more broadly with the metallome. Efforts to address these and related questions are discussed, with the expectation that our findings will illuminate some of these topics, alleviate some of these concerns, and encourage greater interest in this important, undervalued class of drug targets.",True,False,,"Drug Delivery Systems, Drug Design, Drug Discovery, Enzymeschemistry, Metalloproteinschemistry"

Tetrahedral geometry of the sulfonyl function may be favorable than planar carboxyl function regarding the interaction between the aryl group and S1' pocket. Hydroxamates may impart higher inhibition than corresponding carboxylates due to additional hydrogen bonding.

Here, we demonstrate how the incorporation of new tools in multiscale strategies, namely substrate diffusion exploration, allows taking a step further. As a showcase, the enantioselective profiles of the most outstanding variants of an artificial Rh2-based cyclopropanase (GSH, HFF and RFY) developed by Lewis and co-workers (Nat. Commun., 2015, 6, 7789 and Nat. Chem., 2018, 10, 318-324) have been rationalized. DFT calculations on the free-cofactor-mediated process identify the carbene insertion and the cyclopropanoid formation as crucial events, the latter being the enantiodetermining step, which displays up to 8 competitive orientations easily altered by the protein environment. The key intermediates of the reaction were docked into the protein scaffold showing that some mutated residues have direct interaction with the cofactor and/or the co-substrate. These interactions take the form of a direct coordination of Rh in GSH and HFF and a strong hydrophobic patch with the carbene moiety in RFY. Posterior molecular dynamics sustain that the cofactor induces global re-arrangements of the protein. Finally, massive exploration of substrate diffusion, based on the GPathFinder approach, defines this event as the origin of the enantioselectivity in GSH and RFY. For HFF, fine molecular dockings suggest that it is likely related to local interactions upon diffusion.

This approach is particularly relevant because nature teaches us that CO2 reduction is possible, with low overpotentials, high rates, and large selectivity, and gives us unique clues to design and discover new interesting molecular catalysts. Indeed, on the basis of our relatively advanced understanding of the structures and mechanisms of the active sites of fascinating metalloenzymes such as formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) and CO dehydrogenases (CODHs), it is possible to design original, active, selective, and stable molecular catalysts using the bioinspired approach. These metalloenzymes use fascinating metal centers: in FDHs, a Mo(W) mononuclear ion is coordinated by four sulfur atoms provided by a specific organic ligand, molybdopterin (MPT), containing a pyranopterin heterocycle (composed of a pyran ring fused with a pterin unit) and two sulfhydryl groups for metal chelation; in CODHs, catalytic activity depends on either a unique nickel-iron-sulfur cluster or a dinuclear Mo-Cu complex in which the Mo ion is chelated by an MPT ligand. As a consequence, the novel class of catalysts, designed by bioinspiration, consists of mononuclear Mo, W, and Ni and as well as dinuclear Mo-Cu and Ni-Fe complexes in which the metal ions are coordinated by sulfur ligands, more specifically, dithiolene chelates mimicking the natural MPT cofactor. In general, their activity is evaluated in electrochemical systems (cyclic voltammetry and bulk electrolysis) or in photochemical systems (in the presence of a photosensitizer and a sacrificial electron donor) in solution. This research is multidisciplinary because it implies detailed biochemical, functional, and structural characterization of the inspiring enzymes together with synthetic organic and organometallic chemistry and molecular catalysis studies. The most important achievements in this direction, starting from the first report of a catalytically active biomimetic bis-dithiolene-Mo complex in 2015, are discussed in this Account, highlighting the challenging issues associated with synthesis of such sophisticated ligands and molecular catalysts as well as the complexity of reaction mechanisms. While the very first active biomimetic catalysts require further improvement, in terms of performance, they set the stage in which molecular chemistry and enzymology can synergistically cooperate for a better understanding of why nature has selected these sites and for developing highly active catalysts.",True,False,,"Carbon Dioxide, Catalysis, Catalytic Domain, Formate Dehydrogenases, Sulfur"

This degradation helps maintain the global carbon cycle and has increasing applications ranging from the biodegradation of pollutants to the biocatalytic production of drugs and hormones. We have been using Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 as a model organism to understand the catabolic versatility of Rhodococcus and related bacteria. Our approach is exemplified by the discovery of a cluster of genes specifying the catabolism of cholesterol. This degradation proceeds via β-oxidative degradation of the side chain and O2-dependent cleavage of steroid ring A in a process similar to bacterial degradation of aromatic compounds. The pathway is widespread in Actinobacteria and is critical to the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, arguably the world's most successful pathogen. The close similarity of some of these enzymes with biphenyl- and polychlorinated-biphenyl-degrading enzymes that we have characterized is facilitating inhibitor design. Our studies in RHA1 have also provided important insights into a number of novel metalloenzymes and their biosynthesis, such as acetonitrile hydratase (ANHase), a cobalt-containing enzyme with no significant sequence identity with characterized nitrile hydratases. Molecular genetic and biochemical studies have identified AnhE as a dimeric metallochaperone that delivers cobalt to ANHase, enabling its maturation in vivo.

Recently, some of these compounds started to be exploited for the design of many types of therapeutic agents. Among the enzymes for which sulfamide-based inhibitors were designed, are the carbonic anhydrases (CAs), a large number of proteases belonging to the aspartic protease (HIV-1 protease, gamma-secretase), serine protease (elastase, chymase, tryptase, and thrombin among others), and metalloprotease (carboxypeptidase A (CPA) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)) families.

In all these compounds, many of which show low nanomolar affinity for the target enzymes for which they have been designed, the free or substituted sulfamide moiety plays important roles for the binding of the inhibitor to the active site cavity, either by directly coordinating to a metal ion found in some metalloenzymes (CAs, CPA, STS), usually by means of one of the nitrogen atoms present in the sulfamide motif, or as in the case of the cyclic sulfamides acting as HIV protease inhibitors, interacting with the catalytically critical aspartic acid residues of the active site by means of an oxygen atom belonging to the HN-SO2-NH motif, which substitutes a catalytically essential water molecule. In other cases, the sulfamide moiety is important for inducing desired physico-chemical properties to the drug-like compounds incorporating it, such as enhanced water solubility, better bioavailability, etc., because of the intrinsic properties of this highly polarized moiety when attached to an organic scaffold.

Rhodanese is the primary enzyme to execute metabolism of cyanide with minor pathways from other sulfurtransferases in vivo. The rhodanese enzyme depends on sulfur donor availability to metabolize cyanide and poisoning occurs at elevated cyanide concentrations in vivo. Cyanide interacts with over 40 metalloenzymes, but its lethal action is non-competitive inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase, halting cellular respiration and causing hypoxic anoxia. Only a handful of antidotes for treatment of cyanide poisoning are known; they are primarily inorganic compounds and metal complexes which are intended to intercept cyanide before it inhibits cellular respiration. The inorganic compounds manipulate hemoglobin, forming methemoglobin, or supply sulfur for the rhodanese enzyme. The metal complexes intercept the cyanide and bind it before reaching its target. Cobalt complexes of corrins and vitamin B12 derivatives are the state-of-the-art agents, while the longest employed complex, Co2EDTA, is designed to deliver ""free"" cobalt for binding of cyanide. Compounds that are in development are discussed from the point of how they are designed to intercept cyanide. The challenge of reversing the cyanide inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase is based on the catalytic active site structure and reactivity.

We then attempted to degrade RB19 using Escherichia coli expressing this mutant, but RB19 was degraded equally compared with bacteria expressing wild-type (WT) DyP because most DyP was expressed in a heme-free form. In this study, we attempted to design an artificial peroxidase based on cytochrome c (cyt c), whose heme is covalently bound to the protein.

To enhance the substrate binding affinity we introduced an additional Trp by replacing Pro76 (P76W). The catalytic efficiency of this mutant was ∼3-fold greater than that of WT cyt c. Finally, to form a hydrogen bond to axial histidine Gly29 was replaced with Asp (G29D). This mutant exhibited an ∼80-fold greater dye-decolorizing activity.

Discrimination between native and non-native metal site placements was further enhanced upon constrained energy minimization using the Rosetta energy function. Upon sequence design of the surrounding first-shell residues, we found further stabilization of native placements and a small but significant (1.7%) number of non-native placement-based sites with favorable Rosetta energies, indicating their designability in existing protein interfaces.

Steric and electronic effects of ligands provide organic chemists with an exceedingly useful tool. More than four decades ago, chemists began to think about a different approach, namely, embedding achiral ligand/metal moieties covalently or noncovalently in protein hosts with formation of artificial metalloenzymes. While structurally fascinating, this approach led in each case only to a single (bio)catalyst, with its selectivity and activity being a matter of chance. In order to solve this fundamental problem, my group proposed in 2000-2002 the idea of directed evolution of artificial metalloenzymes. In earlier studies, we had already demonstrated that directed evolution of enzymes constitutes a viable method for enhancing and inverting the stereoselectivity of enzymes as catalysts in organic chemistry. We speculated that it should also be possible to manipulate selectivity and activity of artificial metalloenzymes, which would provide organic chemists with a tool for optimizing essentially any transition metal catalyzed reaction type. In order to put this vision into practice, we first turned to the Whitesides system for artificial metalloenzyme formation, comprising a biotinylated diphosphine/Rh moiety, which is anchored noncovalently to avidin or streptavidin. Following intensive optimization, proof of principle was finally demonstrated in 2006, which opened the door to a new research area. This personal Account critically assesses these early studies as well as subsequent efforts from my group focusing on different protein scaffolds, and includes briefly some of the most important current contributions of other groups. Two primary messages emerge: First, since organic chemists continue to be extremely good at designing and implementing man-made transition metal catalysts, often on a large scale, those scientists that are active in the equally intriguing field of directed evolution of artificial metalloenzymes should be moderate when generalizing claims. All factors required for a truly viable catalytic system need to be considered, especially activity and ease of upscaling. Second, the most exciting and thus far very rare cases of directed evolution of artificial metalloenzymes are those that focus on selective transformations that are not readily possible using state of the art transition metal catalysts.",True,False,,"Catalysis, Coordination Complexeschemistry, Directed Molecular Evolutionmethods, Enzymeschemistrygenetics, Metalloproteinschemistrygenetics, Transition Elementschemistry"

Many different classes of CA inhibitors (CAIs) were reported in the last decade, with a wealth of inhibition mechanisms, where apart from the classical one, the inhibitors do not bind to the zinc ion from the active site. The zinc binders (sulfonamides, dithiocarbamates and their isosteres, thiols, selenols, carboxylates, hydroxamates, carbamates) are not isoform-selective inhibitors, but the specificity of action may be achieved by decorating their scaffolds with tails that interact with amino acids at the entrance of the active site. Areas covered: Herein, the authors review the advances in the structural annotation of human CAs. Furthermore, the authors look at the impact on drug discovery efforts as well as providing their expert perspectives. Expert opinion: CAs are a unique example among metalloenzymes for which all regions of their spacious active sites may be used for inhibitor/activator binding, leading to a variety of inhibition mechanisms and profiles for the many chemotypes modulating their activity.

One promising strategy to overcome this problem is through the use of ribozymes, a class of metalloenzymes made entirely of ribonucleic acid (RNA), that are capable of cleaving other RNA molecules in a catalytic fashion. Their activity can be targeted against specific mRNAs by selection of unique sequences flanking a conserved catalytic motif. In synthetic ribozymes, specificity, stability, and cell permeability can be dramatically improved by the incorporation of chemically modified ribonucleotides. This review focuses on the design and application of hammerhead ribozymes, the best-known and most widely used class of RNA-based enzymes. So far, except for a few conserved structures at the catalytic core, no one particular model or superior ribozyme design has been identified. It may well be that each cell, tissue, and organism has different requirements for the uptake, activity, and stability of hammerhead ribozymes. However, designed ribozymes can be highly effective agents for timed and localized elimination of gene products. As the 3D structures of active hammerhead molecules are revealed, more effective ribozymes will be developed. Today, developments in ribozyme-mediated sequence-specific blocking of gene expression hold great promise for active RNA enzymes as tools in biomolecular research and for eliminating unwanted gene expression in human diseases.",True,True,,"Animals, Drug Design, Enzyme Stability, Gene Expressiondrug effects, Gene Silencingdrug effects, Humans, Molecular Structure, Protein Conformation, Protein Engineering, RNA, Catalyticchemical synthesischemistrypharmacology, Substrate Specificity, Transfectionmethods"

To provide fundamental information for the study of the icaritin metabolism, the biotransformation of icariin by the human intestinal bacteria is reported for the first time. Together with human intestinal microflora, the three bacteria Streptococcus sp. MRG-ICA-B, Enterococcus sp. MRG-ICA-E, and Blautia sp.

The metabolites including icariside II, icaritin, and desmethylicaritin, but not icariside I, were produced. The MRG-ICA-B and E strains hydrolyzed only the glucose moiety of icariin, and icariside II was the only metabolite. However, the MRG-PMF-1 strain metabolized icariin further to desmethylicaritin via icariside II and icaritin. From the results, along with the icariin metabolism by human microflora, it was evident that most icariin is quickly transformed to icariside II before absorption in the human intestine.

All three polymer NHCs exhibited enhanced reactivity of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) during CO2 electroreduction by suppressing proton reduction. Notably, the incorporation of hydrophobic PS segments in both PS-NHC and PEO-b-PS-NHC led to a twofold increase in the partial current density for CO formation, as compared to the hydrophilic PEO-NHC. While polymer ligands did not hinder ion diffusion, their hydrophobicity altered the localized hydrogen bonding structures of water. This was confirmed experimentally and theoretically through attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation, demonstrating improved CO2 diffusion and subsequent reduction in the presence of hydrophobic polymers. Furthermore, NHCs exhibited reasonable stability under reductive conditions, preserving the structural integrity of AuNPs, unlike thiol-ended polymers.

Together these metalloenzymes consist of a major portion of the enzyme family and can catalyze some of the most difficult biological reactions. Designing these metalloenzymes can be both challenging and rewarding because it can provide deeper insights into the structure and function of proteins and cheaper and more stable alternatives for biochemical and biotechnological applications. Toward this goal, both rational and combinatorial approaches have been used. The rational approach is good for designing metalloenzymes that are well characterized, such as heme proteins, while the combinatorial approach is better at designing those whose structures are poorly understood, such as metallo-DNA/RNAzymes. Among the rational approaches, de novo design is at its best when metal-binding sites reside in a scaffold whose structure has been designed de novo (e.g., alpha-helical bundles). Otherwise, design using native scaffolds can be equally effective, allowing more choices of scaffolds whose structural stability is often more resistant to multiple mutations. In addition, computational and empirical designs have both enjoyed successes. Because of the limitation in defining structural parameters for metal-binding sites, a computational approach is restricted to mostly metal-binding sites that are well defined, such as mono- or homonuclear centers. An empirical approach, even though it is less restrictive in the metal-binding sites to be designed, depends heavily on one's knowledge and choice of templates and targets. An emerging approach is a combination of both computational and empirical approaches. The success of these approaches can be measured not only by three-dimensional structural comparison between the designed and target enzymes but also by the total amount of insight obtained from the design process and studies of the designed enzymes. One of the biggest advantages of designed metalloenzymes is the potential of placing two different metal-binding sites in the same protein framework for comparison. A final measure of success is how one can utilize the insight gained from the intellectual exercise to design new metalloenzymes, including those with unprecedented structures and functions. Future challenges include designing more complex metalloenzymes such as heteronuclear metal centers with strong nanomolar or better affinities. A key to meeting this challenge is to focus on the design of not only primary but also secondary coordination spheres using a combination of improved computer programs, experimental design, and high-resolution crystallography.",True,False,,"Amino Acid Sequence, Base Sequence, Binding Sites, Biomedical Engineeringmethodstrends, Catalysis, Computational Biology, DNAchemistrymetabolism, Drug Design, Enzyme Stability, Hemeproteinschemistrymetabolism, Metalloproteinschemistrymetabolism, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Oxidation-Reduction, RNAchemistrymetabolism"

Recent developments in drug discovery have highlighted the numerous biological and pharmacological properties that the hydroxamic acid function may possess, leading to therapeutic applications. These properties may be explained by its ability to chelate metals via the presence of two oxygen atoms. Their pharmacological activities can be divided into three groups. The first concerns the ability of these hydroxamic acid derivatives to scavenge metals (particularly iron), which leads to antioxidant, antimicrobial and metal detoxification activities. The latter is largely used to treat iron overload in patients. The second group of activities is related to their ability to inhibit metallo-enzymes, which gives them a wide range of pharmacological effects: antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antitumor. The third group is linked to the capacity of these compounds to generate nitric oxide, which confers hypotensive activity. However, hydroxamates exhibit relatively low stability in vivo, which can be overcome by the synthesis of appropriately designed analogs. For this purpose, many different strategies have been proposed. In this review, we compare and discuss the various synthetic pathways used to obtain the most complex of them, the N-substituted hydroxamic acids.

The initial presence of accessible Ce3+ sites in the as-synthesized UiO-66(Ce) has been determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)-CO analyses. Moreover, linear scan voltammetric measurements reveal a reversible Ce4+/Ce3+ interconversion within the UiO-66(Ce) material, while nanocrystalline ceria shows an irreversible voltammetric response. This suggests that terephthalic acid ligands facilitate charge transfer between subnanometric metallic nodes, explaining the higher oxidase-like activity of UiO-66(Ce) compared to nanoceria for the mild oxidation of organic dyes under aerobic conditions. Based on these results, we propose the use of Ce-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as efficient catalysts for the halogenation of activated arenes, as 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (TMB), using oxygen as a green oxidant. Kinetic studies demonstrate that UiO-66(Ce) is at least three times more active than nanoceria under the same reaction conditions.

Finally, a general mechanism for the oxidative halogenation reaction is proposed when using Ce-MOF as a catalyst, which mimics the mechanistic pathway described for metalloenzymes.

Comparing homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase and gentisate dioxygenase highlights the significance of charge maintenance after substrate binding as an important factor that drives the reaction coordinate. We then extend the charge analysis to several common types of nonheme iron oxygenases containing either a 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad or a 3-His or 4-His ligand motif, including extradiol and intradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenases, thiol dioxygenases, α-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases, and carotenoid cleavage oxygenases. After forming the productive enzyme-substrate complex, the overall charge of the iron complex at the 0, +1, or +2 state is maintained in the remaining catalytic steps. Hence, maintaining a constant charge is crucial to promote the reaction of the iron center beginning from the formation of the Michaelis or ternary complex. The charge compensation to the iron ion is tuned not only by protein-derived carboxylate ligands but also by substrates. Overall, these analyses indicate that charge maintenance at the iron center is significant when all the necessary components form a productive complex. This charge maintenance concept may apply to most oxygen-activating metalloenzymes systems that do not draw electrons and protons step-by-step from a separate reactant, such as NADH, via a reductase. The charge maintenance perception may also be useful in proposing catalytic pathways or designing prototypical reactions using artificial or engineered enzymes for biotechnological applications.",True,False,,

The zinc ion (Zn2+), which is a necessary metal ion in the human body, plays a very important role in the regulation of gene transcription and metalloenzyme function. The imbalance of Zn2+ homeostasis is also associated with a variety of neurological diseases. Therefore, it is critically important to accurately image the steady-state changes of Zn2+ in vivo. However, no PA imaging method is currently available for Zn2+. To this end, we designed and synthesized the first PA probe of Zn2+, namely, CR-1 for in situ ratiometric imaging of Zn2+ in deep tissue in vivo. The CR-1molecule, combined with Zn2+, weakened the conjugation system of the π-electron in the CR-1 molecule, which resulted in the blue shift of its absorption peak from 710 nm to 532 nm.

Intervention in cellular metal distribution with small-molecule or peptide chelating agents has promising therapeutic potential to harness metals to fight disease. Molecular outcomes associated with forming metal-chelate interactions in situ include altering the concentration and subcellular metal distribution, inhibiting metalloenzymes, enhancing the reactivity of a metal species to elicit a favorable biological response, or passivating the reactivity of a metal species to prevent deleterious reactivity. The systemic administration of metal chelating agents, however, raises safety concerns due to the potential risks of indiscriminate extraction of metals from critical metalloproteins and inhibition of metalloenzymes. One can estimate that chelators capable of complexing metal ions with dissociation constants in the submicromolar range are thermodynamically capable of extracting metal ions from some metalloproteins and disrupting regular function. Such dissociation constants are easily attainable for multidentate chelators interacting with first-row d-block metal cations in relevant +1, + 2, and +3 oxidation states. To overcome this challenge of indiscriminate metal chelation, we have pursued a prodrug strategy for chelating agents in which the resulting ""prochelator"" has negligible metal binding affinity until a specific stimulus generates a favorable metal binding site. The prochelator strategy enables conditional metal chelation to occur preferentially in locations affected by disease- or therapy-associated stimuli, thereby minimizing off-target metal chelation. Our design of responsive prochelators encompasses three general approaches of activation: the ""removal"" approach operates by eliminating a masking group that blocks a potential metal chelation site to reveal the complete binding site under the desired conditions; the molecular ""switch"" approach involves a reversible conformational change between inactive and active forms of a chelator with differential metal binding affinity under specific conditions; and the ""addition"" approach adds a new ligand donor arm to the prochelator to constitute a complete metal chelation site. Adopting these approaches, we have created four categories of triggerable prochelators that respond to (1) reactive oxygen species, (2) light, (3) specific enzymes, and (4) biological regulatory events. This Account highlights progress from our group on building prochelators that showcase these four categories of responsive metal chelating agents for manipulating cellular metals. The creation and chemical understanding of such stimulus-responsive prochelators enables exciting applications for understanding the cell biology of metals and for developing therapies based on metal-dependent processes in a variety of diseases.",True,False,,"Animals, Cell Line, Chelating Agentschemistrymetabolismradiation effects, Humans, Hydroxyquinolineschemistry, Light, Metalschemistry, Mice, Peptideschemistrymetabolism, Prodrugschemistrymetabolismradiation effects, Rats, Reactive Oxygen Specieschemistry"

We have reported that Fab fragments labeled with 3'-[131I]iodohippuryl Nepsilon-maleoyl-lysine (HML) showed markedly low renal radioactivity levels even shortly after injection, due to a rapid and selective release of m-[131I]iodohippuric acid by the action of brush border enzymes. To estimate the applicability of the molecular design to metallic radionuclides, [188Re]tricarbonyl(cyclopentadienylcarbonate)rhenium ([188Re]CpTR-COOH) was conjugated with Nepsilon-tert-butoxycarbonyl-glycyl-lysine or Nepsilon-maleoyl-glycyl-lysine to prepare [188Re]CpTR-GK-Boc or [188Re]CpTR-GK. The cleavage of the glycyl-lysine linkage of the two compounds generates a glycine conjugate of [188Re]CpTR-COOH ([188Re]CpTR-Gly), which possesses in vivo behaviors similar to those of m-iodohippuric acid. The hydrolysis rate of the peptide bond in [188Re]CpTR-GK-Boc was compared with that in 3'-[125I]iodohippuryl Nepsilon-Boc-lysine ([125I]HL-Boc) using brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) prepared from rat kidneys. [188Re]CpTR-GK was conjugated to thiolated Fab fragments to prepare [188Re]CpTR-GK-Fab. The biodistribution of radioactivity after injection of [188Re]CpTR-GK-Fab was compared with that of [125I]HML-Fab and [188Re]CpTR-Fab prepared by conjugating N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester of [188Re]CpTR-COOH with antibody fragments. While [188Re]CpTR-GK-Boc liberated [188Re]CpTR-Gly in BBMVs, [125I]HL-Boc liberated m-[125I]iodohippuric acid at a much faster rate. In addition, although [125I]HL-Boc was hydrolyzed by both metalloenzymes and nonmetalloenzymes, metalloenzymes were responsible for the cleavage of the peptide linkage in [188Re]CpTR-GK-Boc. In biodistribution studies, [188Re]CpTR-GK-Fab exhibited significantly lower renal radioactivity levels than did [188Re]CpTR-Fab. However, the renal radioactivity levels of [188Re]CpTR-GK-Fab were slightly higher than those of [125I]HML-Fab. The analysis of urine samples collected for 6 h postinjection of [188Re]CpTR-GK-Fab showed that [188Re]CpTR-Gly was the major radiometabolite. In tumor-bearing mice, [188Re]CpTR-GK-Fab significantly reduced renal radioactivity levels without impairing the radioactivity levels in tumor. These findings indicate that the molecular design of HML can be applied to metallic radionuclides by using a radiometal chelate of high inertness and by designing a radiometabolite of high urinary excretion when released from antibody fragments following cleavage of a glycyl-lysine linkage. This study also indicates that a change in chemical structure of a radiolabel attached to a glycyl-lysine linkage significantly affected enzymes involved in the hydrolysis reaction. Since there are many kinds of enzymes that cleave a variety of peptide linkages on the renal brush border membrane, selection of a peptide linkage optimal to a radiometal chelate of interest may provide radiolabeled antibody fragments that exhibit renal radioactivity levels similar to those of [131I]HML-labeled ones.

Understanding how much, or how little, of a protein's often complicated structure is necessary for its function can lead to directed therapeutic strategies and would allow one to design proteins for specific desired functions. Studying protein function by de novo design builds the functionality from the ground up in a completely unrelated and noncoded protein scaffold. Our lab has used this strategy to study heavy and transition metal binding within the TRI family of three stranded coiled coil (3SCC) constructs to understand coordination geometry and metalloenzyme catalytic control within a protein environment. These peptides contain hydrophobic layers within the interior of the 3SCC, which one can mutate to metal binding residues to create a minimal metal binding site, while solid phase synthesis allows our lab to easily incorporate a number of noncoded amino acids including d enantiomers of binding or secondary coordination sphere amino acids, penicillamine, or methylated versions of histidine. Our studies of Cd(II) binding to Cys3 environments have determined, largely through the use of 113Cd NMR and 111mCd PAC, that the coordination environment around a heavy metal can be controlled by incorporating noncoded amino acids in either the primary or secondary coordination spheres. We found mutating the metal binding amino acids to l-Pen can enforce trigonal Cd(II)S3 geometry exclusively compared to the mixed coordination determined for l-Cys coordination. The same result can be achieved with secondary sphere mutations as well by incorporating d-Leu above a Cys3. We hypothesize this latter effect is due to the increased steric packing above the metal binding site that occurs when the l-Leu oriented toward the N-terminus of the scaffold is mutated to d-Leu and oriented toward the C-terminus. Mutating the layer below Cys3 to d-Leu instead formed a mixed 4- and 5-coordinate Cd(II)S3(H2O) and Cd(II)S3(H2O)2 construct as steric bulk was decreased below the metal binding site. We have also applied noncoded amino acids to metalloenzyme systems by incorporating His residues that are methylated at the δ- or ε-nitrogen to enforce Cu(I) ligation to the opposite open nitrogen of His and found a 2 orders of magnitude increased catalytic efficiency for nitrite reductase activity with ε-nitrogen coordination compared to δ-nitrogen. These results exemplify the ability to tune coordination environment and catalytic efficiency within a de novo scaffold as well as the utility of noncoded amino acids to increase the chemist's toolbox. By furthering our understanding of metalloprotein design one could envision, through our use of amino acids not normally available to nature, that protein design laboratories will soon be capable of outperforming the native systems previously used as their benchmark of successful design.

Designing artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) to catalyze abiological reactions has been a major endeavor for many years, but most ArM activities are far below those of native enzymes, making them unsuitable for most pratical applications. A critical step to advance the field is to fundamentally understand what it takes to not only confer but also fine-tune ArM activities so they match those of native enzymes. Indeed, only once we can freely modulate ArM activity to rival (or surpass!) natural enzymes can the potential of ArMs be fully realized. A key to unlocking ArM potential is the observation that one metal primary coordination sphere can display a range of functions and levels of activity, leading to the realization that secondary coordination sphere (SCS) interactions are critically important. However, SCS interactions are numerous, long-range, and weak, making them very difficult to reproduce in ArMs. Furthermore, natural enzymes are tied to a small set of biologically available functional moieties from canonical amino acids and physiologically available metal ions and metallocofactors, severely limiting the chemical space available to probe and tune ArMs. In this Account, we summarize the use of unnatural amino acids (UAAs) and non-native metal ions and metallocofactors by our group and our collaborators to probe and modulate ArM functions. We incorporated isostructural UAAs in a type 1 copper (T1Cu) protein azurin to provide conclusive evidence that axial ligand hydrophobicity is a major determinant of T1Cu redunction potential ( E°'). Closely related work from other groups are also discussed. We also probed the role of protein backbone interactions that cannot be altered by standard mutagenesis by replacing the peptide bond with an ester linkage. We used insight gained from these studies to tune the E°' of azurin across the entire physiological range, the broadest range ever achieved in a single metalloprotein. Introducing UAA analogues of Tyr into ArM models of heme-copper oxidase (HCO) revealed a linear relationship between p Ka, E°', and activity. We also substituted non-native hemes and non-native metal ions for their native equivalents in these models to resolve several issues that were intractable in native HCOs and the closely related nitric oxide reductases, such as their roles in modulating substrate affinity, electron transfer rate, and activity. We incorporated abiological cofactors such as ferrocene and Mn(salen) into azurin and myoglobin, respectively, to stabilize these inorganic and organometallic compounds in water, confer abiological functions, tune their E°' and activity through SCS interactions, and show that the approach to metallocofactor anchoring and orientation can tune enantioselectivity and alter function.

Previous designs of due ferro (DF) proteins have resulted in tetrameric and dimeric four-helix bundles having crystallographically well-defined structures and active-site geometries. Here, the design and characterization of DFsc, a 114 residue monomeric four-helix bundle, is presented. The backbone was modeled using previous oligomeric structures and appropriate inter-helical turns. The identities of 26 residues were predetermined, including the primary and secondary ligands in the active site, residues involved in active site accessibility, and the gamma beta gamma beta turn between helices 2 and 3. The remaining 88 amino acid residues were determined using statistical computer aided design, which is based upon a recent statistical theory of protein sequences. Rather than sampling sequences, the theory directly provides the site-specific amino acid probabilities, which are then used to guide sequence design. The resulting sequence (DFsc) expresses well in Escherichia coli and is highly soluble. Sedimentation studies confirm that the protein is monomeric in solution. Circular dichroism spectra are consistent with the helical content of the target structure. The protein is structured in both the apo and the holo forms, with the metal-bound form exhibiting increased stability. DFsc stoichiometrically binds a variety of divalent metal ions, including Zn(II), Co(II), Fe(II), and Mn(II), with micromolar affinities. 15N HSQC NMR spectra of both the apo and Zn(II) proteins reveal excellent dispersion with evidence of a significant structural change upon metal binding.

Here we present the structures and catalytic activity of novel copper ArMs capable of (R)- or (S)-stereoselective control, utilizing a steroid carrier protein (SCP) scaffold. To incorporate 2,2'-bipyridine (Bpy) into SCP, two distinct strategies were employed: either Bpy was introduced as an unnatural amino acid (2,2'-bipyridin-5-yl)alanine (BpyAla) using amber stop codon expression or via bioconjugation of bromomethyl-Bpy to cysteine residues. The resulting ArMs proved to be effective at catalysing an enantioselective Friedel-Crafts reaction with SCP_Q111BpyAla achieving the best selectivity with an enantioselectivity of 72% ee (S). Interestingly, despite using the same protein scaffold, different attachment strategies for Bpy at the same residue (Q111) led to a switch in the enantiopreference of the ArM. X-ray crystal structures of SCP_Q111CBpy and SCP_Q111BpyAla ArMs with bound Cu(ii) ions unveiled crucial differences in the orientation of the catalytic centre. Combining structural information, alanine scanning studies, and computational analysis shed light on the distinct active sites of the ArMs, clarifying that these active sites stabilise the nucleophilic substrate on different sides of the electrophile leading to the observed switch in enantioselectivity.

In nature, metalloenzymes catalyze a wide range of oxidation reactions by activating dioxygen under mild conditions. Inspired by selective and efficient oxidation reactions catalyzed by metalloenzymes, researchers have developed a number of synthetic model compounds that mimic the functionality of metalloenzymes. Among the reported biomimetic model compounds, tetradentate aminopyridine (N4) ligands have emerged as appealing frameworks because of their easy synthesis and facile diversification, and their complexes with metals such as Fe and Mn have proven to be versatile and powerful catalysts for a variety of (enantioselective) oxidation reactions. In this Account, we describe our efforts on the design of chiral N4 ligands and the use of their manganese and iron complexes in asymmetric oxidation reactions with H2O2 as the terminal oxidant, aiming to show general strategies for asymmetric oxidation reactions that can guide the rational design of ligands and relevant metal catalysts. In studies of manganese catalysts, the aryl-substituted (R,R)-mcp [mcp = N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-bis(pyridine-2-ylmethyl)cyclohexane-1,2-diamine] manganese complexes exhibited high enantioselectivity in the asymmetric epoxidation (AE) of various olefins with H2O2 while requiring stoichiometric acetic acid as an additive for the activation of H2O2. To address this issue, we established bulkier N4 ligands for this catalytic system in which a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid enables the manganese-complex-catalyzed AE with improved stereocontrol and efficiency. In addition, this system was found to be active for the oxidative kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols. Further exploration of the structure-reactivity relationships has shown that aminobenzimidazole N4 ligands derived from l-proline, in which the conventional pyridine donors are replaced by benzimidazoles, act as promising ligands. These novel C1-symmetric manganese catalysts showed dramatically improved activities with unprecedented turnover numbers in the AE reactions. Notably, this class of manganese complexes can catalyze the oxidation of the C-H bonds of spirocyclic hydrocarbons and spiroazacyclic compounds in a highly enantioselective manner, providing ready access to chiral spirocyclic β,β'-diketones and spirocyclic alcohols. Remarkably, iron catalysts with these chiral N4 ligands are effective for AE of olefins, enabling rare examples of highly enantioselective syntheses of epoxides by the iron catalysts. Finally, mechanistic studies provide valuable insights into the roles of the carboxylic acid and sulfuric acid in the catalytic oxidation reactions. Thus, the results described in this Account have demonstrated the importance of tunability and compatibility of the ligands for the development of efficient oxidation catalysts with earth-abundant transition metals and environmentally benign oxidants, and we hope that our study will pave the way for the discovery of efficient oxidation catalysis.",True,False,,

However, the activity of the SADH oxidation reaction is generally low, making it unsuitable for large-scale production. In this study, a rational design approach was employed to computationally engineer SADH derived from Ogataea parapolymorpha (OpSADH), significantly enhancing its oxidation activity towards (R)-1,2-propanediol (PDO). The mutant M2 (S222T/S316A) exhibited a 14.2-fold increase in specific enzyme activity compared to the wild type (WT) and was employed as a catalyst for high-concentration hydroxyacetone production, facilitated by an NAD+ regeneration system. By applying an appropriate Zn2+ ion force field in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it was found that two mutation sites could stabilize the conformations of NAD+ and PDO, thereby revealing the molecular mechanism behind the enhanced activity of this metalloenzyme mutant. Notably, we first uncovered the dynamic mechanism by which four key residues (Cys39, His75, Glu76, and Glu175) and PDO within the active pocket contribute to the formation of coordination bonds with Zn2+.

In this work, the mechanism of enantioselective reduction of imine catalyzed by using [Rh(Me4Cpbiot)Cl2]·S112H Sav (denoted as S112H) and [Rh(Me4Cpbiot)Cl2]·K121H Sav (denoted as K121H) was studied by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Four binding modes of imine, two proton sources (hydronium ion and lysine) and eight proposed reaction pathways were systematically discussed. The results showed that due to the anchoring effect of the mutation site of ArMs, the rhodium complex which oscillated like a pendulum was bound to a specific conformation, which further determined the chirality of the reduced product. C-Hπ, cation-π and ππ weak interactions played an important role in imine binding, and the favorable binding mode of imine was catalyzed by S112H in landscape orientation and catalyzed by K121H in portrait orientation, respectively. LYS121 is the most possible proton source in the S112H catalytic process while the proton source in the K121H catalytic process is the hydronium ion of the active sites. Furthermore, based on the reaction mechanism, modification of Rh(Me4Cpbiot)Cl2 was carried out in S112H and K121H, and the results suggested that the reaction barrier could be effectively reduced by replacing the methyl groups on Cp* with an amino group.

Despite its significance, a fundamental understanding of this transformation is lacking, hampering efforts to harness analogous chemistry. To address these knowledge gaps, we have designed an artificial metalloenzyme within the azurin protein scaffold as a structural, functional, and mechanistic model of ACS.

Moreover, we demonstrate that the nickel-acetyl species is chemically competent for selective acyl transfer upon thiol addition to biosynthesize an activated thioester. Drawing an analogy to the native enzyme, a mechanism for thioester generation by this ACS model has been proposed. The fundamental insight into the enzymatic process provided by this rudimentary ACS model has implications for the evolution of primitive ACS-like proteins.

However, their peroxidase-like activity is not satisfactory. Due to the high programmability and good stability of DNA, DNA as a scaffold material is promising for enhancing the activity of artificial metalloenzymes. In this work, an effective DNA nanotube-based peroxidase was constructed using a self-assembly strategy. To improve the activity of G-quadruplex/heme complexes, a new method for the construction of G-quadruplex/heme complex arrays was proposed in a simple and inexpensive way. By designing the toes of DNA nanotubes as G-quadruplexes, G-quadruplex arrays could be formed on pure DNA nanotubes, and then the G-quadruplex arrays bind to heme to form a nanotube-supported DNAzyme termed as DNTzyme. Agarose gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism, and fluorescence microscopy were used to characterize DNTzyme.

The design principles of such cooperativity in metalloenzymes are underexplored, but are critical to understand for developing efficient catalysts designed with earth abundant metals for small molecule activation. The simple substrate requirements of reversible proton reduction by the [NiFe]-hydrogenases make them a model bioinorganic system. A highly conserved arginine residue (R355) directly above the exogenous ligand binding position of the [NiFe]-catalytic core is known to be essential for optimal function because mutation to a lysine results in lower catalytic rates. To expand on our studies of soluble hydrogenase-1 from Pyrococcus furiosus (Pf SH1), we investigated the role of R355 by site-directed-mutagenesis to a lysine (R355K) using infrared and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic probes sensitive to active site redox and protonation events.

The presence and/or position of a single methyl substituent drastically alters inhibitor potency and can result in coordination modes not observed in small-molecule model complexes.

Protein expression levels, spatial localization, and structural differences directly affect pharmacodynamics. To date, >20000 proteins have been discovered in the human proteome by the genome and proteome projects via gene and protein sequencing. Understanding the biological functions of proteins is critical in identifying and regulating biological processes, with most remaining unidentified. Until recently, >85% of proteins were considered undruggable, mainly because of the lack of binding pockets and active sites targeted by small molecules. Therefore, characterization of the reactive sites of amino acids based on proteomic hierarchy is the key to novel drug design. Recently, with the rapid development of mass spectrometry (MS), the study of drug-target protein interactions based on proteomics technology has been considerably promoted. Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) is an active chemical probe-based method of detecting functional enzymes and drug targets in complex samples. Compared with classical proteomics strategies, ABPP is based mainly on protein activity. It has been successfully utilized to characterize the activities of numerous protease families with crucial biological functions, such as serine hydrolases, protein kinases, glycosidases, and metalloenzymes. It has also been used to identify key enzymes that are closely related to diseases and develop covalent inhibitors for use in disease treatment. The technology used in proteome analysis ranges from gel electrophoresis to high-throughput MS due to the progress of MS technology. ABPP strategies combined with chemical probe labeling and quantitative MS enable the characterization of amino acid activity, which may enhance the discovery of novel drug targets and the development of lead compounds. Amino acid residues play critical roles in protein structures and functions, and covalent drugs targeting these amino acids are effective in treating numerous diseases. There are 20 main types of natural amino acids, with different reactivities, in the proteins in the human body. In addition, the proteins and amino acids are affected by the spatial microenvironment, leading to significant differences in their spatial reactivities. The key in evaluating the reactivities of amino acids via ABPP is to select those with high reactivities. The core of the ABPP strategy is the use of chemical probes to label amino acid sites that exhibit higher activities in certain environments. The activity-based probe (ABP) at the core of ABPP consists of three components: reactive, reporter groups and a linker. The reactive group is the basis of the ABP and anchors the drug target via strong forces, such as covalent bonds. The reaction exhibits a high specificity and conversion rate and should display a good biocompatibility. Activity probes based on different amino acid residues have been developed, and the screening of amino acid activity combined with isotope labeling is a new focus of research. Currently, different types of ABPs have been developed to target amino acids and characterize amino acid reactivity, such as cysteine labeled with an electrophilic iodoacetamide probe and lysine labeled with activated esters. ABPP facilitates the discovery of potentially therapeutic protein targets, the screening of lead compounds, and the identification of drug targets, thus aiding the design of novel drugs. This review focuses on the development of ABPP methods and the progress in the screening of amino acid reactivity using ABPs, which should be promising methods for use in designing targeted drugs with covalent interactions.",True,True,,"Humans, Amino Acids, Proteomicsmethods, Proteomeanalysis, Cysteine, Lysine"

Artificial systems for homogeneous photocatalytic WO are based on small molecules that often have limited solubility in aqueous solutions. In this work, we alleviated this issue and present a cobalt-based WO-catalyst containing artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) that is active in light-driven, homogeneous WO catalysis in neutral-pH aqueous solutions. A haem-containing electron transfer protein, cytochrome B5 (CB5), served to host a first-row transition-metal-based WO catalyst, CoSalen (CoIISalen, where H2Salen = N,N'-bis(salicylidene)ethylenediamine), thus producing an ArM capable of driving photocatalytic WO. The CoSalen ArM formed a water-soluble pre-catalyst in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3](ClO4)2 as photosensitizer and Na2S2O8 as the sacrificial electron acceptor, with photocatalytic activity similar to that of free CoSalen. During photocatalysis, the CoSalen-protein interactions were destabilized, and the protein partially unfolded. Rather than forming tens of nanometer sized CoOx nanoparticles as free CoSalen does under photocatalytic WO conditions, the CB5 : CoSalen ArM showed limited protein cross-linking and remained soluble. We conclude that a weak, dynamic interaction between a soluble cobalt species and apoCB5 was formed, which generated a catalytically active adduct during photocatalysis.

Molecular simulations can aid drug discovery, for example, predicting inhibitor complexes, but empirical molecular mechanics (MM) methods often perform poorly for metalloproteins. Here we present a multiscale approach to model thiol inhibitor binding to IMP-1, a clinically important MBL containing two catalytic zinc ions, and predict the binding mode of a 2-mercaptomethyl thiazolidine (MMTZ) inhibitor. Inhibitors were first docked into the IMP-1 active site, testing different docking programs and scoring functions on multiple crystal structures. Complexes were then subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and subsequently refined through QM/MM optimization with a density functional theory (DFT) method, B3LYP/6-31G(d), increasing the accuracy of the method with successive steps. This workflow was tested on two IMP-1:MMTZ complexes, for which it reproduced crystallographically observed binding, and applied to predict the binding mode of a third MMTZ inhibitor for which a complex structure was crystallographically intractable. We also tested a 12-6-4 nonbonded interaction model in MD simulations and optimization with a SCC-DFTB QM/MM approach. The results show the limitations of empirical models for treating these systems and indicate the need for higher level calculations, for example, DFT/MM, for reliable structural predictions.

Up to now, only one effective inhibitor-acetohydroxamic acid (AHA)-is clinically available, but it has adverse side effects.

Among their therapeutic applications, they have gained significant attention as carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors, owing to their potential in the treatment of various diseases such as epilepsy, cancer and glaucoma. CA is a widely distributed zinc metalloenzyme that facilitates the reversible interconversion of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate. This reaction is essential for numerous physiological and pathological processes. In humans, CA exists in sixteen different isoforms, labeled hCA-I to hCA-XV, each distributed across various tissues and organs and involved in crucial physiological functions. Clinically utilized CA inhibitors, such as brinzolamide, dorzolamide and acetazolamide, exhibit poor selectivity, leading to undesirable side effects. A significant challenge in designing effective CA inhibitors is achieving balanced isoform selectivity, prompting the exploration of new chemotypes. This review compiles recent strategies employed by various researchers in developing CAIs across different structural classes, including pyrazoline, quinoline, imidazole, oxadiazole, pyrimidine, coumarin, chalcone, rhodanine, phthalazine, triazole, isatin, and indole. Additionally, the review summarizes structure-activity relationship (SAR) analyses, isoform selectivity evaluations, along with mechanistic and in silico investigations. Insights derived from SAR studies provide crucial directions for the rational design of next-generation heterocyclic CA inhibitors, with improved therapeutic efficacy and reduced side effects.

Inspired by the finely tuned redox management of these bioinorganic systems, we present the design, synthesis, and experimental and theoretical characterization of a homologous series of cobalt complexes bearing redox-active pyrazines. These donor moieties are locked into key positions within a pentadentate ligand scaffold in order to evaluate the effects of positioning redox non-innocent ligands on hydrogen evolution catalysis. Both metal- and ligand-centered redox features are observed in organic as well as aqueous solutions over a range of pH values, and comparison with analogs bearing redox-inactive zinc(ii) allows for assignments of ligand-based redox events. Varying the geometric placement of redox non-innocent pyrazine donors on isostructural pentadentate ligand platforms results in marked effects on observed cobalt-catalyzed proton reduction activity. Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution from weak acids in acetonitrile solution, under diffusion-limited conditions, reveals that the pyrazine donor of axial isomer 1-Co behaves as an unproductive electron sink, resulting in high overpotentials for proton reduction, whereas the equatorial pyrazine isomer complex 2-Co is significantly more active for hydrogen generation at lower voltages. Addition of a second equatorial pyrazine in complex 3-Co further minimizes overpotentials required for catalysis. The equatorial derivative 2-Co is also superior to its axial 1-Co congener for electrocatalytic and visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen generation in biologically relevant, neutral pH aqueous media. Density functional theory calculations (B3LYP-D2) indicate that the first reduction of catalyst isomers 1-Co, 2-Co, and 3-Co is largely metal-centered while the second reduction occurs at pyrazine. Taken together, the data establish that proper positioning of non-innocent pyrazine ligands on a single cobalt center is indeed critical for promoting efficient hydrogen catalysis in aqueous media, akin to optimally positioned redox-active cofactors in metalloenzymes. In a broader sense, these findings highlight the significance of electronic structure considerations in the design of effective electron-hole reservoirs for multielectron transformations.",True,False,,

This is achieved by substituting the native iron porphyrin cofactor with a heme analogue that possesses the desired properties. Replacing the iron center of the porphyrin with another metal provides one inroad to novel protein function. A less explored approach is substitution of the porphyrin cofactor with an alternative tetrapyrrole macrocycle or a related ligand. In general, these ligands exhibit chemical properties and reactivity that are distinct from those of porphyrins. While these techniques have most prominently been utilized to develop artificial metalloenzymes, there are many other applications of this methodology to problems in biochemistry, health, and medicine. Incorporation of synthetic cofactors into protein environments represents a facile way to impart water solubility and biocompatibility. It circumvents the laborious synthesis of water-soluble cofactors, which often introduces substantial charge that leads to undesired bioaccumulation. To this end, the incorporation of unnatural cofactors in heme proteins has enabled the development of designer proteins as optical oxygen sensors, MRI contrast agents, spectroscopic probes, tools to interrogate protein function, antibiotics, and fluorescent proteins.Incorporation of an artificial cofactor is frequently accomplished by denaturing the holoprotein with removal of the heme; the refolded apoprotein is then reconstituted with the artificial cofactor. This process often results in substantial protein loss and does not necessarily guarantee that the refolded protein adopts the native structure. To circumvent these issues, our laboratory has pioneered the use of the RP523 strain of E. coli to incorporate artificial cofactors into heme proteins using expression-based methods. This strain lacks the ability to biosynthesize heme, and the bacterial cell wall is permeable to heme and related molecules. In this way, heme analogues supplemented in the growth medium are incorporated into heme proteins. This approach can also be leveraged for the direct expression of the apoprotein for subsequent reconstitution.These methodologies have been exploited to incorporate non-native cofactors into heme proteins that are resistant to harsh environmental conditions: the heme nitric oxide/oxygen binding protein (H-NOX) from Caldanaerobacter subterraneus (Cs) and the heme acquisition system protein A (HasA) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). The exceptional stability of these proteins makes them ideal scaffolds for biomedical applications. Optical oxygen sensing has been accomplished using a phosphorescent ruthenium porphyrin as the artificial heme cofactor. Paramagnetic manganese and gadolinium porphyrins yield high-relaxivity, protein-based MRI contrast agents. A fluorescent phosphorus corrole serves as a heme analogue to produce fluorescent proteins. Iron complexes of nonporphyrin cofactors bound to HasA inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, HasA can deliver a gallium phthalocyanine into the bacterial cytosol to serve as a sensitizer for photochemical sterilization. Together, these examples illustrate the potential for designer heme proteins to address burgeoning problems in the areas of health and medicine. The concepts and methodologies presented in this Account can be extended to the development of next-generation biomedical sensing and imaging agents to identify and quantify clinically relevant metabolites and other key disease biomarkers.",True,False,,"Escherichia coli, Heme, Hemeproteins, Metalloproteins, Metals"

In this light, we carried out molecular docking to predict the binding modes of anti-influenza diketo acid inhibitors in the active site of the PAN subunit of the metalloenzyme RNA polymerase of influenza virus. The calculations suggested that the dianionic forms of the diketo acids should chelate the dinuclear manganese center as dinucleating ligands and sequester it.

These assumptions could adequately explain the enzyme inhibition by these compounds.

Now there are examples of designed metalloproteins that, although not yet reaching the activity of native enzymes, are considerably closer.

Each of these statements is amplified in cases where the transition metal catalyst controls the selectivity of a chemical reaction. Enantioselective catalysis is a challenging but well-established phenomenon, and regio- or site-selective catalysis is increasingly common. On the other hand, transition-metal-catalyzed reactions are typically conducted under highly optimized conditions. Rigorous exclusion of air and water is common, and it is taken for granted that only a single substrate (of a particular class) will be present in a reaction, a desired site selectivity can be achieved by installing a directing group, and undesired reactivity can be blocked with protecting groups. These are all reasonable synthetic strategies, but they also highlight limits to catalyst control. The utility of transition metal catalysis could be greatly expanded if catalysts possessed the ability to regulate which molecules they encounter and the relative orientation of those molecules. The rapid and widespread adoption of stoichiometric bioorthogonal reactions illustrates the utility of robust reactions that proceed with high selectivity and specificity under mild reaction conditions. Expanding this capability beyond preprogrammed substrate pairs via catalyst control could therefore have an enormous impact on molecular science. Many metalloenzymes exhibit this level of catalyst control, and directed evolution can be used to rapidly improve the catalytic properties of these systems. On the other hand, the range of reactions catalyzed by enzymes is limited relative to that developed by chemists. The possibility of imparting enzyme-like activity, selectivity, and evolvability to reactions catalyzed by synthetic transition metal complexes has inspired the creation of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs). The increasing levels of catalyst control exhibited by ArMs developed to date suggest that these systems could constitute a powerful platform for bioorthogonal transition metal catalysis and for selective catalysis in general. This Account outlines the development of a new class of ArMs based on a prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) scaffold. Studies conducted on POP ArMs containing a covalently linked dirhodium cofactor have shown that POP can impart enantioselectivity to a range of dirhodium-catalyzed reactions, increase reaction rates, and improve the specificity for reaction of dirhodium carbene intermediates with targeted organic substrates over components of cell lysate, including bulk water. Several design features of these ArMs enabled their evolution via random mutagenesis, which revealed that mutations throughout the POP scaffold, beyond the second sphere of the dirhodium cofactor, were important for ArM activity and selectivity. While it was anticipated that the POP scaffold would be capable of encapsulating and thus controlling the selectivity of bulky cofactors, molecular dynamics studies also suggest that POP conformational dynamics plays a role in its unique efficacy. These advances in scaffold selection, bioconjugation, and evolution form the basis of our ongoing efforts to control transition metal reactivity using protein scaffolds with the goal of enabling unique synthetic capabilities, including bioorthogonal catalysis.",True,False,,"Catalysis, Metalloproteinschemistrygenetics, Mutation, Prolyl Oligopeptidases, Protein Engineering, Pyrococcusenzymology, Rhodiumchemistry, Serine Endopeptidaseschemistrygenetics"

An in situ soft template reduction strategy is developed to deposit well-dispersed and exposed MnO2 in the mesochannels of OMUiO-66(Ce). Several synthesis parameters are optimized to minimize the particle size to ≈150 nm for efficient intracellular endocytosis. The mesochannels provide interaction guidance that not only rapidly drove H2 O2 substrates to CAT-like catalytic centers, but also seamlessly transfer H2 O2 intermediates between superoxide dismutase-like and CAT-like biocatalytic cascades.

The success of the design of these composites is highly dependent on an atomic understanding of the recognition process between inorganic and biological entities. Despite facing several challenging complexities, molecular modelling techniques could be particularly useful in providing such knowledge. This study aims to discuss how the prediction of the structural and energetic properties of the host-cofactor interactions can be performed by computational means. To do so, we designed a protocol that combines several methodologies like protein-ligand dockings and QM/MM techniques. The overall approach considers fundamental bioinorganic questions like the participation of the amino acids of the receptor to the first coordination sphere of the metal, the impact of the receptor/cofactor flexibility on the structure of the complex, the cost of inserting the inorganic catalyst in place of the natural ligand/substrate into the host and how experimental knowledge can improve or invalidate a theoretical model. As a real case system, we studied an artificial metalloenzyme obtained by the insertion of a Fe(Schiff base) moiety into the heme oxygenase of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The experimental structure of this species shows a distorted cofactor leading to an unusual octahedral configuration of the iron with two proximal residues chelating the metal and no external ligand. This geometry is far from the conformation adopted by similar cofactors in other hosts and shows that a fine tuning exists between the coordination environment of the metal, the deformability of its organic ligand and the conformational adaptability of the receptor. In a field where very little structural information is yet available, this work should help in building an initial molecular modelling framework for the discovery, design and optimization of inorganic cofactors.

In this work, we have shown that the nitrate ligands in 1-NO3 can be replaced by azide, a more basic coordinating base, resulting in the formation of a more potent Co(IV)-diazide species (1-N3) that reacts with substrates (hydrocarbons and phenols) at faster rate constants and activates stronger C-H bonds than the parent complex 1-NO3. We have characterized 1-N3 employing a combination of spectroscopic and computational approaches. Our results clearly show that the coordination of azide leads to the modulation of the Co(IV) electronic structure and the Co(IV/III) redox potential. Together with the higher basicity of azide, these thermodynamic parameters contribute to the higher driving forces of 1-N3 than 1-NO3 for C-H bond activation.

However, the complexity of these systems often hampers detailed studies of their fundamental properties. To glean valuable mechanistic insight into how these catalysts function, this research group has prepared a family of dinucleating 1,8-naphthyridine ligands that bind two first-row transition metals in close proximity, originally designed to help mimic the proposed active site of metal oxide surfaces. Of the various bimetallic combinations examined, dicopper(I) is particularly versatile, as neutral bridging ligands adopt a variety of different binding modes depending on the configuration of frontier orbitals available to interact with the Cu centers. Organodicopper complexes are readily accessible, either through the traditional route of salt metathesis or via the activation of tetraarylborate anions through aryl group abstraction by a dicopper(I) unit. The resulting bridging aryl complexes engage in C-H bond activations, notably with terminal alkynes to afford bridging alkynyl species. The μ-hydrocarbyl complexes are surprisingly tolerant of water and elevated temperatures. This stability was leveraged to isolate a species that typically represents a fleeting intermediate in Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne coupling (CuAAC); reaction of a bridging alkynyl complex with an organic azide afforded the first example of a well-defined, symmetrically bridged dicopper triazolide. This complex was shown to be an intermediate during CuAAC, providing support for a proposed bimetallic mechanism. These platforms are not limited to formally low oxidation states; chemical oxidation of the hydrocarbyl complexes cleanly results in formation of mixed valence CuICuII complexes with varying degrees of distortion in both the bridging moiety and the dicopper core. Higher oxidation states, e.g., dicopper(II), are easily accessed via oxidation of a dicopper(I) compound with air to give a CuII2(μ-OH)2 complex. Reduction of this compound with silanes resulted in the unexpected formation of pentametallic copper(I) dihydride clusters or trimetallic monohydride complexes, depending on the nature of the silane. Finally, development of an unsymmetrical naphthyridine ligand with mixed donor side-arms enables selective synthesis of an isostructural series of six heterobimetallic complexes, demonstrating the power of ligand design in the preparation of heterometallic assemblies.",True,False,,

Active site D is generated after coordination of first monomer PA by extrusion of the Rh(I)(PA) complex to a hydrophobic pocket near site B. Polymerization occurs in site D via a Rh(I)-insertion mechanism. A specific ""hydrophobic region"" composed by the hydrophobic active site D, the nonpolar 4-fold channel, and other hydrophobic residues nearby is found to facilitate accumulation, coordination, and insertion of PA for polymerization.

Artificial metal binding sites were created near the heme of cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) such that one of the heme propionates could serve as a metal ligand.

The kinetic parameters for this activity vary considerably in the presence of various dicarboxylic acid chelators, suggesting that the similar features displayed by native MnP are largely intrinsic to the manganese oxidation reaction rather than due to a specific interaction between the chelator and enzyme. Analysis of pre-steady-state data shows that electron transfer from Mn2+ to both the Trp-191 radical and the ferryl heme center of compound ES is enhanced by the metal site mutations, with transfer to the ferryl center showing the greatest stimulation. These properties are perplexingly similar to those reported for an alternate model for this site (1), despite rather distinct features of the two designs.

There are at least 16 different CA isoforms in the alpha structural class (α-CAs) that have been isolated in higher vertebrates, with CA isoform II (CA II) being ubiquitously abundant in all human cell types. CA inhibition has been exploited clinically for decades for various classes of diuretics and anti-glaucoma treatment. The characterization of the overexpression of CA isoform IX (CA IX) in certain tumors has raised interest in CA IX as a diagnostic marker and drug target for aggressive cancers and therefore the development of CA IX specific inhibitors. An important goal in the field of CA is to identify, rationalize, and design potential compounds that will preferentially inhibit CA IX over all other isoforms of CA. The variations in the active sites between isoforms of CA are subtle and this causes non-specific CA inhibition which leads to various side effects. In the case of CA IX inhibition, CA II along with other isoforms of CA provide off-target binding sites which is undesirable for cancer treatment. The focus of this article is on CA IX inhibition and two different structural approaches to CA isoform specific drug designing: tail approach and fragment addition approach.",True,False,,"Binding Sites, Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitorschemistrymetabolism, Carbonic Anhydraseschemistrymetabolism, Catalytic Domain, Databases, Protein, Drug Design, Humans, Isoenzymeschemistrymetabolism, Neoplasmsenzymologypathology, Protein Binding, Sulfonamideschemistrymetabolism"

These zinc metalloenzymes belong to the superfamily of cyclic amidohydrolases, comprising also other enzymes that are involved in degradation of either purines (allantoinases), pyrimidines (dihydropyrimidinases) or hydantoins (hydantoinases). The evolutionary relationships between these mechanistically related enzymes were estimated after designing a method to build an accurate multiple sequence alignment. The amino acid sequences that have been crystallized were used to build a seed alignment. All the remaining homologues were progressively added by aligning their HMM profiles to the seed HMM profile, allowing to obtain a reliable phylogeny of the superfamily. This helped us to propose a new evolutionary classification of dihydroorotases into three major types, while at the same time disentangling an important part of the history of their complex structure-function relationships. Although differing in their substrate specificity, allantoinases, hydantoinases and dihydropyrimidinases are found to be phylogenetically closer to DHOase Type I than the proximity of the three DHOase types to each other. This suggests that the primordial cyclic amidohydrolase was a multifunctional, highly evolvable generalist, with high conformational diversity allowing for promiscuous activities. Then, successive gene duplications allowed resolving the primordial substrate ambiguity in various substrate specificities.

In this study, K238H-AeL nanopores with histidine sites were designed as single-molecule reactors for the measurement of single-molecule coordination reactions. The coordination mechanism of Au(III) with histidine and glutamate in biological nanopore confined space was explored. Specifically, Au(III) interacts with the nitrogen (N) atom in the histidine imidazole ring of the K238H-AeL nanopore and the oxygen (O) atom in glutamate to form a stable K238H-Au-Cl2 complex. The formation mechanism of this complex was further validated through single-molecule nanopore analysis, mass spectrometry, and molecular dynamics simulations. Introducing histidine and negative charge amino acids with carboxyl group into different positions within the nanopore revealed that the formation of the histidine-Au coordination bond in the confined space requires a suitable distance between the ligand and the central metal atom. By analyzing the association and dissociation rates of the single Au(III) ion under the applied voltages, it was found that a confined nanopore increased the bonding rate constant of Au(III)-histidine coordination reactions by around 10-100 times compared to that in the bulk solution and the optimal voltage for single-molecule.

To answer this question, we have designed a biosynthetic model of LPMO by incorporating the Cu His-brace motif into azurin, an electron transfer protein. Spectroscopic studies, including ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance, confirm copper binding at the designed His-brace site. Moreover, the designed protein is catalytically active towards both cellulose and starch, the native substrates of LPMO, generating degraded oligosaccharides with multiturnovers by C1 oxidation. It also performs oxidative cleavage of the model substrate 4-nitrophenyl-D-glucopyranoside, achieving a turnover number ~9% of that of a native LPMO assayed under identical conditions. This work presents a rationally designed artificial metalloenzyme that acts as a structural and functional mimic of LPMO, which provides a promising system for understanding the role of the Cu His-brace site in LPMO activity and potential application in polysaccharide degradation.",True,False,,"Mixed Function Oxygenasesmetabolism, Coppermetabolism, Histidine, Polysaccharidesmetabolism"

In order to determine the free energy contribution of Zn(2+) binding by known metalloenzyme inhibitors without the other interactions, valid active site zinc structural mimetics must be formed and binding studies need to be performed in biologically relevant conditions. The potential of each of five ligands to form a structural mimetic with Zn(2+) was investigated in buffer using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC). All five ligands formed strong 1 : 1 (ligand : Zn(2+)) binary complexes. The complexes were used in further ITC experiments to study their interaction with 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ) and/or acetohydroxamic acid (AHA), two bidentate anionic zinc-chelating enzyme inhibitors. It was found that tetradentate ligands were not suitable for creating zinc structural mimetics for inhibitor binding in solution due to insufficient coordination sites remaining on Zn(2+). A stable binary complex, [Zn(BPA)](2+), which was formed by a tridentate ligand, bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (BPA), was found to bind one AHA in buffer or a methanol : buffer mixture (60 : 40 by volume) at pH 7.25 or one 8-HQ in the methanol : buffer mixture at pH 6.80, making it an effective structural mimetic for the active site of zinc metalloenzymes. These results are consistent with the observation that metalloenzyme active site zinc ions have three residues coordinated to them, leaving one or two sites open for inhibitors to bind. Our findings indicate that Zn(BPA)X2 can be used as an active site structural mimetic for zinc metalloenzymes for estimating the free energy contribution of zinc binding to the overall inhibitor active site interactions.

CA isozymes have been broadly studied in many pathological/physiological processes. In the current research, a series of 4-hydroxy-L-proline derivatives were designed and chemically synthetized, and interaction of these carboxylic acid-based compounds with hCA II were evaluated. Results indicated that different derivatives had different potencies on hCAII inhibitory activity and among them, compounds 3 b and 3c had the lowest IC50 and Kd values than 4-hydroxy-L-proline and other derivatives and therefore had the most affinity to the hCA II enzyme. As a result, compounds 3 b and 3c were chosen for additional testing in this research. The Kinetic data demonstrated that 3 b and 3c inhibit the hCA II esterase activity in a linear competitive way, with Ki values in the low micromolar range. Fluorescence tests showed that the hCA II surface hydrophobicity is diminished in the presence of compounds 3 b and 3c, as confirmed by the decrease in ANS binding to hCA II in their presence. Docking results revealed that 3 b and 3c had more binding energy than 4-hydroxy-L-proline. Furthermore, these compounds could occupy the active site of hCA II, where they would interact with critical amino acid residues via non-covalent forces to inhibit hCA II. Overall, the strengthening of inhibitory activity and the binding power of these carboxylic acid derivatives (3 b and 3c) for the hCA II makes these compounds interesting for designing novel hCA II inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

To overcome this drawback, drug candidates can be formulated as prodrugs. While a variety of protecting groups have been developed, increasing efforts have been devoted towards the use of caging groups that can be removed upon exposure to light to provide spatial and temporal control over the treatment. Among these, the application of Ru(ii) polypyridine complexes is receiving increased attention based on their attractive biological and photophysical properties.

The conjugate was designed using density functional theory calculations and docking studies. The conjugate is stable in an aqueous solution, but irradiation of the complex with 450 nm light releases the inhibitor within several minutes. As a model system, the biochemical properties were investigated against the endonucleolytic active site of the influenza virus. While showing no inhibition in the dark in an in vitro assay, the conjugate generated inhibition upon light exposure at 450 nm, demonstrating the ability to liberate the metalloenzyme inhibitor.

The promiscuity of the chaperonin cavity is an essential element of this design, which can mimic the hydrophobic binding pocket in natural metalloenzymes to accept cofactor and substrate without requiring specific ligand-protein interactions. The success of this approach is manifested in the efficient loading of multiple monomeric hemin cofactors to the GroEL cavity by detergent dialysis and good catalytic oxidation properties of the resulting biohybrid in tandem with those of the clean oxidant of H2O2. Investigation of the mechanism of hemin-GroEL-catalyzed oxidation of two-model substrates reveals that the kinetic behavior of the complex follows a ping-pong mechanism in both cases. Through comparison with horseradish peroxidase, the oxidative activity and stability of hemin-GroEL were observed to be similar to those found in natural peroxidases. Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-regulated partial dissociation of the biohybrid, as assessed by the reduction of its catalytic activity with the addition of the nucleotide, raises the prospect that ATP may be used to recycle the chaperonin scaffold. Moreover, hemin-GroEL can be applied to the chromogenic detection of H2O2, which (or peroxide in general) is commonly contained in industrial wastes. Considering the rich chemistry of free metalloporphyrins and the ease of production of GroEL and its supramolecular complex with hemin, this work should seed the creation of many new artificial metalloenzymes with diverse reactivities.",True,False,,

Development of novel and efficient inhibitors is required, as the chemical space of metal binding groups (MBGs) is currently limited to four main classes. The use of computational chemistry methods in drug discovery has gained momentum thanks to accurate estimates of binding modes and binding free energies of ligands to receptors. However, exact predictions of binding free energies in metalloenzymes are challenging due to the occurrence of nonclassical phenomena and interactions that common force field-based methods are unable to correctly describe. In this regard, we applied density functional theory (DFT) to predict the binding free energies and to understand the structure-activity relationship of metalloenzyme fragment-like inhibitors. We tested this method on a set of small-molecule inhibitors with different electronic properties and coordinating two Mn2+ ions in the binding site of the influenza RNA polymerase PAN endonuclease. We modeled the binding site using only atoms from the first coordination shell, hence reducing the computational cost. Thanks to the explicit treatment of electrons by DFT, we highlighted the main contributions to the binding free energies and the electronic features differentiating strong and weak inhibitors, achieving good qualitative correlation with the experimentally determined affinities. By introducing automated docking, we explored alternative ways to coordinate the metal centers and we identified 70% of the highest affinity inhibitors. This methodology provides a fast and predictive tool for the identification of key features of metalloenzyme MBGs, which can be useful for the design of new and efficient drugs targeting these ubiquitous proteins.",True,False,,

As small GTPases are pivotal for cellular survival, GGPPS was highlighted as a potential target for treating human diseases, including solid and hematologic malignancies and parasitic infections. Most available GGPPS inhibitors are bisphosphonates, but the clinically available compounds demonstrate poor pharmacokinetic properties. Although the design of novel bisphosphonates with improved physicochemical properties is highly desirable, the structure of wild-type human GGPPS (hGGPPS) bound to a bisphosphonate has not been resolved. Moreover, various metal-bisphosphonate-binding stoichiometries were previously reported in structures of yeast GGPPS (yGGPPS), hampering computational drug design with metal-binding pharmacophores (MBP). In this study, we report the 2.2 Å crystal structure of hGGPPS in complex with ibandronate, clearly depicting the involvement of three Mg2+ ions in bisphosphonate-protein interactions.

As a result, most designed metalloenzymes have low metal-binding affinity and activity. Here we identified three mutations in the second coordination shell of an engineered Mn(II)-binding site in cytochrome c peroxidase (called MnCcP.1, containing Glu45, Glu37, and Glu181 ligands) that mimics the native manganese peroxidase (MnP), and explored their effects on both Mn(II)-binding affinity and MnP activity. First, removing a hydrogen bond to Glu45 through Tyr36Phe mutation enhanced Mn(II)-binding affinity, as evidenced by a 2.8-fold decrease in the KM of Mn(II) oxidation. Second, introducing a salt bridge through Lys179Arg mutation improved Glu35 and Glu181 coordination to Mn(II), decreasing KM 2.6-fold. Third, eliminating a steric clash that prevented Glu37 from orienting toward Mn(II) resulted in an 8.6-fold increase in kcat/KM, arising primarily from a 3.6-fold decrease in KM, with a KM value comparable to that of the native enzyme (0.28 mM vs 0.19 mM for Pleurotus eryngii MnP PS3). We further demonstrated that while the effects of Tyr36Phe and Lys179Arg mutations are additive, because involved in secondary-shell interactions to different ligands, other combinations of mutations were antagonistic because they act on different aspects of the Mn(II) coordination at the same residues. Finally, we showed that these MnCcP variants are functional models of MnP that mimic its activity in both Mn(II) oxidation and degradation of a phenolic lignin model compound and kraft lignin. In addition to achieving KM in a designed protein that is similar to the that of native enzyme, our results offer molecular insight into the role of noncovalent interactions around metal-binding sites for improving metal binding and overall activity; such insight can be applied to rationally enhance these properties in other metalloenzymes and their models.",True,False,,"Binding Sitesphysiology, Crystallization, Cytochrome-c Peroxidasechemistrymetabolism, Enzyme Activationphysiology, Manganesechemistrymetabolism, Peroxidaseschemistrymetabolism, Protein Structure, Secondary"

We have previously reported a dual anchoring method to position a nonnative cofactor, MnSalen (1), inside the heme cavity of apo sperm whale myoglobin (Mb) and showed that the dual anchoring can increase both the activity and enantioselectivity over the single anchoring methods, making this artificial enzyme an ideal system to address the above questions. Here we report systematic investigations of the effect of different covalent attachment or anchoring positions on reactivity and selectivity of sulfoxidation by the MnSalen-containing Mb enzymes. We have found that changing the left anchor from Y103C to T39C has an almost identical effect of increasing rate by 1.8-fold and increasing selectivity by +14% for S, whether the right anchor is L72C or S108C. At the same time, regardless of the identity of the left anchor, changing the right anchor from S108C to L72C increases rate by 4-fold and selectivity by +66%. The right anchor site was observed to have a greater influence than the left anchor site on the reactivity and selectivity in sulfoxidation of a wide scope of other ortho-, meta- and para- substituted substrates. The 1•Mb(T39C/L72C) showed the highest reactivity (TON up to 2.31 min(-1)) and selectivity (ee% up to 83%) among the different anchoring positions examined. Molecular dynamic simulations indicate that these changes in reactivity and selectivity may be due to the steric effects of the linker arms inside the protein cavity. These results indicate that small differences in the anchor positions can result in significant changes in reactivity and enantioselectivity, probably through steric interactions with substrates when they enter the substrate-binding pocket, and that the effects of right and left anchor positions are independent and additive in nature. The finding that the anchoring arms can influence both the positioning of the cofactor and steric control of substrate entrance will help design better functional metalloenzymes with predicted catalytic activity and selectivity.",True,False,,

Within this Perspective we detail our efforts to create a redox-active Cu nitrite reductase (NiR) by incorporating Cu into the hydrophobic interior of well-defined three-stranded coiled coils (3SCCs). The scaffold contains three histidine residues that provide a layer of three nitrogen donors that mimic the type 2 catalytic site of NiR. We have found that this strategy successfully produces an active and stable CuNiR model that functions for over 1000 turnovers. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that the Cu(I) site has a lower coordination number in comparison to the enzyme, whereas the Cu(II) geometry may more faithfully reproduce the NiR type 2 center. Mutations at the helical interface successfully produce a hydrogen bond between an interfacial Glu residue and the Culigating His residue, which allows for the tuning of the redox potential over a 100 mV range. We successfully created constructs with as much as a 120-fold improvement from the original design by modifying the steric bulk above or below the Cu binding site. These systems are now the most active water-soluble and stable artificial NiR catalysts yet produced. Several avenues for improving the catalytic efficiency of later designs are detailed within this Perspective, including adjustment of their resting oxidation state, the use of asymmetric scaffolds to allow for single amino acid mutation within the second coordination sphere, and the design of hydrogen-bonding networks to tune residue orientation and electronics. Through these studies the TRI-H system has given insight into the difficulties that arise in creating a de novo redox active enzyme.

This design yields the most active homogenous copper nitrite reductase (CuNiR) mimic in water. We achieved this result by controlling three factors. First, previous studies with Nδ and Nε -Methyl Histidine had indicated that a ligand providing pyridine-like electronic character to the copper site was superior to the more donating Nδ for nitrite reduction. By substitution of the parent histidine with the non-coded amino acids pyridyl alanine (3'-Pyridine [3'Py] vs 4'-Pyridine [4'Py]), an authentic pyridine donor was employed without the complications of the coupling of both electronic and tautomeric effects of histidine or methylated histidine. Second, by changing the position of the nitrogen atom within the active site (4'-Pyridine vs. 3'Pyridine) a doubling of the enzyme's catalytic efficiency resulted. This effect was driven exclusivity by substrate binding to the copper site. Third, we replaced the leucine layer adjacent to the active site with an alanine, and the disparity between the 3'Py and 4'Py became more apparent. The decreased steric bulk minimally impacted the 3'Py derivative; however, the 4'Py K m decreased by an order of magnitude (600 mM to 50 mM), resulting in a 40-fold enhancement in the k cat/K m compared to the analogues histidine site and a 1500-fold improvement compared with the initially reported CuNiR catalyst of this family, TRIW-H. When combined with XANES/EXAFS data, the relaxing of the Cu(I) site to a more 2-coordinate Cu(I) like structure in the resting state increases the overall catalytic efficiency of nitrite reduction via the lowering of K m. This study illustrates how by combining advanced spectroscopic methods, detailed kinetic analysis, and a broad toolbox of amino acid side chain functionality, one can rationally design systems that optimize biomimetic catalysis.",True,False,,

We validated our model against other metalloenzymes, the valence bond model and the Mn spin densities calculated using density functional theory for two of the mismatched predictions of PSII.

In a recent strategy, the naturally occurring Fe metal in the heme unit was replaced with non-native metals such as Ir, Rh, Co, Cu, etc., and axial ligands to generate artificial metalloenzymes. Determining the best metal-ligand for a chemical transformation is not a trivial task. Here we demonstrate how computational approaches can be used in deciding the best metal-ligand combination which would be highly beneficial in designing new enzymes as well as small molecule catalysts. We have used Density Functional Theory (DFT) to shed light on the enhanced reactivity of an Ir system with varying axial ligands. We look at the insertion of a carbene group generated from diazo precursors via N2 extrusion into a C-H bond. For both Ir(Me) and Fe systems, the first step, i.e., N2 extrusion is the rate determining step. Strikingly, neither the better ligand overlap with 5d orbitals on Ir nor the electrophilicity on the carbene centre play a significant role. A comparison of Fe and Ir systems reveals that a lower distortion in the Ir(Me)-porphyrin on moving from the reactant to the transition state renders it catalytically more active. We notice that for both metal porphyrins, the free energy barriers are affected by axial ligand substitution. Further, for Fe porphyrin, the axial ligand also changes the preferred spin state. We show that for the carbene insertion into the C-H bond, Fe porphyrin systems undergo a stepwise HAT (hydrogen atom transfer) instead of a concerted hydride transfer process. Importantly, we find that the substitution of the axial Me ligand on Ir to imidazole or chloride, or without an axial substitution changes the rate determining step of the reaction. Therefore, an optimum ligand that can balance the barriers for both steps of the catalytic cycle is essential.

Here we show that one of the key lessons learned from the science of catalytic antibodies--that binding energy can be converted into chemical energy--can be exploited to 'fine-tune' the physicochemical properties of a metal complex. We show that an antibody's binding site can reversibly perturb the coordination geometry of a metal ion, and can stabilize a high-energy coordinated species. Specifically, antibodies designed to bind the organosilicon compound 1 also bind the geometrically similar Cu(I) complex 2.

We report an inhibition study of this enzyme with inorganic anions and several other small molecules known to interact with these metalloenzymes. Bicarbonate, carbonate and sulfate were ineffective SazCA inhibitors whereas most other inorganic anions were submillimolar inhibitors. The best inhibition was observed with trithiocarbonate, diethyldithiocarbamate, sulfamide, sulfamate, phenylboronic, and phenylarsonic acid, which showed inhibition constants in the range of 3-39 μM. As SazCA is very stable at high temperatures (being an 'extremo-CA') and very effective as a catalyst, the inhibition studies reported here may be crucial for designing biotechnological applications for this enzyme, for example for CO(2) capture processes.",True,False,,"Amino Acid Sequence, Anionschemistrymetabolism, Bacteriaenzymology, Carbon Dioxidechemistrymetabolism, Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitorschemistrymetabolism, Carbonic Anhydraseschemistryclassificationmetabolism, Catalysis, Kinetics, Molecular Sequence Data, Phylogeny, Protein Binding, Sequence Alignment, Temperature"

Here, we propose the marine unicellular diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum as a model organism for testing the membrane penetrability of CA inhibitors (CAIs). Seven inhibitors belonging to the sulphonamide type and possessing a diverse scaffold have been explored for their in vitro inhibition of the whole diatom CAs and the in vivo inhibitory effect on the growth of P. tricornutum. Interesting, inhibition of growth was observed, in vivo, demonstrating that this diatom is a good model for testing the cell wall penetrability of this class of pharmacological agents. Considering that many pathogens are difficult and dangerous to grow in the laboratory, the growth inhibition of P. tricornutum with different such CAIs may be subsequently used to design inhibition studies of CAs from pathogenic organisms.",True,False,,"Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitorschemical synthesischemistrypharmacology, Carbonic Anhydrasesisolation & purificationmetabolism, Cell Membrane Permeabilitydrug effects, Diatomsdrug effectsenzymologygrowth & development, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Models, Molecular, Molecular Structure, Structure-Activity Relationship, Sulfonamideschemical synthesischemistrypharmacology"
