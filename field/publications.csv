Sequence-Dependent Slowdown of DNA Translocation Using Transmembrane RNA–DNA Interactions in MoS2 Nanopore,"Dong Zhang, Mingjiao Zhang, Ruhong Zhou",2025.0,0,{},"The Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 2025",The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,,,,American Chemical Society,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:f6xaZhr4TK4J:scholar.google.com/,2006ce70fce6e62589f165204c2a235afc1b47e9,49.0,0.0,False,,JournalArticle,2025-01-13,"The emergence of nanopores in two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials offers an attractive solid-state platform for high-throughput and low-cost DNA sequencing. However, several challenges remain to be addressed before their wide application, including the too-fast DNA translocation speed (compared to state-of-the-art single nucleoside detection techniques) and too large noise/signal ratios due to DNA fluctuations inside the nanopores. Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing RNA-DNA interactions in modulating DNA translocations in 2D MoS2 nanopores. By constructing a transmembrane-RNA-oligonucleotide-decorated nanopore (TOD nanopore), we find that the translocation speed of DNA can be significantly slowed in a sequence-dependent manner, with up to 160-fold deceleration compared with the naked control. The strong interactions between the translocating DNA and the first and second guanines of transmembrane RNAs are thought to play a key role in regulating the translocation process. Moreover, the observed suppression of base conformational fluctuations within the TOD nanopore can further improve the single nucleotide detecting resolution. Therefore, our investigations demonstrate that the proposed TOD nanopore can be a potential candidate for enhanced DNA sequencing with solid-state nanopores.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2006ce70fce6e62589f165204c2a235afc1b47e9,Investigations demonstrate that the proposed TOD nanopore can be a potential candidate for enhanced DNA sequencing with solid-state nanopores and the observed suppression of base conformational fluctuations within the TOD nanopore can further improve the single nucleotide detecting resolution.,D.

Recent discoveries suggest these unique physical signals are converted into biochemical signals through a mechanotransduction process that influences the biological behavior of tumor cells and stromal cells. This process facilitates the occurrence and progression of tumors.

However, the current methods often fall short in leveraging structural data efficiently and providing comprehensive guidance for neoantigen selection. To address these limitations, we introduce NEOM, a novel neoantigen maturation framework encompassing five distinct modules: “policy”, “structure”, “evaluation”, “selection” and “filter”. This framework is designed to enhance precision, interpretability, customizability and cost-effectiveness in neoantigen screening. We evaluated NEOM using a set of random synthetic peptides, followed by available clinically-derived peptides. NEOM achieved higher performance on generated peptide quality compared to other baseline models. Using established predictors for filtering revealed a substantial number of peptides with immunogenic potential. Subsequently, a more rigorous binding affinity evaluation using free energy perturbation methods identified 6 out of 38 candidates showing superior binding characteristics. MHC tetramer peptide exchange assays and flow cytometry experiments further validate five of them.

Despite the emerging consensus, whether this law applies to microscopic systems adhering to quantum mechanics remains a fundamental and open question, due to limitations in even the most state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Here, we report an anomalous constitutive law of hydrogen bonds (X-H···Y) using a benchmark method. Notably, a donor X-H bond shortening occurred simultaneously with an unexpected redshift and enhanced intensity in IR spectra. The reason for donor X-H bond shortening is attributed to both the slowly increasing attractive force from the acceptor Y atom and the increasing short-range repulsive forces from other protons attached to the approaching acceptor Y atom. Furthermore, neither eliminating vibrational mixing nor introducing various physical effects make vibrational spectra respond to X-H bond shortening. Other structural-characterization NMR spectra provide robust evidence for this anomalous law. This anomalous law is ascribed to the interplay of electronic correlations. Our Letter thus inspires a reassessment of paradigms, which broadens the scope of microscopic behavior for finer control.

Here, we report the structure of DdrI, a CRP family protein from Deinococcus radiodurans. Combined with biochemical, kinetic, and molecular dynamics simulations analyses, our results indicate that DdrI adopts a DNA-binding conformation in the absence of cAMP and can form stable complexes with the target DNA sequence of classical CRPs. Further analysis revealed that the high-affinity cAMP binding pocket of DdrI is partially filled with Tyr113-Arg55-Glu65 sidechains, mimicking the anti-cAMP-mediated allosteric transition. Moreover, the second syn-cAMP binding site of DdrI at the protein-DNA interface is more negatively charged compared to that of classical CRPs, and manganese ions can enhance its DNA binding affinity. DdrI can also bind to a target sequence that mimics another transcription factor, DdrO, suggesting potential cross-talk between these two transcription factors. These findings reveal a class of CRPs that are independent of cAMP activation and provide valuable insights into the environmental adaptation mechanisms of D. radiodurans.IMPORTANCEBacteria need to respond to environmental changes at the gene transcriptional level, which is critical for their evolution, virulence, and industrial applications. The cAMP receptor protein (CRP) of Escherichia coli (ecCRP) senses changes in intracellular cAMP levels and is a classic example of allosteric effects in textbooks. However, the structures and biochemical activities of CRPs are not generally conserved and there exist different mechanisms. In this study, we found that the proposed CRP from Deinococcus radiodurans, DdrI, exhibited DNA binding ability independent of cAMP binding and adopted an apo structure resembling the activated CRP. Manganese can enhance the DNA binding of DdrI while allowing some degree of freedom for its target sequence. These results suggest that CRPs can evolve to become a class of cAMP-independent global regulators, enabling bacteria to adapt to different environments according to their characteristics.

Here, we present a dual-functional nanoinhibitor meticulously designed to target the aggregation driving force and amyloid fibril spatial structure. Leveraging the exceptional structural stability and facile tailoring capability of endohedral metallofullerene Gd@C82, we introduce desired hydrogen-binding sites and charged groups, which are abundant on its surface for specific designs. Impressively, these designs endow the resultant functionalized-Gd@C82 nanoparticles (f-Gd@C82 NPs) with high capability of redirecting peptide self-assembly toward disordered, off-pathway species, obstructing the early growth of protofibrils, and disaggregating the preformed well-ordered protofibrils or even mature Aβ fibrils. This results in considerable alleviation of Aβ peptide-induced neuronal cytotoxicity, rescuing neuronal death and synaptic loss in primary neuron models. Notably, these modifications significantly improved the dispersibility of f-Gd@C82 NPs, thus substantially enhancing its bioavailability.

The challenge in mitigating this malignancy can be attributed to the digestive organ expansion factor (DEF), a pivotal yet underexplored factor in pancreatic tumorigenesis. The study uses a blend of in vitro and in vivo approaches, complemented by the theoretical analyses, to propose DEF as a promising anti-tumor target. Analysis of clinical samples reveals that high expression of DEF is correlated with diminished survival in pancreatic cancer patients. Crucially, the depletion of DEF significantly impedes tumor growth. The study further discovers that DEF binds to p65, shielding it from degradation mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in cancer cells. Based on these findings and computational approaches, the study formulates a DEF-mimicking peptide, peptide-031, designed to disrupt the DEF-p65 interaction. The effectiveness of peptide-031 in inhibiting tumor proliferation has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo.

Therefore, the promotion of NP permeation into deep tumor sites via the regulation of tumor microenvironments is of critical importance. Herein, we propose a potential solution using a dihydralazine (HDZ)‐loaded nanoparticle drug delivery system containing a pH‐responsive, cyclic RGD peptide‐modified prodrug based on doxorubicin (cRGD‐Dex‐DOX). With a combined experimental and theoretical approach, we find that the designed NP system can recognize the acid tumor environments and precisely release the encapsulated HDZ into tumor tissues. HDZ can notably downregulate the expression levels of hypoxia‐inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), α‐smooth muscle actin, and fibronectin through the dilation of tumor blood vessels. These changes in the TSMs enhance the enrichment and penetration of NPs and also unexpectedly promote the infiltration of activated T cells into tumors, suggesting that such a system may offer an effective “multifunctional therapy” through both improving the chemotherapeutic effect and enhancing the immune response to tumors.

The scarcity, heterogeneity and intrinsic complexity of tumor EVs present a major technological challenge in real-time monitoring of complex cancers such as glioblastoma (GBM). Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) outputs a label-free spectroscopic fingerprint for EV molecular profiling. However, it has not been exploited to detect known biomarkers at the single EV level. We developed a multiplex fluidic device with embedded arrayed nanocavity microchips (MoSERS microchip) that achieves 97% confinement of single EVs in a minute amount of fluid (<10 μL) and enables molecular profiling of single EVs with SERS. The nanocavity arrays combine two featuring characteristics: (1) An embedded MoS2 monolayer that enables label-free isolation and nanoconfinement of single EVs due to physical interaction (Coulomb and van der Waals) between the MoS2 edge sites and the lipid bilayer; and (2) A layered plasmonic cavity that enables sufficient electromagnetic field enhancement inside the cavities to obtain a single EV level signal resolution for stratifying the molecular alterations. We used the GBM paradigm to demonstrate the diagnostic potential of the SERS single EV molecular profiling approach. The MoSERS multiplexing fluidic achieves parallel signal acquisition of glioma molecular variants (EGFRvIII oncogenic mutation and MGMT expression) in GBM cells. The detection limit of 1.23% was found for stratifying these key molecular variants in the wild-type population. When interfaced with a convolutional neural network (CNN), MoSERS improved diagnostic accuracy (87%) with which GBM mutations were detected in 12 patient blood samples, on par with clinical pathology tests.

Convenient and painless noninvasive transdermal insulin delivery has long been pursued but yet succeeded due to no such technologies for large biomacromolecules. We find a tertiary amine oxide-based polyzwitterion, OPDMA, that can efficiently penetrate both the stratum corneum (SC) and viable epidermis into circulation. So its conjugate with insulin, OPDMA-I, applied on the skin can exhibit hypoglycemic effects as efficiently as subcutaneously injected insulin in type-1 diabetic mice and minipigs. The unique pH-dependent cationic-to-zwitterionic transition of OPDMA in the characteristic acidic-to-neutral pH gradient from the skin surface to deep SC enables fast transdermal delivery of OPDMA and its conjugate. On the skin, OPDMA binds to carboxylic acids in the acidic sebum layer, enriching OPDMA-I on the SC. As pH increases in deeper SC layers, binding between OPDMA-I and the skin weakens gradually, allowing for diffusion through inter-corneocyte gaps and penetration into viable epidermis and finally entering the systemic circulation via dermal lymphatic vessels. This process does not alter SC microstructures or cause any physiological changes in the skin.

Furthermore, the confinement by multiple hydrogen bonding interactions as well as the compact aggregation of phosphors jointly suppresses the nonradiative transitions, leading to long‐lived excimer RTP (τ = 543.9 ms, 19,000‐fold improvements over the powder). On account of the outstanding afterglow performance and color‐tunability of RTP materials, flexible and large‐area films were fabricated for intelligent display, anticounterfeiting, and time‐resolved information encryption.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29694fd880340e5dd1abe07b34e47715a3565631,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generally speaking, a multivalent aptamer can be constructed via post‐assembly based on chemical structural information of target molecules and pre‐identified monovalent aptamers derived from traditional systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) technology. However, many target molecules may not have known matched aptamer partners, thus a de novo evolution will be highly desired as an alternative strategy for directed selection of a high‐avidity, multivalent aptamer.

Furthermore, dynamic interactions between Amap and EpCAM are directly visualized by magnetic tweezers at the single‐molecule level.

Despite its quick disappearance worldwide, the strong virulence caused by a few point mutations remains an unsolved problem largely. Along with the other two sublineages, the Delta variant harbors an accumulation of Spike protein mutations, including the previously identified L452R, E484Q, and the newly emerged T478K on its receptor binding domain (RBD). We used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in combination with free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations, to examine the effects of two combinative mutation sets, L452R + E484Q and L452R + T478K. Our dynamic trajectories reveal an enhancement in binding affinity between mutated RBD and the common receptor protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through a net increase in the buried molecular surface area of the binary complex. This enhanced binding, mediated through Gln493, sets the same stage for all three sublineages due to the presence of L452R mutation. The other mutation component, E484Q or T478K, was found to impact the RBD-ACE2 binding and help the variant to evade several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in a distinct manner. Especially for L452R + T478K, synergies between mutations are mediated through a complex residual and water interaction network and further enhance its binding to ACE2.

However, it remains unclear how the nanomedicines' physicochemical properties influence the GGT-responsive cationization and induced transcytosis behaviors. Herein, through a combination of experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find that the random copolymers with high hydrophobic monomers tend to form compact structures accessible to the catalytic site of GGT, leading to a fast cationization and thus high transcytosis efficiency, while the homopolymers of the hydrophilic GGT-sensitive monomers have elongated structures unable to enter the active site and thus exhibit poor GGT sensitivity. As a result, the more hydrophobic polymer-drug conjugates with high camptothecin contents exhibit higher GGT-responsive activity, which in turn leads to faster cationization and cellular internalization, enhanced tumor infiltration, and more potent antitumor activity.

Crystal structures of the water-soluble forms of a 12-helical pore and a 16-helical pore closely match the computational design models. Patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments show that, when expressed in insect cells, the transmembrane form of the 12-helix pore enables the passage of ions across the membrane with high selectivity for potassium over sodium; ion passage is blocked by specific chemical modification at the pore entrance. When incorporated into liposomes using in vitro protein synthesis, the transmembrane form of the 16-helix pore-but not the 12-helix pore-enables the passage of biotinylated Alexa Fluor 488. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the 16-helix transmembrane pore closely matches the design model.

Our simulation results show that when the charge density increases in the polyplex, more lipids, especially CHEMS (a negatively charged helper lipid) lipids, are attracted to the polyplex (positively charged) surface, and meanwhile nearby water molecules are driven away from the polyplex, resulting in a less spherical liposome. Energy decomposition analyses further reveal that, at higher charge densities, the polyplex exhibits much stronger interactions with CHEMS lipids than with water molecules, with the majority contribution from electrostatic interactions. In addition, the mobility of lipids, especially CHEMS, is reduced as the polyplex charge density increases, indicating a more rigid liposome.

Most of these bioactivities are related to their preference for binding to certain types of phospholipids and subsequently disrupt lipid membranes. In the present study, we use a cyclotide, cycloviolacin O2 (cyO2), as a model system to investigate its interactions with three lipid bilayers 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG)-doped POPE, and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), to help understand its potential mechanism of action toward the membranes at the molecular level using molecular dynamics simulations. In our simulations, cyO2 repeatedly forms stable binding complexes with the POPE-containing bilayers, while within the same simulation time scale, it ""jumps"" back and forth on the surface of the POPC bilayer without a strong binding. Detailed analyses reveal that the electrostatic attraction is the main driving force for the initial bindings between cyO2 and the lipids, but with strikingly different strengths in different bilayers. For the POPE-containing bilayers, the charged residues of cyO2 attract both POPE amino and phosphate head groups favorably; meanwhile, its hydrophobic residues are deeply inserted into the lipid hydrophobic tails (core) of the membrane, thus forming stable binding complexes. In contrast, POPC lipids with three methyl groups on the amino head group create a steric hindrance when interacting with cyO2, thus resulting in a relatively difficult binding of cyO2 on POPC compared to POPE. Our current findings provide additional insights for a better understanding of how cyO2 binds to the POPE-containing membrane, which should shed light on the future cyclotide-based antibacterial agent design.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1beff6f5dc71a18d58a14681c94ee3e55ba7eaa9,"Detailed analyses reveal that the electrostatic attraction is the main driving force for the initial bindings between cyO2 and the lipids, but with strikingly different strengths in different bilayers, which should shed light on the future cyclotide-based antibacterial agent design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

By studying the geometry effect of graphene-MoS2 hetero-nanopores with molecular dynamics simulations, we have found that the shape of these nanopores (circular, square, or triangular, with similar size) may have a significant effect on the spontaneous translocation of ssDNA, with the triangular nanopore showing the slowest translocation and the circular one the fastest. Further analyses reveal that such differences in the spontaneous ssDNA translocation arise from different electrostatic attractions between the positively charged Mo atoms exposed in the pore and the negatively charged phosphate groups (PO4-) in nucleotides; the ""sharpness"" and the total number of the exposed Mo atoms of the nanopores are responsible for different electrostatic attractions between ssDNA and the nanopore. Our findings suggest that graphene-MoS2 heterostructure nanopores with lower symmetries (i.e., having sharper corners) are capable of slowing down the ssDNA translocation, which might help better facilitate the nucleotide sensing and DNA sequencing.

Recently, because of its positive results in clinical trials, remdesivir was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 through Emergency Use Authorization. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation methods to study the inhibition mechanism of remdesivir to its target SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We first constructed the homology model of this polymerase based on a previously available structure of SARS-CoV NSP12 RdRp (with a sequence identity of 95.8%). We then built a putative preinsertion binding structure by aligning the remdesivir + RdRp complex to the ATP bound poliovirus RdRp without the RNA template. The putative binding structure was further optimized with molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting stable preinsertion state of remdesivir appeared to form hydrogen bonds with the RNA template when aligned with the newly solved cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The relative binding free energy between remdesivir and ATP was calculated to be -2.80 ± 0.84 kcal/mol, where remdesivir bound much stronger to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp than the natural substrate ATP. The ∼100-fold improvement in the Kd from remdesivir over ATP indicates an effective replacement of ATP in blocking of the RdRp preinsertion site. Key residues D618, S549, and R555 are found to be the contributors to the binding affinity of remdesivir.

Alterations in HLA-I/peptide complexes can modulate binding of killer immunoglobuline-like receptors (KIRs) and thereby the function of natural killer (NK) cells. Although multiple studies have provided evidence that HLA-I/KIR interactions play a role in HIV-1 disease progression, the consequence of HIV-1 infection for HLA-I/KIR interactions remain largely unknown. Design: We determined changes in HLA-I presented peptides resulting from HIV-1-infection of primary human CD4+ T cells and assessed the impact of changes in peptide repertoires on HLA-I/KIR interactions. Methods: Liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry to identify HLA-I presented peptides, cell-based in-vitro assays to evaluate functional consequences of alterations in immunopeptidome and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to confirm experimental data. Results: A total of 583 peptides exclusively presented on HIV-1-infected cells were identified, of which only 0.2% represented HIV-1 derived peptides. Focusing on HLA-C∗03 : 04/KIR2DL3 interactions, we observed that HLA-C∗03 : 04-presented peptides derived from noninfected CD4+ T cells mediated stronger binding of inhibitory KIR2DL3 than peptides derived from HIV-1-infected cells. Furthermore, the most abundant peptide presented by HLA-C∗03 : 04 on noninfected CD4+ T cells (VIYPARISL) mediated the strongest KIR2DL3-binding, while the most abundant peptide presented on HIV-1-infected cells (YAIQATETL) did not mediate KIR2DL3-binding. Molecular dynamics simulations of HLA-C∗03 : 04/KIR2DL3 interactions in the context of these two peptides revealed that VIYPARISL significantly enhanced the HLA-C∗03 : 04/peptide contact area to KIR2DL3 compared with YAIQATETL. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that HIV-1 infection-induced changes in HLA-I-presented peptides can reduce engagement of inhibitory KIRs, providing a mechanism for enhanced activation of NK cells by virus-infected cells.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ec390a4174c8f2658b357172082a8c8f73abbc21,"It is demonstrated that HIV-1 infection-induced changes in HLA-I-presented peptides can reduce engagement of inhibitory KIRs, providing a mechanism for enhanced activation of NK cells by virus-infected cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we use both molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental techniques to investigate the interactions of phosphorene with a dsDNA segment. Our results reveal that dsDNA can form a stable binding on the phosphorene surface through the terminal base pairs and adopt an upright orientation regardless of its initial configurations. Moreover, the binding strength of dsDNA with phosphorene is found to be mild and does not cause significant distortion in the internal structure of dsDNA. This phenomenon is attributed to the weaker dispersion interaction between dsDNA and phosphorene. Further analysis of the free energy profile calculated by the umbrella sampling technique suggests that the puckered surface morphology significantly reduces the adsorption free energy of DNA bases to phosphorene.

However, 1T-MoS2 is thermodynamically metastable due to the distorted crystal structure. Recently, researchers have detected the J1 and A1g Raman peaks after the HER process and confirmed that the 2H-1T phase possesses good stability. Therefore, continuous HER is likely to transform 1T-MoS2 into a stable 2H-1T mixed phase. The in situ characterization of 1T-MoS2 individual nanosheets in the HER process is important to understand the intrinsic electrocatalytic behaviour at confined nanoscale, which has rarely been investigated. Herein, we built an individual 1T-MoS2 nanosheet micro-nano device by the intercalation of N-butyllithium into 2H-MoS2. Then, the device was kept at an overpotential (η) of 450 mV, which was much lower than the onset potential, for 20 minutes to ensure continuous HER. Through this electrochemical treatment, we successfully obtained a mixed phase of 2H-1T and monitored the electrochemical phase transition by in situ Raman mapping and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The HER performance of the 2H-1T phase was superior to that of 1T-MoS2 and 2H-MoS2.

Traditional detection methods suffer from clear demerits of either the presence of large interference from coexisting radioactive species (e.g., radioactivity counting methods) or the requirement of extensive instrumentation and analysis procedure (e.g., mass spectrometry). Here, we constructed a luminescent iridium(III) organometallic complex (Ir(ppy)2(bpy)+; ppy = 2-phenylpyridine, bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine)-grafted porous aromatic framework (Ir-PAF) for the first time, which can be utilized for efficient, facile, and selective detection of trace ReO4-/TcO4- in aqueous solutions. Importantly, the luminescence intensity of Ir-PAF is greatly enhanced in the presence of ReO4-/TcO4-, giving rise to a distinct turn-on sensor with the detection limit of 556.9 μg/L. Such a superior detection capability originates from the highly selective and strong interaction between ReO4-/TcO4- and Ir(ppy)2(bpy)+, leading to an efficient pre-enrichment of ReO4-/TcO4- during analysis and subsequently a much weaker nonradiative decay of the luminescence of Ir(ppy)2(bpy)+, as illustrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculation as well as quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime measurements.

This classical rule always governs the chemical bonding of s- and p-block homonuclear diatomic molecules, such as the stable σ2 electron-pair bonds in hydrogen. In this work, surprisingly, we found that the diversified open-shell single bonds between two f-block atoms (e.g., thorium) can be stabilized within a tight ""carbon-confined-space"" using relativistic quantum chemical calculations. We first identified a stable dithorium endohedral metallofullerene (EMF), Th26+@Ih-C806-, with a Th-Th distance of 3.803 Å inside the Ih-C80 cage, which displays a unique spin-polarized σ1π1 2-fold single-electron Th3+-Th3+ bond that is collaboratively dominated by 5f6d7s7p orbitals. The Th3+-Th3+ bond can further evolve into a 5f6d dominated spin-polarized π2 configuration by compressing the Th-Th distance further down to 2.843 Å, within a smaller Ih-C60 cage. On the other hand, elongating the Th-Th distance to 4.063 Å by encapsulating Th2 into a long diametric D3h-C78 fullerene returns the Th3+-Th3+ bond to the normal closed-shell (6d7s7p)σ2 form. Hence, a new rule is unambiguously revealed through the carbon-confinement induced spin-polarization of a single bond. The key point of this rule is the size of the carbon cage, because the squeezed effect is conducive to the effective overlap of the Th(5f) orbitals, reducing and further reversing the original large singlet-triplet energy gap of the Th26+ unit.

In the present study, we investigate the interaction of a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) segment with a wrinkled graphene nanosheet using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that dsDNA experiences severe structural deformation upon binding to the wrinkled graphene surface, whereas it tends to maintain its native structure upon binding to the idealized graphene nanosheet. Further analysis reveals that it is energetically advantageous for the terminal bases in dsDNA to bind to the wrinkled area, serving as anchors on the nanosheet.

However, the lack of adequate data regarding how MoS2 activates immunological responses of macrophages remains a key concern for its risk assessment. Here, we employ a combined theoretical and experimental approach to investigate the interactions of MoS2 and PEGylated MoS2 (MoS2-PEG) with macrophages. We first perform molecular dynamics simulations to examine the atomic-detailed interactions of MoS2 and MoS2-PEG nanoflakes with a realistic model of the macrophage membrane. We show that a small MoS2 nanoflake (edge length of 2.86 nm) is capable of penetrating the macrophage membrane independent of its concentration. We also demonstrate that when initiated with a corner point-on configuration, the surface-bound PEG chains of MoS2-PEG hinder its membrane insertion process, leading to a prolonged passage through the membrane. Moreover, when placed in a face-on arrangement initially, the MoS2-PEG exhibits a lower binding free energy than pristine MoS2 after its adsorption on the membrane surface. The PEG chains can even insert and get buried in the outer leaflet of the membrane, providing additional contact for membrane adsorption. Our flow cytometric experiments then show that the responses of macrophages to either MoS2-PEG or MoS2 are significantly higher than that of the control (no nanomaterial stimulus), with MoS2-PEG eliciting stronger cytokine secretion than the pristine MoS2. The characteristics of slower/prolonged membrane penetration and stronger membrane adsorption of MoS2-PEG compared to pristine MoS2 explain why it triggers more sustained stimulation and higher cytokine secretion in macrophages as observed in our experiments.

We demonstrate that HP35 is well preserved on the Pt(100) crystal surface, whereas it is severely disrupted on the Pt(111) crystal surface. This surprising difference originates from the distinct water behavior in the first solvation shell (FSS) of the two Pt crystal surfaces. Within the FSS of the Pt(100) crystal surface, water molecules form a very compact and stable monolayer through a highly uniform rhombic hydrogen-bond network. This water monolayer prefers the adsorption of acidic residues (such as Glu and Asp) and acts as a shield to prevent other residues from directly coming into contact with the metal surface. On the other hand, the hydrogen bond network in the water monolayer in the FSS of the Pt(111) crystal surface is very sparse and quite defective, which makes it more vulnerable to the penetration of various residues, particularly those with planar side chains such as Phe, Trp and Arg due to strong dispersion interactions, leading to subsequent protein unfolding. The binding free energy calculations for some key amino acids on the two different crystal surfaces further uncover the molecular origin behind their distinct protein denaturation capability.

Here, we constructed and characterized a full-length structural model of the T1R2-T1R3 receptor, including both the transmembrane (TM) and extracellular (EC) domains of the heterodimer, using comparative modeling and extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Several heterodimer interfaces were first examined for the TM domain, and conformational changes occurring at the intracellular side and associated with the receptor's activation were characterized.

Molecular dynamics simulations using the core amyloidogenic segment (KLVFFA) of Aβ peptide revealed that lanosterol exhibits at least two types of inhibition mechanism on the self-assembly of Aβ peptides. First, lanosterol entangles with peptides and forms a hydrophobic core with residues Phe-19 and Phe-20 in particular. Second, it interferes with the steric zipper interaction at the β-sheet-β-sheet interface. These simulation data suggest that lanosterol induces the unfolding of the Aβ peptide and the separation of the β-sheet layers.

The cell toxicity assay also showed that the treatment of lanosterol indeed mitigates the cytotoxicity of the Aβ peptide in PC-12 cells.

One stabilization strategy is to perform specific mutations in human antibodies based on highly stable antibodies in other species. To identify the key residues for mutagenesis, it is necessary to understand the roles of these residues in stabilizing the antibody. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the molecular origin of the four shark immunoglobulin new antigen receptors constant domains (C1-C4). According to the unfolding pathways and the conformational free energy surfaces in 8 M urea at 380 K, the C2 domain is the most stable, followed by C4, C1, and C3, which agrees with the experimental findings. The C1 and C3 domains follow a common unfolding pathway in which the unfolding starts from the edge strands, particularly strand g, and then gradually progresses to the inner strands. Detailed structural analysis of the C2 domain reveals a ""sandwich-like"" R339-E322-R341 salt-bridge cluster on strand g, which grants ultrahigh stability to the C2 domain. We further design two sets of mutations by mutating E322 to alanine or setting all atomic charges in E322 to zero to break the salt-bridge cluster in the C2 domain, which confirms the importance of the salt bridges in stability. In the C4 domain, the D80-K104 salt bridge on strand g also strengthens the stability. On the other hand, in the C1 and C3 domains, there is no salt bridge on strand g. In addition to the salt bridges, the overall hydrophobicity score of the hydrophobic core is also positively correlated with the domain stability. Our findings provide a detailed microscopic picture of the molecular origin of the four shark immunoglobulin new antigen receptors constant domains that not only explains the differences in their structural stability but also provides important insights into future antibody design.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4770a0705bed97eb038ff18d0a7bb2f9abe988ee,A detailed microscopic picture of the molecular origin of the four shark immunoglobulin new antigen receptors constant domains is provided that not only explains the differences in their structural stability but also provides important insights into future antibody design.,H.

Ideally, 99TcO4 - should be removed at the first stage, when the used fuel rods are dissolved in highly concentrated nitric acid solution, which can substantially reduce its interference with the solvent extraction process through catalytic redox reactions with the key actinides and diminish the chance of discharge into the environment as the volatile species during the waste vitrification process. However, this task cannot be achieved by any of the reported anion-scavenging materials including traditional polymeric anion-exchange resins, inorganic cationic framework materials, and recently developed cationic metal-organic framework materials, because they either are not stable under the extreme conditions of the combined high acidity and strong radiation field or do not possess the required uptake selectivity towards 99TcO4 - in the presence of a huge excess of competing anions such as NO3 - and SO4 2-.

Remarkably, we found that triangular nanopores possess excellent rectifications of ionic currents while hexagonal ones do not. It is worth highlighting that the pore length is only about 0.7 nm, which is about the atomic limit for a bipolar diode. We determined scaling relations between ionic currents I and pore sizes L for small nanopores, that are I ∼ L1 in a forward biasing voltage and I ∼ L2 in a reverse biasing voltage.

Consistent with previous experimental findings, our FEP results confirmed that non-native ligands, PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, show significant loss in binding affinity as a result of the substantial shift from the native binding mode and unfavorable local solvation environment. However, surprisingly, the underlying molecular pictures for the unfavorable binding of both ligands are quite distinctive: for PI(3,4)P2, it is due to a direct destabilization in the bound state, whereas for PI(3,4,5)P3, it is due to a relative stabilization in its free state.

Recently, in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that lanosterol, a steroid-type compound found in human and animal eyes, can not only prevent cataract formation but also reverse the formation. Inspired by these experimental observations, we investigate the preventive activity of lanosterol in the aggregate formation of human γD-crystallins (HγD-Crys) using all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and free energy perturbation (FEP) techniques. Our results reveal that lanosterol preferentially binds to the HγD-Crys hydrophobic dimerization interface, in particular, to the structured C-terminus (near residues 135-165) with a stronger binding affinity than the unfolded N-terminus. Furthermore, we observe that the C-terminal binding is more favorable than lanosterol self-aggregation, further attesting to lanosterol's efficacy.

Chowell et al. asked whether germline HLA-I genotype influences how T cells recognize tumor peptides and respond to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies (see the Perspective by Kvistborg and Yewdell). They examined more than 1500 patients and found that heterozygosity at HLA-I loci was associated with better survival than homozygosity for one or more HLA-I genes.

However, little is known about its interactions with biological systems at the atomic level, which intimately relates to the biocompatibility of the material. To provide insights into the effects of MoS2 in biological entities, we investigated the interactions of MoS2 with proteins from a functionally important membrane family, the ubiquitous potassium (K+) channels. Here, we study four representative K+ channels-KcsA, Kir3.2, the Kv1.2 paddle chimera, and K2P2-to investigate their interactions with a triangular MoS2 nanoflake using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations combined with electrophysiology experiments. These particular K+ channels were selected based on the diversity in their structure; that is, although these K+ channels display similar structural motifs, they also contain significant differences related to their particular function. Our results indicate that the MoS2 nanoflake is able to stably bind to three out of the four channels, albeit through distinct binding modes. The binding mode between each channel and MoS2 underlies the specific deleterious influence on the channel's basic physiological function: For KcsA, MoS2 binds on the extracellular loops, which indirectly destroys the delicate structure of the selectivity filter causing a strong leak of K+ ions. In the binding mode with Kir3.2, the MoS2 nanoflake completely covers the entrance to the channel pore affecting the normal ion conduction. For the Kv1.2 chimera, the MoS2 nanoflake prefers to bind into a crevice located at the extracellular side of the Voltage Sensor Domain (VSD). Interestingly, the crevice involves the N-terminal segment of S4, a crucial transmembrane helix which directly controls the gating process of the Kv1.2 chimera channel by electromechanical coupling the VSD to the transmembrane electric field. MoS2 in contact with S4 from the Kv1.2 chimera, potentially influences the channel's gating process from open to closed states. In all three systems, the van der Waals contribution to the total energy dominates the binding interactions; also, hydrophobic residues contribute the most contact points, which agrees with the strong hydrophobic character of the MoS2 nanomaterial. Electrophysiology recordings using two-electrode voltage-clamp show that currents of Kir3.2 and Kv1.2 are both blocked by the MoS2 nanoflakes in a concentration-dependent way. While the background K+ channel, K2P2 (TREK-1), identified as a negative control, is not blocked by the MoS2 nanoflakes. The large and rigid extracellular domain of K2P2 appears to protect the channel from disturbance by the nanoflakes. Intrinsic chemical properties of MoS2, together with the specific features of the channels, such as the electrostatic character and complex surface architecture, determine the critical details of the binding events. These findings might shed light on the potential nanotoxicology of MoS2 nanomaterials and help us to understand the underlying molecular mechanism.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/da031c1a9fc8a65aa85e67c3ba917aad9ebe9d23,"This work investigates the interactions of MoS2 with proteins from a functionally important membrane family, the ubiquitous potassium (K+) channels to shed light on the potential nanotoxicology ofMoS2 nanomaterials and help to understand the underlying molecular mechanism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two representative MoS2 NTs, (12, 12) and (6, 6), are considered in our present study. MoS2 NTs are found to effectively attract hydrogen and methane molecules through their surface and interior. Under storage conditions (175 K and 10 MPa), the storage capacity of methane in MoS2 NTs can reach 7–8 wt%, depending on the diameter of MoS2 NTs. For hydrogen, the storage capacity is around 0.7–0.9 wt%. The gas weight percentage is linearly dependent on the environmental pressure from 10 MPa to 1 MPa at constant temperature. Meanwhile, adsorption demonstrates an exponential relationship with the system temperature from 175 K to 425 K when pressure is maintained constant. Dynamic pressure simulations reveal that up to 80–90% of the stored gases can be spontaneously released as the pressure decreases from 10 MPa to 1 MPa, with methane slightly more efficient than hydrogen, indicating high cyclic storage performance.

Interestingly, once bound to the C2N monolayer, the transverse mobility of the dsDNA is highly restricted. Further energetic and structural analyses reveal that the strength and position of the binding is guided by the favorable π-π stacking between the dsDNA terminal base pairs and the benzene rings on the C2N surface, accompanied by a simultaneous strong nanoscale dewetting that provides additional driving forces. The periodic atomic charge distributions on C2N (from its unique porous structure) also cause the formation of local highly dense first solvation shell water clusters, which act as further steric hindrance for the dsDNA migration.

Although several strategies have been established for detecting uranyl ions in water, searching for new uranium sensor material with great sensitivity, selectivity, and stability remains a challenge. We introduce here a hydrolytically stable mesoporous terbium(III)-based MOF material compound 1, whose channels are as large as 27 Å × 23 Å and are equipped with abundant exposed Lewis basic sites, the luminescence intensity of which can be efficiently and selectively quenched by uranyl ions. The detection limit in deionized water reaches 0.9 μg/L, far below the maximum contamination standard of 30 μg/L in drinking water defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, making compound 1 currently the only MOF material that can achieve this goal. More importantly, this material exhibits great capability in detecting uranyl ions in natural water systems such as lake water and seawater with pH being adjusted to 4, where huge excesses of competing ions are present. The uranyl detection limits in Dushu Lake water and in seawater were calculated to be 14.0 and 3.5 μg/L, respectively. This great detection capability originates from the selective binding of uranyl ions onto the Lewis basic sites of the MOF material, as demonstrated by synchrotron radiation extended X-ray adsorption fine structure, X-ray adsorption near edge structure, and first principles calculations, further leading to an effective energy transfer between the uranyl ions and the MOF skeleton.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30a96588211ba877e2d36ec64651892da722e062,"A hydrolytically stable mesoporous terbium(III)-based MOF material compound 1 is introduced, whose channels are as large as 27 Å × 23 Å and are equipped with abundant exposed Lewis basic sites, the luminescence intensity of which can be efficiently and selectively quenched by uranyl ions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, MoS2 has gained attention in the biomedical field because of its ability to act as an antibacterial and anticancer agent. However, the potential influence of this exciting nanomaterial on biomolecules is yet to be extensively studied. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are invaluable tools in the examination of protein interactions with nanomaterials such as MoS2. Previous protein MD studies have employed MoS2 force field parameters which were developed to accurately model bulk crystal structures and thermal heat transport but may not necessarily be amendable to its properties at the interface with biomolecules. By adopting a newly developed MoS2 force field, which was designed to better capture its interaction with water and proteins, we have examined the changes in protein structures between the original and refitted MoS2 force field parameters of three representative proteins, polyalanine (α-helix), YAP65 WW-domains (β-sheet), and HP35 (globular protein) when adsorbed onto MoS2 nanomaterials. We find that the original force field, with much larger van der Waals (vdW) contributions, resulted in more dramatic protein structural damage than the refitted parameters. Importantly, some denaturation of the protein tertiary structure and the local secondary structure persisted with the refitted force field albeit overall less severe MoS2 denaturation capacity was found. This work suggests that the denaturation ability of MoS2 to the protein structure is not as dire as previously reported and provides noteworthy findings on the dynamic interactions of proteins with this emergent material.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a36e4b573d0cf745baac8e3e4ee04b21aaabf98,This work suggests that the denaturation ability of MoS2 to the protein structure is not as dire as previously reported and provides noteworthy findings on the dynamic interactions of proteins with this emergent material.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction of a MoS2 nanosheet with Villin Headpiece (HP35), a model protein widely used in protein folding studies. We find that MoS2 exhibits robust denaturing capability to HP35, with its secondary structures severely destroyed within hundreds of nanosecond simulations. Both aromatic and basic residues are critical for the protein anchoring onto MoS2 surface, which then triggers the successive protein unfolding process. The main driving force behind the adsorption process is the dispersion interaction between protein and MoS2 monolayer. Moreover, water molecules at the interface between some key hydrophobic residues (e.g. Trp-64) and MoS2 surface also help to accelerate the process driven by nanoscale drying, which provides a strong hydrophobic force.

To analyze the characteristics of methane hydrate (MH) dissociation and evaluate the gas production during the application of different MH decomposition methods, this study firstly compared MH dissociation during depressurization, thermal stimulation, and combined method (depressurization + thermal stimulation) treatments using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in situ observation. In particular, the influences of back-pressure and temperature on hydrate dissociation, the hydrate saturation, the rate of hydrate dissociation and MRI images from each of the three methods were investigated. The results proved that during application of the depressurization and combined methods at different back-pressures (2.2–2.6 MPa), the MH dissociation proceeded via radial dissociation rather than axial dissociation; moreover, during the application of the thermal stimulation method at different dissociation temperatures (278.15–288.15 K), the MH dissociated uniformly. Overall, a combination of depressurization and thermal stimulation at the initial stage of hydrate decomposition was proposed and comparison of the three methods demonstrated that the combined method had obvious advantages for methane treatment. Specifically, the combined method was capable of solving the problems related to low gas production and poor energy efficiency that were encountered when using either the depressurization or thermal stimulation method alone.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e354004646d5bb492875e89c64d2de4339c2afc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction of a MoS2 nanotube with YAP65 WW domain, a mostly antiparallel β-sheet model protein widely used in molecular simulations. We find that YAP65 loses most of its secondary and tertiary structures within a few hundred nanoseconds after adsorbing onto the MoS2 nanotube surface, indicating that the MoS2 nanotube displays significant structural damage to YAP65.

It is highly desired to have great permeability, selectivity and controllability in the desalination performance of these nanopores. However, it is still a challenge to achieve all three features in one material or device. Here, we demonstrate efficient and controllable water desalination with a nanoporous 2D Fe phthalocyanine (FePc) membrane using molecular dynamics simulations. We find the FePc membrane not only conducts fast water flow, but it also suppresses ion permeation. The selectivity is attributed to a mechanism distinct from the traditional steric exclusion: cations are excluded due to electrostatic repulsion, whereas anions can be trapped in the nanopore and induce the reorganization of ions in the vicinity of the nanopore, which in turn creates a tendency for the trapped anions to move back into the saline reservoir. More interestingly, we find such mechanism is largely due to the sufficiently strong electrostatic interaction of the charged nanopore region with ions and is not restricted to the FePc nanopore. In addition, the number of protonated nitrogen atoms in FePc pores can be modulated by adjusting the pH value of the solution. The extent of the anion occupancy can thus be regulated, giving rise to control of the water flow. Taken together, great permeability, selectivity and controllability can be achieved with this nanosheet system.

In recent decades, desalination methods have improved via water-filtering architectures based on nanoporous graphene filters and artificial membranes integrated with biological water channels. Here, we report the auspicious performance (in simulations) of an alternative nanoporous desalination filter constructed from a MoS2 nanosheet. In striking contrast to graphene-based filters, we find that the ""open"" and ""closed"" states of the MoS2 filter can be regulated by the introduction of mechanical strain, yielding a highly tunable nanopore interface. By applying lateral strain to the MoS2 filter in our simulations, we see that the transition point between ""open"" and ""closed"" states occurs under tension that induces about 6% cross-sectional expansion in the membrane (6% strain); the open state of the MoS2 filter demonstrates high water transparency and a strong salt filtering capability even under 12% strain.

The structure of water on transverse stretched phosphorene is demonstrated to be different from that on longitudinal stretched phosphorene. Moreover, the contact angle of water on strained phosphorene is proportional to the quotient of the longitudinal and transverse diffusion coefficients of the interfacial water.

Strikingly, the structure of such complex is quite unique: hydrophobic side-chains extend over the graphene surface and interact with adjacent peptides, yielding a well-defined mosaic of hydrophobic interaction patches. This ordered structure is markedly depleted of backbone hydrogen bonds. Hence, our simulation results reveal a distinct type of β-strand assembly, maintained by hydrophobic side-chain interactions.

Often anchored by thiol groups, such peptide coronae not only serve as passivators but can also endow AuNCs with additional bioactive properties. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the structure of a tridecapeptide-coated Au25 cluster and its subsequent interactions with the enzyme thioredoxin reductase 1, TrxR1. We find that, in isolation, both the distribution and conformation of the coating peptides fluctuate considerably. When the coated AuNC is placed around TrxR1, however, the motion of the highly charged peptide coating (+5e/peptide) is quickly biased by electrostatic attraction to the protein; the asymmetric coating acts to guide the nanocluster's diffusion toward the enzyme's negatively charged active site. After the AuNC comes into contact with TrxR1, its peptide corona spreads over the protein surface to facilitate stable binding with protein. Though individual salt bridge interactions between the tridecapeptides and TrxR1 are transient in nature, the cooperative binding of the peptide-coated AuNC is very stable, overall. Interestingly, the biased corona peptide motion, the spreading and the cooperation between peptide extensions observed in AuNC binding are reminiscent of bacterial stimulus-driven approaching and adhesion mechanisms mediated by cilia. The prevailing AuNC binding mode we characterize also satisfies a notable hydrophobic interaction seen in the association of thioredoxin to TrxR1, providing a possible explanation for the AuNC binding specificity observed in experiments.

We characterize the TSEs for Protein G and NuG2b, a triple mutant of NuG2, using ψ analysis, a method for identifying contacts in the TSE. All three homologs are found to share a common and near-native TSE topology with interactions between all four strands.

In this work, we couple Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations with fluorescence spectroscopy experiments to characterize this curvature dependence in detail for the model protein bovine serum albumin (BSA). By studying BSA adsorption onto carbon nanotubes of increasing radius (featuring descending local curvatures) and a flat graphene sheet, we confirm that adsorption capacity is indeed enhanced on flatter surfaces. Naïve fluorescence experiments featuring multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), however, conform to an opposing trend. To reconcile these observations, we conduct additional MD simulations with MWCNTs that match those prepared in experiments; such simulations indicate that increased mass to surface area ratios in multi-walled systems explain the observed discrepancies.

In this study, structural stability and interactions of cellulase cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) in ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [Bmim]Cl) solution were investigated through computer simulations. At a moderately low concentration (0.8 M) of [Bmim]Cl, the cellulase CBHI showed both thermostability and IL-resistance at room temperature as well as a higher temperature of 350 K. However, several [Bmim]+ cations were found to be able to intrude into the interior of cellulase, especially near the cellulose binding tunnel and the active site for hydrolysis. These [Bmim]+ can compete with the binding of the cellulose substrate and directly block the hydrolysis pathway, which are responsible for the cellulase inactivation found in experiments. Three important residues, H228, W376 and R251, are identified to potentially improve the IL-resistance on cellulase. Motivated by the experiment, in silico mutagenesis studies of H228R have been conducted to examine the IL binding at the active site, in which the binding affinity of [Bmim]+ in the mutant is significantly reduced, by 20%, as compared to the wild type due to the repulsive interactions from the new arginine residue.

In this work we show that there is a related process in which water molecules move (""shuttle"") through a hydrated excess proton charge defect in order to wet the path ahead for subsequent proton charge migration. This process is illustrated through reactive molecular dynamics simulations of proton transport through a hydrophobic nanotube, which penetrates through a hydrophobic region. Surprisingly, before the proton enters the nanotube, it starts ""shooting"" water molecules into the otherwise dry space via Grotthuss shuttling, effectively creating its own water wire where none existed before. As the proton enters the nanotube (by 2-3 Å), it completes the solvation process, transitioning the nanotube to the fully wet state. By contrast, other monatomic cations (e.g., K(+)) have just the opposite effect, by blocking the wetting process and making the nanotube even drier. As the dry nanotube gradually becomes wet when the proton charge defect enters it, the free energy barrier of proton permeation through the tube via Grotthuss shuttling drops significantly. This finding suggests that an important wetting mechanism may influence proton translocation in biological systems, i.e., one in which protons ""create"" their own water structures (water ""wires"") in hydrophobic spaces (e.g., protein pores) before migrating through them.

The use of molecular dynamics as the fundamental driver of the sampling requires the introduction of a time step whose magnitude is limited by the fastest motions in a system. While standard multiple time-stepping methods allow larger time steps to be employed for the slower and computationally more expensive forces, the maximum achievable increase in time step is limited by resonance phenomena, which inextricably couple fast and slow motions. Recently, we introduced deterministic and stochastic resonance-free multiple time step algorithms for molecular dynamics that solve this resonance problem and allow ten- to twenty-fold gains in the large time step compared to standard multiple time step algorithms [P.

The combination of resonance-free multiple time step integrators with free-energy-based enhanced sampling significantly improves the efficiency of conformational exploration.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28726c2cecab219d2e952fdf52790b565c81b09c,,PY.

Despite the broad interest to understand, at the molecular level, the functional state of Cx-based channels, there are still many unanswered questions regarding structure-function relationships, perm-selectivity, and gating mechanisms.

Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize hCx26 internal water structure and dynamics, six IC pockets were identified per hemichannel.

A robust linear relationship is achieved with this nano-turbine between its rotation rate and the fluid flow velocity spanning two orders of magnitude, and this linear relationship remains intact at various temperatures. More interestingly, a striking difference from its macroscopic counterpart is identified: the rotation rate is much smaller (by a factor of ~15) than that of the macroscopic turbine with the same driving flow.

In this paper, we used first-principles density functional theory (DFT) to illustrate the adsorption and interactions between U atoms and the inner/outer surfaces of a single-walled carbon nanotube. Our DFT calculations showed that when U atoms were adsorbed on each of the CNT surfaces, the ground electronic states were all quintet. However, U atoms showed differential adsorption modes depending on the surface, binding to bridge sites on the inner surface, and to hole sites on the outer surface. The interior adsorption was more stable with an interaction energy of about 1 eV greater than that of the external one, which is explained by their different ground state electronic structures. The electronic states were largely influenced by the ferromagnetic coupling between the U atoms and the net spintronics of the CNT only for the internal adsorption case, with the external adsorption mainly determined by the U atoms. Orbital and charge analysis show that compared to the external adsorption, there were about 1.0e more charge transfers between the internally adsorbed U atom and the CNT, which facilitated stronger donor–acceptor interactions. Further analysis on the density of states indicated that the internal adsorption had a larger bonding area between the U atoms and CNT, supporting the stronger internal adsorption.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45ae9e7ba9730b6307bbbd3a1c4f57d3a159712c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The carbon-based nanomaterials and noble metal nanoparticles are the main focus, with additional discussions on quantum dots and other nanoparticles as well. The driving forces for adsorption of fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene nanosheets onto proteins or cell membranes are found to be mainly hydrophobic interactions and the so-called π-π stacking (between aromatic rings), while for the noble metal nanoparticles the long-range electrostatic interactions play a bigger role. More interestingly, there are also growing evidences showing that nanotoxicity can have implications in de novo design of nanomedicine.

Owing to their size-dependent properties and controlled nanostructures, quantum dots (QDs) exhibit distinct optical and electronic characteristics. However, QDs include heavy metals and often require stabilizing agents which are toxic for biological applications. Here, to mitigate the use of toxic ligands, cadmium selenide quantum dots (CdSe QDs) were synthesized in situ with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) at room temperature. The addition of PVP polymer provided size regulation, stability, and control over size distribution of CdSe QDs. The characterization of the optical properties of the CdSe QDs was performed using fluorescence and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. CdSe QDs exhibited a typical absorbance peak at 280 nm and a photoluminescence emission peak at 580 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs demonstrated that CdSe QDs having an average size of 6 ± 4 nm were obtained via wet chemistry method. CdSe QDs were immobilized in a blend of PVP and poly(L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PL-b-CL) copolymer that was electrospun to produce nanofibers. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal analyses and attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) were used to characterize properties of fabricated nanofibers. Both pristine and hybrid nanofibers possessed cylindrical geometry and rough surface features, facilitating increased surface area. Infrared absorption spectra showed a slight shift in absorbance peaks due to interaction of PVP-coated CdSe QDs and nanofiber matrix. The presence of CdSe QDs influenced the fiber diameter and their thermal stability.

Despite many studies on drugs targeting the mGluR receptors to date, the molecular level details on the ligand binding dynamics still remain unclear. In this study, we performed in silico experiments for mGluR1 with 29 different ligands including known synthetic agonists and antagonists as well as natural amino acids. The ligand-receptor binding affinities were estimated by the use of atomistic simulations combined with the mathematically rigorous, Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) method, which successfully recognized the native agonist l-glutamate among the highly favorable binders, and also accurately distinguished antagonists from agonists. Comparative contact analysis also revealed the binding mode differences between natural and non-natural amino acid-based ligands. Several factors potentially affecting the ligand binding affinity and specificity were identified including net charges, dipole moments, and the presence of aromatic rings.

Understanding these differences is crucial because such configurations serve as starting points of folding studies, and thus can affect both the folding mechanism and the kinetics. Here we provide a detailed comparison of both chemically induced and force-induced unfolded state ensembles of ubiquitin based on extensive, all-atom simulations of the protein either extended by force or denatured by urea. As expected, the respective unfolded states are very different on a macromolecular scale, being fully extended under force with no contacts and partially extended in urea with many nonnative contacts. The amount of residual secondary structure also differs: A significant population of α-helices is found in chemically denatured configurations but such helices are absent under force, except at the lowest applied force of 30 pN where short helices form transiently. We see that typical-size helices are unstable above this force, and β-sheets cannot form. More surprisingly, we observe striking differences in the backbone dihedral angle distributions for the protein unfolded under force and the one unfolded by denaturant. A simple model based on the dialanine peptide is shown to not only provide an explanation for these striking differences but also illustrates how the force dependence of the protein dihedral angle distributions give rise to the worm-like chain behavior of the chain upon force.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e98fa2a91b04f8fd403e5551a26cc930d225bea,"A detailed comparison of both chemically induced and force-induced unfolded state ensembles of ubiquitin based on extensive, all-atom simulations of the protein either extended by force or denatured by urea is provided.",G.

Recent experimental studies have shown that triphenylalanine(FFF)-based peptides can self-assemble into solid plate-like nanostructures and nanospheres, which are different from the hollow nanovesicles and nanotubes formed by diphenylalanine(FF)-based peptides. In spite of extensive studies, the assembly mechanism and the molecular basis for the structural differences between FFF and FF nanostructures remain poorly understood. In this work, we first investigate the assembly process and the structural features of FFF nanostructures using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, and then compare them with FF nanostructures. We find that FFF peptides spontaneously assemble into solid nanometer-sized nanospheres and nanorods with substantial β-sheet contents, consistent with the structural properties of hundred-nanometer-sized FFF nano-plates characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy. Distinct from the formation mechanism of water-filled FF nanovesicles and nanotubes reported in our previous study, intermediate bilayers are not observed during the self-assembly process of FFF nanospheres and nanorods. The peptides in FFF nanostructures are predominantly anti-parallel-aligned, which can form larger sizes of β-sheet-like structures than the FF counterparts. In contrast, FF peptides exhibit lipid-like assembly behavior and assemble into bilayered nanostructures. Furthermore, although the self-assembly of FF and FFF peptides is mostly driven by side chain-side chain (SC-SC) aromatic stacking interactions, the main chain-main chain (MC-MC) interactions also play an important role in the formation of fine structures of the assemblies. The delicate interplay between MC-MC and SC-SC interactions results in the different nanostructures formed by the two peptides.

The aromatic residues within the duplicated Greek key domains of γ- and β-crystallins are the main ultraviolet absorbers and are susceptible to direct and indirect ultraviolet damage. The previous site-directed mutagenesis studies have revealed a striking difference for two highly conserved homologous β-hairpin Tyr pairs, at the N-terminal domain (N-td) and C-terminal domain (C-td), respectively, in their contribution to the overall stability of HγD-Crys, but why they behave so differently still remains a mystery. In this paper, we systematically investigated the underlying molecular mechanism and detailed contributions of these two Tyr pairs with large scale molecular dynamics simulations. A series of different tyrosine-to-alanine pair(s) substitutions were performed in either the N-td, the C-td, or both. Our results suggest that the Y45A/Y50A pair substitution in the N-td mainly affects the stability of the N-td itself, while the Y133A/Y138A pair substitution in the C-td leads to a more cooperative unfolding of both N-td and C-td. The stability of motif 2 in the N-td is mainly determined by the interdomain interface, while motif 1 in the N-td or motifs 3 and 4 in the C-td are mainly stabilized by the intradomain hydrophobic core. The damage to any tyrosine pair(s) can directly introduce some apparent water leakage to the hydrophobic core at the interface, which in turn causes a serious loss in the stability of the N-td. However, for the C-td substitutions, it may further impair the stable ""sandwich-like"" Y133-R167-Y138 cluster (through cation-π interactions) in the wild-type, thus causing the loop regions near the residue A138 to undergo large fluctuations, which in turn results in the intrusion of water into the hydrophobic core of the C-td and induces the C-td to lose its stability. These findings help resolve the ""mystery"" on why these two Tyr pairs display such a striking difference in their contributions to the overall protein stability despite their highly homologous nature.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ccb283b02cd96cae8581b788d8b7c62280623d8e,"This paper systematically investigated the underlying molecular mechanism and detailed contributions of these two Tyr pairs with large scale molecular dynamics simulations, and suggests that the Y45A/Y50A pair substitution in the N-td mainly affects the stability of theN-td itself, while the Y133A/y138A pair replacement in the C-td leads to a more cooperative unfolding of both N-TD and C-TD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our atomistic molecular dynamics simulations then reveal that these individual layers have very different internal nanostructures, with parallel β-sheets in the first monolayer but antiparallel β-sheets in the subsequent upper layers due to their different microenvironment.

Unexpectedly, the existence of a small amount of ethanol molecules promotes the dewetting transition in the inter-plate region at a greater separation that is otherwise non-existent in pure water or pure ethanol. We find that a competition for ethanol molecules at equilibrium among the inter-plate region, the outer-surfaces of the plates and the bulk solution results in a depletion of ethanol molecules in the inter-plate region. Meanwhile, the preferred inward orientations of the ethanol ethyl groups at the liquid–vapor interface located at the edge of the plates make the inter-plate core more hydrophobic so that water molecules are more favored to be expelled, thus resulting in an enhancement of the dewetting.

Owing to their well-defined one-dimensional (1D) interior, CNTs serve as desirable materials for encapsulating molecules, such as water [1-4], ionic liquid [5], drug molecules [6], and biomolecules [7]. The nanoscale confinement of CNTs have considerable impact on the inner molecules, including changes in their structure, size distribution, surface area, and dynamics, thus leading to many interesting and striking properties that are quite different from those in bulk [1-5, 7-9]. For example, nanoscale confinement of CNTs can give rise to ordered structure and extra-fast motion of water molecules [1-4], significantly enhanced ac‐ tivity of catalytic particles [8], phase transition of ionic liquids from liquid to high-meltingpoint crystal [5], and denatured structures of peptide helices [9]. In particular, recent studies [10-13] have shown that these CNT-based nanomaterials can be used as a new paradigm of diagnostic and therapeutic tools, which is beyond the traditional organic chemistry based therapeutics in the current pharmacology. Before their wide applications in the biomedical filed, the effects of CNTs on biomolecules (and drug molecules) need to be understood thor‐ oughly [14-20].",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dd2eaa2bf5628bc78ae5f3a9007245c1ee9ae727,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a synergistic simulation-experimental approach on the αTS TIM barrel protein, we validated this hypothesis by revealing the occurrence of drying inside hydrophobic amino acid clusters and its manifestation in experimental measures of protein stability and structure. Cavities created within three clusters of branched aliphatic amino acids [isoleucine, leucine, and valine (ILV) clusters] were found to experience strong water density fluctuations or intermittent dewetting transitions in simulations. Individually substituting 10 residues in the large ILV cluster at the N-terminus with less hydrophobic alanines showed a weakening or diminishing effect on dewetting that depended on the site of the mutation. Our simulations also demonstrated that replacement of buried leucines with isosteric, polar asparagines enhanced the wetting of the N- and C-terminal clusters. The experimental results on the stability, secondary structure, and compactness of the native and intermediate states for the asparagine variants are consistent with the preferential drying of the large N-terminal cluster in the intermediate. By contrast, the region encompassing the small C-terminal cluster experiences only partial drying in the intermediate, and its structure and stability are unaffected by the asparagine substitution. Surprisingly, the structural distortions required to accommodate the replacement of leucine by asparagine in the N-terminal cluster revealed the existence of alternative stable folds in the native basin.

To achieve single-base resolution of DNA sequencing, it is critical to slow and control the translocation of DNA, which has been achieved in a protein nanopore but not yet in a solid-state nanopore. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the dynamics of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecule in an aqueous glycerol solution confined in a SiO2 nanopore. The friction coefficient ξ of the ssDNA molecule is found to be approximately 18 times larger in glycerol than in water, which can dramatically slow the motion of ssDNA. The electrophoretic mobility μ of ssDNA in glycerol, however, decreases by almost the same factor, yielding the effective charge (ξμ) of ssDNA being roughly the same as in water. This is counterintuitive since the ssDNA effective charge predicted from the counterion condensation theory varies with the dielectric constant of a solvent. Due to the larger friction coefficient of ssDNA in glycerol, we further show that glycerol can improve trapping of ssDNA in the DNA transistor, a nanodevice that can be used to control the motion of ssDNA in a solid-state nanopore.

Most of the new drugs reaching the market today are single enantiomers, rather than racemic mixtures. However, many optically pure drugs, including thalidomide, undergo enantiomerization in vivo, thus negating the single enantiomers' benefits or inducing unexpected effects. A detailed atomic level understanding of chiral conversion, which is still largely lacking, is thus critical for drug development. Herein, we use first-principle density function theory (DFT) to explore the mechanism of enantiomerization of thalidomide. We have identified the two most plausible interconversion pathways for isolated thalidomide: 1) proton transfer from the chiral carbon center to an adjacent carbonyl oxygen atom, followed by isomerization and rotation of the glutarimide ring (before the proton hops back to the chiral carbon atom); and 2) a pathway that is the same as ""1"", but with the isomerization of the glutarimide ring occurring ahead of the initial proton transfer reaction. There are two remarkable energy barriers, 73.29 and 23.59 kcal mol(-1), corresponding to the proton transfer and the rotation of the glutarimide ring, respectively. Furthermore, we found that water effectively catalyzes the interconversion by facilitating the proton transfer with the highest energy barrier falling to approximately 30 kcal mol(-1), which, to our knowledge, is the first time that this important role of water in chiral conversion has been demonstrated. Finally, we show that the hydroxide ion can further lower the enantiomerization energy barrier to approximately 24 kcal mol(-1) by facilitating proton abstraction, which agrees well with recent experimental data under basic conditions. Our current findings highlight the importance of water and hydroxide ions in the enantiomerization of thalidomide and also provide new insights into the mechanism of enantiomerization at an atomic level.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c575ca474f415de29e26ec8854de60762e15155d,"This work uses first-principle density function theory (DFT) to explore the mechanism of enantiomerization of thalidomide and finds that water effectively catalyzes the interconversion by facilitating the proton transfer with the highest energy barrier falling to approximately 30 kcal mol(-1), which is the first time that this important role of water in chiral conversion has been demonstrated.",C.

Given that proteins generally adopt extended or unfolded conformations in either aqueous urea or GdmCl, one might expect that the unfolded protein chains will remain or become further extended due to the addition of another denaturant. However, a collapse of denatured proteins is revealed using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations when a mixture of denaturants is used. Both hen egg-white lysozyme and protein L are found to undergo collapse in the denaturant mixture. The collapse of the protein conformational ensembles is accompanied by a decreased solubility and increased non-native self-interactions of hydrophobic residues in the urea/GdmCl mixture. The increase of non-native interactions rather than the native contacts indicates that the proteins experience a simple collapse transition from the fully denatured states. During the protein collapse, the relatively stronger denaturant GdmCl displays a higher tendency to be absorbed onto the protein surface due to their stronger electrostatic interactions with proteins. At the same time, urea molecules also accumulate near the protein surface, resulting in an enhanced ""local crowding"" for the protein near its first solvation shell. This rearrangement of denaturants near the protein surface and crowded local environment induce the protein collapse, mainly by burying their hydrophobic residues. These findings from molecular simulations are then further explained by a simple analytical model based on statistical mechanics.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/de1540de26f02e631652e21e0134a327c33537c7,A collapse of denatured proteins is revealed using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations when a mixture of denaturants is used and is further explained by a simple analytical model based on statistical mechanics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have long been targeted as a potential anticancer therapy because of their seminal role in angiogenesis and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation of tumor survival and invasion. However, the inhibition specificity to MMPs and the molecular-level understanding of the inhibition mechanism remain largely unresolved. Here, we found that endohedral metallofullerenol Gd@C82(OH)22 can successfully inhibit the neoplastic activity with experiments at animal, tissue, and cellular levels. Gd@C82(OH)22 effectively blocks tumor growth in human pancreatic cancer xenografts in a nude mouse model. Enzyme activity assays also show Gd@C82(OH)22 not only suppresses the expression of MMPs but also significantly reduces their activities. We then applied large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations to illustrate the molecular mechanism by studying the Gd@C82(OH)22–MMP-9 interactions in atomic detail. Our data demonstrated that Gd@C82(OH)22 inhibits MMP-9 mainly via an exocite interaction, whereas the well-known zinc catalytic site only plays a minimal role. Steered by nonspecific electrostatic, hydrophobic, and specific hydrogen-bonding interactions, Gd@C82(OH)22 exhibits specific binding modes near the ligand-specificity loop S1′, thereby inhibiting MMP-9 activity. Both the suppression of MMP expression and specific binding mode make Gd@C82(OH)22 a potentially more effective nanomedicine for pancreatic cancer than traditional medicines, which usually target the proteolytic sites directly but fail in selective inhibition.

Here we perform large scale MD simulations of five representative protein/peptide systems in aqueous urea to investigate if the above mechanism is common to other proteins. In all cases, accumulations of urea around proteins/peptide are observed, suggesting that urea denatures proteins by directly attacking protein backbones and side chains rather than indirectly disrupting water structure as a ""water breaker"". Consistent with our previous case study of lysozyme, the current energetic analyses with five protein/peptide systems reveal that urea's preferential binding to proteins mainly comes from urea's stronger dispersion interactions with proteins than with bulk solution, whereas the electrostatic (hydrogen-bonded) interactions only play a relatively minor (even negative) role during this denaturation process. Furthermore, the simulations of the peptide system at different urea concentrations (8 and 4.5 M), and with different force fields (CHARMM and OPLSAA) suggest that the above mechanism is robust, independent of the urea concentration and force field used.

The addition of molybdenum to the system can increase the selectivity with regard to the number of walls that exist in the obtained CNTs. As reported herein, we have designed and synthesized a novel Co-Mo-MOF, [Co(3-bpta)1.5(MoO4)]·H2O (where 3-bpta = N,N'-bis(3-pyridyl)terephthalamide), and employed the Co-Mo-MOF as a bimetallic catalyst precursor for the CCVD approach to prepare high-quality DWCNTs.

Existing CoMoO4 is unaltered after reduction in H2 at 1100 °C, while CoO and MoO3 are converted into Co0 and MoO2, and more CoMoO4 is created at the expense of Co0 and MoO2 without clearly defining agglomeration. Finally, the interaction between metallic Co particles and C2H4 is what initiates the formation of DWCNTs. In-depth discussion is provided in this paper regarding the mechanism underlying the high selectivity and activity of Co-Mo catalysts in regulating the development and structure of DWCNTs.

Over the threshold energy, the water flow through N-DWCNT decreases monotonically with the strengthening of the water-nanotube interaction. The effect on the water flow across the channel is found to be negligible when the interaction energy is weaker than the threshold. The water-nanotube interaction energy can be controlled by doping nitrogen atoms into the nanotube walls. Although the van der Waals interaction energy is much stronger than the electrostatic interaction energy, it is less sensitive to the proportion of doped nitrogen atoms. On the other hand, the electrostatic interaction energy weakens after the initial strengthening when the percentage of doped nitrogen atoms increases to ~25%. The doped nitrogen atoms make less influence on the overall electrostatic interaction energy when the proportion is over 25%, due to the repulsions among themselves.

Recent experimental studies reported that diphenylalanine-based peptides can self-assemble into highly ordered nanostructures such as nanovesicles and nanotubes. However, the molecular mechanism of the self-organization of such well-defined nanoarchitectures remains elusive. In this study, we investigate the assembly pathway of 600 diphenylalanine (FF) peptides at different peptide concentrations by performing extensive coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Based on forty 0.6-1.8 μs trajectories at 310 K starting from random configurations, we find that FF dipeptides not only spontaneously assemble into spherical vesicles and nanotubes, consistent with previous experiments, but also form new ordered nanoarchitectures, namely, planar bilayers and a rich variety of other shapes of vesicle-like structures including toroid, ellipsoid, discoid, and pot-shaped vesicles. The assembly pathways are concentration-dependent. At low peptide concentrations, the self-assembly involves the fusion of small vesicles and bilayers, whereas at high concentrations, it occurs through the formation of a bilayer first, followed by the bending and closure of the bilayer. Energetic analysis suggests that the formation of different nanostructures is a result of the delicate balance between peptide-peptide and peptide-water interactions. Our all-atom MD simulation shows that FF nanostructures are stabilized by a combination of T-shaped aromatic stacking, interpeptide head-to-tail hydrogen-bonding, and peptide-water hydrogen-bonding interactions.

Here we propose a computational framework to study structural binding patterns and detailed molecular mechanisms of viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) binding with a broad spectrum of neutralizing monoclonal antibody fragments (Fab). We used rigorous free-energy perturbation (FEP) methods to calculate the antigen-antibody binding affinities, with an aggregate underlying molecular-dynamics simulation time of several microseconds (∼2 μs) using all-atom, explicit-solvent models. We achieved a high accuracy in the validation of our FEP protocol against a series of known binding affinities for this complex system, with <0.5 kcal/mol errors on average. We then introduced what to our knowledge are novel mutations into the interfacial region to further study the binding mechanism. We found that the stacking interaction between Trp-21 in HA2 and Phe-55 in the CDR-H2 of Fab is crucial to the antibody-antigen association. A single mutation of either W21A or F55A can cause a binding affinity decrease of ΔΔG > 4.0 kcal/mol (equivalent to an ∼1000-fold increase in the dissociation constant K(d)). Moreover, for group 1 HA subtypes (which include both the H1N1 swine flu and the H5N1 bird flu), the relative binding affinities change only slightly (< ±1 kcal/mol) when nonpolar residues at the αA helix of HA mutate to conservative amino acids of similar size, which explains the broad neutralization capability of antibodies such as F10 and CR6261. Finally, we found that the hydrogen-bonding network between His-38 (in HA1) and Ser-30/Gln-64 (in Fab) is important for preserving the strong binding of Fab against group 1 HAs, whereas the lack of such hydrogen bonds with Asn-38 in most group 2 HAs may be responsible for the escape of antibody neutralization.

Some recent experiments have suggested that the π-π stacking interactions between protein's aromatic residues and CNTs might play a key role in their binding, which raises interest in large scale modeling of protein-CNT complexes and associated π-π interactions at atomic detail. However, there is concern on the accuracy of classical fixed-charge molecular force fields due to their classical treatments and lack of polarizability. Here, we study the binding of three aromatic residue analogues (mimicking phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) and benzene to a single-walled CNT, and compare the molecular mechanical (MM) calculations using three popular fixed-charge force fields (OPLSAA, AMBER, and CHARMM), with quantum mechanical (QM) calculations using the density-functional tight-binding method with the inclusion of dispersion correction (DFTB-D). Two typical configurations commonly found in π-π interactions are used, one with the aromatic rings parallel to the CNT surface (flat), and the other perpendicular (edge). Our calculations reveal that compared to the QM results the MM approaches can appropriately reproduce the strength of π-π interactions for both configurations, and more importantly, the energy difference between them, indicating that the various contributions to π-π interactions have been implicitly included in the van der Waals parameters of the standard MM force fields. Meanwhile, these MM models are less accurate in predicting the exact structural binding patterns (matching surface), meaning there are still rooms to be improved.

The urea wire is structurally ordered, both translationally and orientationally, with a contiguous hydrogen-bonded network and concerted urea's dipole orientations.

Identification of the γ-crystallin precursors to aggregates is crucial for developing strategies to prevent and reverse cataract. Our microseconds of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations uncover the molecular structure of the experimentally detected aggregation-prone folding intermediate species of monomeric native γD-crystallin with a largely folded C-terminal domain and a mostly unfolded N-terminal domain. About 30 residues including a, b, and c strands from the Greek Key motif 4 of the C-terminal domain experience strong solvent exposure of hydrophobic residues as well as partial unstructuring upon N-terminal domain unfolding. Those strands comprise the domain-domain interface crucial for unusually high stability of γD-crystallin. We further simulate the intermolecular linkage of these monomeric aggregation precursors, which reveals domain-swapped dimeric structures. In the simulated dimeric structures, the N-terminal domain of one monomer is frequently found in contact with residues 135-164 encompassing the a, b, and c strands of the Greek Key motif 4 of the second molecule. The present results suggest that γD-crystallin may polymerize through successive domain swapping of those three C-terminal β-strands leading to age-onset cataract, as an evolutionary cost of its very high stability. Alanine substitutions of the hydrophobic residues in those aggregation-prone β-strands, such as L145 and M147, hinder domain swapping as a pathway toward dimerization. These findings thus provide critical molecular insights onto the initial stages of age-onset cataract, which is important for understanding protein aggregation diseases.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4569061fce10b48e62e3a807df5d792fa5798672,"The present results suggest that γD-crystallin may polymerize through successive domain swapping of those three C-terminal β-strands leading to age-onset cataract, as an evolutionary cost of its very high stability.",P.

A partially unfolded folding intermediate of gammaD-crystallin is detected in simulations with its C-terminal domain (C-td) folded and N-terminal domain (N-td) unstructured, in excellent agreement with biochemical experiments. Our simulations strongly indicate that the stability and the folding mechanism of the N-td are regulated by the interdomain interactions, consistent with experimental observations.

Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to show that a signal at the single-electron level can be converted and multiplied into 2 or more signals by water chains confined in a narrow Y-shaped nanochannel. This remarkable transduction capability of molecular signal by Y-shaped nanochannel is found to be attributable to the surprisingly strong dipole-induced ordering of such water chains, such that the concerted water orientations in the 2 branches of the Y-shaped nanotubes can be modulated by the water orientation in the main channel. The response to the switching of the charge signal is very rapid, from a few nanoseconds to a few hundred nanoseconds.

Various LIE–SGB fitting schemes are presented and discussed on this relatively large binding set, consisting of a total of more than 50 ligands. For a training subset of 40 ligands (20 nevirapine and 20 HEPT analogues), the LIE–SGB method gives an RMS error (RMSE) of 0.89 kcal/mol with a correlation coefficient of 0.74. The leave-one-out cross validation results also show an encouraging RMSE of 1.00 kcal/mol, with a correlation coefficient of 0.69. The further blind tests on seven mostly high-potent candidates (not originally in the training subset) also show reasonable accuracies. The binding mechanism of this HIV-1RT binding set is found to be mainly driven by van der Waals interactions (i.e. a good geometrical fit is important) and the net loss of ligand cavity energies (i.e. the burial of solvent accessible surface area is favourable). The net electrostatic interactions, however, are found to be anti-binding. A secondary amide indicator is found to be necessary for nevirapine analogues to account for the deficiencies in quantum partial charges, and it is also shown that it represents a critical -type hydrogen bond between the secondary amide fragment of nevirapine analogues and the phenyl ring of Tyr188A residue, which explains their otherwise surprising binding affinities. More quantum charge fittings, with the protein environment included, gave similar results, indicating that an out-of-plane polarisability might be needed to fully capture this -type hydrogen bond in classical force fields. Finally, six new ligands are designed for optimal binding based on our predictions for further experimental validations.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b4cf367b6f03bd7a185f579ee3ba9ff6d6ba5f7d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most critically, the major surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) must adapt to the usage of human-like (alpha-2,6-linked) sialylated glycan receptors. Therefore, identification of mutations that can switch the currently circulating H5N1 HA receptor binding specificity from avian to human might provide leads to the emergence of pandemic H5N1 viruses. To define such mutations in the H5 subtype, here we provide a computational framework that combines molecular modeling with extensive free energy simulations. Our results show that the simulated binding affinities are in good agreement with currently available experimental data. Moreover, we predict that one double mutation (V135S and A138S) in HA significantly enhances alpha-2,6-linked receptor recognition by the H5 subtype. Our simulations indicate that this double mutation in H5N1 HA increases the binding affinity to alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors by 2.6 +/- 0.7 kcal/mol per HA monomer that primarily arises from the electrostatic interactions. Further analyses reveal that introduction of this double mutation results in a conformational change in the receptor binding pocket of H5N1 HA. As a result, a major rearrangement occurs in the hydrogen-bonding network of HA with the human receptor, making the human receptor binding pattern of double mutant H5N1 HA surprisingly similar to that observed in human H1N1 HA.

However, the mechanism behind its denaturing power is still not well understood. Here we show by molecular dynamics simulations that a 7 M aqueous urea solution unfolds a chain of purely hydrophobic groups which otherwise adopts a compact structure in pure water. The unfolding process arises due to a weakening of hydrophobic interactions between the polymer groups. We also show that the attraction between two model hydrophobic plates, and graphene sheets, is reduced when urea is added to the solution. The action of urea is found to be direct, through its preferential binding to the polymer or plates. It is, therefore, acting like a surfactant capable of forming hydrogen bonds with the solvent. The preferential binding and the consequent weakened hydrophobic interactions are driven by enthalpy and are related to the difference in the strength of the attractive dispersion interactions of urea and water with the polymer chain or plate. This relation scales with square root(epsilon(b)), where epsilon(b) is the Lennard Jones (LJ) energy parameter for each group on the chain. Larger values of epsilon(b) increase the preferential binding and result in a larger decrease of the hydrophobic interactions, with a crossover at very weak dispersions. We also show that the indirect mechanism, in which urea acts as a chaotrope, is not a likely cause of urea's action as a denaturant. These findings suggest that, in denaturing proteins, urea (and perhaps other denaturants) forms stronger attractive dispersion interactions with the protein side chains and backbone than does water and, therefore, is able to dissolve the core hydrophobic region.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/39f974c977295ccb0d3968fc0e0a666a8ec37964,"It is shown by molecular dynamics simulations that a 7 M aqueous urea solution unfolds a chain of purely hydrophobic groups which otherwise adopts a compact structure in pure water, and that urea forms stronger attractive dispersion interactions with the protein side chains and backbone than does water and, therefore, is able to dissolve the core Hydrophobic region.",R.

An all-atom protein model with explicit solvents is used to perform an aggregate of several microsecond FEP molecular dynamics simulations. A recent experiment shows that a single mutation in H3N2 HA, T131I, increases the antibody-antigen dissociation constant Kd by a factor of approximately 4000 (equivalent to a binding affinity decrease of approximately 5 kcal/mol), thus introducing an escape of the antibody (Ab) neutralization. Our FEP result confirms this experimental finding by estimating the HA-Ab binding affinity decrease of 5.2 +/- 0.9 kcal/mol but with a somewhat different molecular mechanism from the experimental findings. Detailed analysis reveals that this large binding affinity decrease in the T131I mutant is mainly due to the displacement of two bridge water molecules otherwise present in the wild-type HA/Ab interface. The decomposition of the binding free energy supports this observation, as the major contribution to the binding affinity is from the electrostatic interactions. In addition, we find that the loss of the binding affinity is also related to the large conformational distortion of one loop (loop 155-161) in the unbound state of the mutant. We then simulate all other possible mutations for this specific mutation site T131, and predict a few more mutations with even larger decreases in the binding affinity (i.e., better candidates for antibody neutralization), such as T131W, T131Y, and T131F. As for further validation, we have also modeled another mutation, S157L, with experimental binding affinity available (Kd increasing approximately 500 times), and found a binding affinity decrease of 4.1 +/- 1.0 kcal/mol, which is again in excellent agreement with experiment.

These extensive MD (Molecular Dynamics) simulations (10+ micros) were performed in 8 M urea, mimicking the experimental condition. Detailed analyses revealed that the Trp(62) residue is the key to a co-operative long-range interaction within the wild-type protein: it acts as a bridge between neighbouring basic residues, mainly arginine residues, through pi-type hydrogen bonds or pi-cation interactions to form an Arg-Trp-Arg 'sandwich-like' local structure. The local cluster near Trp(62) further extends its interaction to other clusters, such as the one near Trp(111), through Arg(112), which is involved in such an Arg-Trp-Arg bridging structure, thus achieving the long-range interactions for the wild-type. On the other hand, the mutant does not have this bridging effect and forms much less local clusters or contacts, and therefore results in a much less stable structure.

Our large scale MD simulations found several more proteins, including three tetramers, six dimers, and two two-domain proteins, which display a nanoscale dewetting transition in their final stage of folding. Even though the scoring function alone is not sufficient (i.e., a high score is necessary but not sufficient) in identifying the dewetting candidates, it does provide useful insights into the features of complex interfaces needed for dewetting.

By scaling the Hamiltonian for a selected ""solute"" region of the system, REST effectively applies tempering only to the degrees of freedom of interest but not the rest of the system (""solvent""), allowing fewer replicas for covering the same temperature range. A key consideration of REST is how the solute-solvent interactions are scaled together with the solute-solute interactions. Here, we critically evaluate the performance of the latest REST2 protocol for sampling large-scale conformation fluctuations of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). The results show that REST2 promotes artificial protein conformational collapse at high effective temperatures, which seems to be a designed feature originally to promote the sampling of reversible folding of small proteins. The collapse is particularly severe with larger IDPs, leading to replica segregation in the effective temperature space and hindering effective sampling of large-scale conformational changes. We propose that the scaling of the solute-solvent interactions can be treated as free parameters in REST, which can be tuned to control the solute conformational properties (e.g., chain expansion) at different effective temperatures and achieve more effective sampling. To this end, we derive a new REST3 protocol, where the strengths of the solute-solvent van der Waals interactions are recalibrated to reproduce the levels of protein chain expansion at high effective temperatures. The efficiency of REST3 is examined using two IDPs with nontrivial local and long-range structural features, including the p53 N-terminal domain and the kinase inducible transactivation domain of transcription factor CREB. The results suggest that REST3 leads to a much more efficient temperature random walk and improved sampling efficiency, which also further reduces the number of replicas required. Nonetheless, our analysis also reveals significant challenges of relying on tempering alone for sampling large-scale conformational fluctuations of disordered proteins. It is likely that more efficient sampling protocols will require incorporating more sophisticated Hamiltonian replica exchange schemes in addition to tempering.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/81ee64219c8a5d4b2aa5ae625ca844fcd1c3582d,It is found that exchanges between folded (F) and unfolded (U) conformations with vastly different structural energies are greatly reduced by the nonappearance of the water self-interaction energy in the replica exchange acceptance probabilities.,Y.

Compared to explicit solvent models, implicit solvent models, such as the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) with solvent accessible surface area model (PB/SA), offer a much faster speed—the most compelling reason for the popularity of these implicit solvent models. Since these implicit solvent models typically use empirical parameters, such as atomic radii and the surface tensions, an optimal fit of these parameters is crucial for the final accuracy of properties such as solvation free energy and folding free energy. In this paper, we proposed a combined approach, namely SD/GA, which takes the advantage of both local optimization with the steepest descent (SD), and global optimization with the genetic algorithm (GA), for parameters optimization in multi-dimensional space. The SD/GA method is then applied to the optimization of solvation parameters in the non-polar cavity term of the PB/SA model. The results show that the newly optimized parameters from SD/GA not only increase the accuracy in the solvation free energies for ∼200 organic molecules, but also significantly improve the free energy landscape of a β-hairpin folding.

The unusual superhydrophobicity of fluorocarbons is found to be related to their larger size (or surface area) as compared to hydrocarbons, which ""dilutes"" their physical interactions with water. The water-plate interaction profile shows that the fluorinated carbons have a 10-12% weaker water-plate interaction than their hydrogenated counterparts in the nearest solvation shell, even though the fluorocarbons do have a stronger electrostatic interaction with water due to their larger partial charges. However, the van der Waals interactions dominate the water-plate interaction within the nearest shell, with up to 90% contributions to the total interaction energy, and fluorocarbons have a noticeably weaker (by 10-15%) van der Waals interaction with water in the nearest shell than do hydrocarbons. Both the slightly weaker water-plate interaction and larger surface area contribute to the stronger dewetting transition in the current fluorinated carbon plates.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c822fcd0258e592a3c62f85f3c5f6f645dcbbcce,"The water dynamics near nanoscale fluorinated monolayers (plates) as well as possible dewetting transitions in-between two such plates have been studied with molecular dynamics simulations, and a ""weak water depletion"" is found near the single fluorinated surface.",X.

These studies have raised the question whether the underlining Poisson-Boltzmann theory, on which the generalized Born model is calibrated, is adequate in the treatment of polar interactions for the challenging protein folding simulations. To address the question whether the Poisson-Boltzmann theory in the current formalism might be insufficient, we directly tested our efficient numerical Poisson-Boltzmann implementation in the beta-hairpin folding simulation. Good agreement between simulation and experiment was found for the beta-hairpin equilibrium structures when the numerical Poisson-Boltzmann solvent and a recently improved generalized Born solvent were used.

Hydrophobicity induces a drying transition in the gap between simple sufficiently large (more than 1 nm(2)) strongly hydrophobic surfaces as they approach each other, resulting in the subsequent collapse of the system, as well as a depletion of water next to single surfaces. Here we investigate whether the hydrophobic induced collapse of multidomain proteins or the formation of protein oligimers exhibits a similar drying transition. We performed computer simulations to study the collapse of the tetramer of melittin in water, and observed a marked water drying transition inside a nanoscale channel of the tetramer (with a channel size of up to two or three water-molecule diameters). This transition, although occurring on a microscopic length scale, is analogous to a first-order phase transition from liquid to vapour. We find that this drying is very sensitive to single mutations of the three isoleucines to less hydrophobic residues and that such mutations in the right locations can switch the channel from being dry to being wet. Thus, quite subtle changes in hydrophobic surface topology can profoundly influence the drying transition. We show that, even in the presence of the polar protein backbone, sufficiently hydrophobic protein surfaces can induce a liquid-vapour transition providing an enormous driving force towards further collapse. This behaviour was unexpected because of the absence of drying in the collapse of the multidomain protein 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase (BphC).",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ead380417d553566c0a213da0c7b659005d97ab2,"It is shown that, even in the presence of the polar protein backbone, sufficiently hydrophobic protein surfaces can induce a liquid–vapour transition providing an enormous driving force towards further collapse.",P.

The idea is to run several replicas of the system in parallel at different temperatures that are swapped periodically. These swaps are typically attempted every few MD steps and accepted or rejected according to a Metropolis-Hastings criterion. This guarantees that the joint distribution of the composite system of replicas is the normalized sum of the symmetrized product of the canonical distributions of these replicas at the different temperatures. Here we propose a different implementation of REMD in which (i) the swaps obey a continuous-time Markov jump process implemented via Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA), which also samples exactly the aforementioned joint distribution and has the advantage of being rejection free, and (ii) this REMD-SSA is combined with the heterogeneous multiscale method to accelerate the rate of the swaps and reach the so-called infinite-swap limit that is known to optimize sampling efficiency. The method is easy to implement and can be trivially parallelized. Here we illustrate its accuracy and efficiency on the examples of alanine dipeptide in vacuum and C-terminal β-hairpin of protein G in explicit solvent.

Currently, the protein folding mechanism is often characterized by calculating the free energy landscape versus various reaction coordinates, such as the fraction of native contacts, the radius of gyration, RMSD from the native structure, and so on. In this paper, we present a combinatorial pattern discovery approach toward understanding the global state changes during the folding process. This is a first step toward an unsupervised (and perhaps eventually automated) approach toward identification of global states. The approach is based on computing biclusters (or patterned clusters)-each cluster is a combination of various reaction coordinates, and its signature pattern facilitates the computation of the Z-score for the cluster. For this discovery process, we present an algorithm of time complexity c in RO((N + nm) log n), where N is the size of the output patterns and (n x m) is the size of the input with n time frames and m reaction coordinates. To date, this is the best time complexity for this problem. We next apply this to a beta-hairpin folding trajectory and demonstrate that this approach extracts crucial information about protein folding intermediate states and mechanism. We make three observations about the approach: (1) The method recovers states previously obtained by visually analyzing free energy surfaces. (2) It also succeeds in extracting meaningful patterns and structures that had been overlooked in previous works, which provides a better understanding of the folding mechanism of the beta-hairpin. These new patterns also interconnect various states in existing free energy surfaces versus different reaction coordinates. (3) The approach does not require calculating the free energy values, yet it offers an analysis comparable to, and sometimes better than, the methods that use free energy landscapes, thus validating the choice of reaction coordinates.

A highly parallel replica exchange molecular dynamics method is used for the conformation space sampling, with the help of a recently developed efficient molecular dynamics algorithm P3ME/RESPA (particle-particle particle-mesh Ewald/reference system propagator algorithm). A two-step folding mechanism is proposed that involves an intermediate state where two correctly formed partial hydrophobic cores are separated by an essential salt-bridge between residues Asp-9 and Arg-16 near the center of the peptide. This metastable intermediate state provides an explanation for the superfast folding process.

Since the hydrophobic moment profiling characterizes a global feature and requires reasonably good statistics, this imposes a constraint upon the size of the protein structures in order to yield relatively smooth moment profiles. We show that even subject to the limitations of protein size (both Park & Levitt and Baker sets are small protein decoys), the hydrophobic moment profiling and hydrophobic score can provide useful information that should be complementary to the information provided by force field calculations.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e29cf655a481bd0f9a933816e5aa104d9eeb9a3,"It is shown that even subject to the limitations of protein size (both Park & Levitt and Baker sets are small protein decoys), the hydrophobic moment profiling andhydrophobic score can provide useful information that should be complementary to the information provided by force field calculations.",R.

Using the fast and reliable quantum mechanical methods supplies robust fitting data for the resulting parameter sets. As a result, gas-phase many-body effects for dipeptides are captured within the average RMSD of 0.22 kcal/mol from their ab initio values, and conformational energies for the di- and tetrapeptides are reproduced within the average RMSD of 0.43 kcal/mol from their quantum mechanical counterparts.

The OPLSAA force field is used for the beta-hairpin in both implicit and explicit solvent simulations, and the conformational space sampling is carried out with a highly parallel replica-exchange method. Surprisingly, we find from exhaustive conformation space sampling that the free energy landscape from the implicit solvent model is quite different from that of the explicit solvent model. In the implicit solvent model some nonnative states are heavily overweighted, and more importantly, the lowest free energy state is no longer the native beta-strand structure. An overly strong salt-bridge effect between charged residues (E42, D46, D47, E56, and K50) is found to be responsible for this behavior in the implicit solvent model. Despite this, we find that the OPLSAA/SGB energies of all the nonnative structures are higher than that of the native structure; thus the OPLSAA/SGB energy is still a good scoring function for structure prediction for this beta-hairpin. Furthermore, the beta-hairpin population at 282 K is found to be less than 40% from the implicit solvent model, which is much smaller than the 72% from the explicit solvent model and approximately equal 80% from experiment.

The ability to predict computationally the thermodynamics of these molecular recognition processes has been relatively weak until recently, however, continued developments on several fronts are extending the scope of applicability of these methods. The rapid growth in the number of protein-ligand structures has initially led to the development of a range of empirical scoring functions based on relatively simple descriptions of intermolecular interactions. These methods have had some success in ranking binding affinities when tuned to particular protein systems or in rather qualitative estimates of molecular fit in fast docking calculations. However, they are too unreliable for more detailed, quantitative, assessment and comparison of binding affinities. Physics-based free energy calculations are in principle more general and have the potential to be significantly more accurate. These approaches have seen steady development over many years and rely on carefully calibrated molecular energy functions (force-fields), simulations of the systems with explicit solvent, and the coming-of-age of continuum solvation models. In addition to the initially developped Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) and Thermodynamic Integration (TI) methods, new approaches include the Molecular Mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) and the Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) approaches.

To improve efficiency in the parallel computation, we have to reduce the amount of data transfer between processors by introducing domain decomposition schemes. Also, it is important to optimize the computational balance between real-space non-bonded interactions and reciprocal-space interactions for long-range electrostatic interactions. Here, we introduce a novel parallelization scheme for large-scale MD simulations on massively parallel supercomputers consisting of only CPUs. We make use of a multiple program/multiple data (MPMD) approach for separating the real-space and reciprocal-space computations on different processors. We also utilize the r-RESPA multiple time step integrator on the framework of the MPMD approach in an efficient way: when the reciprocal-space computations are skipped in r-RESPA, processors assigned for them are utilized for half of the real-space computations. The new scheme allows us to use twice as many as processors that are available in the conventional single program approach. The best performances of all-atom MD simulations for 1 million (STMV), 8.5 million (8_STMV), and 28.8 million (27_STMV) atom systems on K computer are 65, 36, and 24 ns/day, respectively. The MPMD scheme can accelerate 23.4, 10.2, and 9.2 ns/day from the maximum performance of single-program approach for STMV, 8_STMV, and 27_STMV systems, respectively, which correspond to 57%, 39%, and 60% speed up. This suggests significant speedups by increasing the number of processors without losing parallel computational efficiency. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/60cef6b365eb9ffdfa4e0006416b1bee3496d776,,J.

This work presents a new continuum electrostatics model based on Kirkwood's analytic result for the electrostatic component of the solvation free energy for a solute with arbitrary charge distribution. Unlike GB, which is limited to monopoles, our generalized Kirkwood (GK) model can treat solute electrostatics represented by any combination of permanent and induced atomic multipole moments of arbitrary degree. Here we apply the GK model to the newly developed Atomic Multipole Optimized Energetics for Biomolecular Applications (AMOEBA) force field, which includes permanent atomic multipoles through the quadrupole and treats polarization via induced dipoles. A derivation of the GK gradient is presented, which enables energy minimization or molecular dynamics of an AMOEBA solute within a GK continuum. For a series of 55 proteins, GK electrostatic solvation free energies are compared to the Polarizable Multipole Poisson-Boltzmann (PMPB) model and yield a mean unsigned relative difference of 0.9%. Additionally, the reaction field of GK compares well to that of the PMPB model, as shown by a mean unsigned relative difference of 2.7% in predicting the total solvated dipole moment for each protein in this test set.

However, it is important to elucidate how synthetic nanomaterials interact with critical biological systems before such products can be safely utilized in humans. Past evidence suggests that polyethylene glycol-functionalized (PEGylated) nanomaterials are largely biocompatible and elicit less dramatic immune responses than their pristine counterparts. We here report results that contradict these findings. We find that PEGylated graphene oxide nanosheets (nGO-PEGs) stimulate potent cytokine responses in peritoneal macrophages, despite not being internalized. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations support a mechanism by which nGO-PEGs preferentially adsorb onto and/or partially insert into cell membranes, thereby amplifying interactions with stimulatory surface receptors. Further experiments demonstrate that nGO-PEG indeed provokes cytokine secretion by enhancing integrin β8-related signalling pathways.

From time to time the configurations of neighboring replicas are exchanged and this exchange is accepted or rejected based on a Metropolis acceptance criterion that guarantees the detailed balance. Two example protein systems, one alpha-helix and one beta-hairpin, are used as case studies to demonstrate the power of the algorithm. Up to 64 replicas of solvated protein systems are simulated in parallel over a wide range of temperatures. The simulation results show that the combined trajectories in temperature and configurational space allow a replica to overcome free energy barriers present at low temperatures. These large-scale simulations also reveal detailed results on folding mechanisms, intermediate state structures, thermodynamic properties, and the temperature dependences for both protein systems.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bf6a6401921fae6946792647fa1233e376040aa3,"In this chapter, a highly parallel replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) method and its application to protein folding are described and the combined trajectories in temperature and configurational space allow a replica to overcome free energy barriers present at low temperatures.",R.

For example, MoS2 has gained attention in the biomedical field because of its ability to act as an antibacterial and anticancer agent. However, the potential influence of this exciting nanomaterial on biomolecules is yet to be extensively studied. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are invaluable tools in the examination of protein interactions with nanomaterials such as MoS2. Previous protein MD studies have employed MoS2 force field parameters which were developed to accurately model bulk crystal structures and thermal heat transport but may not necessarily be amendable to its properties at the interface with biomolecules. By adopting a newly developed MoS2 force field, which was designed to better capture its interaction with water and proteins, we have examined the changes in protein structures between the original and refitted MoS2 force field parameters of three representative proteins, polyalanine (α-helix), YAP65 WW-domains (β-sheet), and HP35 (globular protein) when adsorbed onto MoS2 nanomaterials. We find that the original force field, with much larger van der Waals (vdW) contributions, resulted in more dramatic protein structural damage than the refitted parameters. Importantly, some denaturation of the protein tertiary structure and the local secondary structure persisted with the refitted force field albeit overall less severe MoS2 denaturation capacity was found. This work suggests that the denaturation ability of MoS2 to the protein structure is not as dire as previously reported and provides noteworthy findings on the dynamic interactions of proteins with this emergent material.",,,Z.

We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the wild-type and mutant p19 protein (W39 and W42G) binding with a 21-nt siRNA duplex to study the p19-siRNA recognition mechanism and mutation effects. Our simulations with standard MD and steered molecular dynamics have shown that the double mutant structure is indeed much less stable than the wild-type, consistent with the recent experimental findings. Comprehensive structural analysis also shows that the W39/42G mutations first induce the loss of stacking interactions between p19 and siRNA, Trp(42)-Cyt1 (Cyt1 from the 5' to 3' strand) and Trp(39)-Gua'19 (Gua19 from the 3' to 5' strand), and then breaks the hydrophobic core formed by W39-W42 with nucleotide basepairs in the wild-type. The steered molecular dynamics simulations also show that the mutant p19 complex is ""decompounded"" very fast under a constant separation force, whereas the wild-type remains largely intact under the same steering force. Moreover, we have used the free energy perturbation to predict a binding affinity loss of 6.98 +/- 0.95 kcal/mol for the single mutation W39G, and 12.8 +/- 1.0 kcal/mol loss for the double mutation W39/42G, with the van der Waals interactions dominating the contribution ( approximately 90%). These results indicate that the W39/42G mutations essentially destroy the important p19-siRNA recognition by breaking the strong stacking interaction between Cyt1 and Gua'19 with end-capping tryptophans.

Unfortunately, surface passivation of graphene might stimulate undesired immune response as the nanomaterial triggers cytokine production through membrane receptor activation. Herein, we use all-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to unravel the underlying mechanism of graphene-induced inside-out activation of integrin αvβ8, a prominent membrane receptor expressed in immune cells. We model the transmembrane (TM) domains of integrin αvβ8 in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) lipid bilayer and observe the structural changes in the integrin-membrane complex when interacting with a graphene nanosheet across the membrane. We find that the β8 TM domain interacts with the graphene nanosheet directly or indirectly through extracted lipids, facilitating the pulling of a β8 subunit away from an αv subunit and thus leading to the disruption of the TM domain association by breaking the hydrophobic cluster in the cytoplasmic domains of the αv and β8 subunits. Alanine substitution of two conserved phenylalanine residues on the αv subunit at this hydrophobic cluster further reveals the importance of a stable T-shaped structure in retaining integrin in its inactive state. Our results agree with previous studies on the interactions between other integrin subtypes and their endogenous activators, suggesting an intriguing role that the graphene nanosheet may play in the integrin-related signal transduction during its interaction with the membrane.",,,SH.

For biomedical applications, QDs are typically coated with a biocompatible molecule for the system of interest. Experiments have indicated a QD dose-dependent and surface coating-dependent toxicity, with a portion of the toxicity being ascribed to interference with biomolecules. In this work, the interaction of trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) coated (CdSe)13 QDs with the SRC homology 3 domain (SH3) protein domain are explored using molecular dynamics simulations. The results of this research agree well with experiments that show that at the lowest concentration, the QDs have little affinity for the native proline-rich motif (PRM) binding site of SH3. At higher concentrations, the QDs aggregate and increasingly prefer the PRM binding site, indicating that the normal SH3 function is impeded. This binding dependence is attributed to changes in the local density of the surface coated TOPO molecules upon aggregation. These results present possible interesting QD toxicity patterns and reveal the interdependence between dose and surface coating effects in QD toxicity.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1aadd3678ffcb3a6f716ff5faa872d5e0c7bd100,The interaction of trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) coated (CdSe)13 QDs with the SRC homology 3 domain (SH3) protein domain are explored using molecular dynamics simulations and the interdependence between dose and surface coating effects in QD toxicity is revealed.,DR.

Due to the high reactivity of dangling bonds, this process is confined to ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, which currently limits its commercialization and broad-based appeal. In this work, we explore the use of halogen adatoms to preserve APAM-derived lithographic patterns outside of UHV to enable facile transfer into real-world commercial processes. Specifically, we examine the stability of H-, Cl-, Br-, and I-passivated Si(100) in inert N2and ambient environments. Characterization with scanning tunneling microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that each of the fully passivated surfaces were resistant to oxidation in 1 atm of N2for up to 44 h. Varying levels of surface degradation and contamination were observed upon exposure to the laboratory ambient environment. Characterization byex situXPS after ambient exposures ranging from 15 min to 8 h indicated the Br- and I-passivated Si surfaces were highly resistant to degradation, while Cl-passivated Si showed signs of oxidation within minutes of ambient exposure. As a proof-of-principle demonstration of pattern preservation, a H-passivated Si sample patterned and passivated with independent Cl, Br, I, and bare Si regions was shown to maintain its integrity in all but the bare Si region post-exposure to an N2environment. The successful demonstration of the preservation of APAM patterns outside of UHV environments opens new possibilities for transporting atomically-precise devices outside of UHV for integrating with non-UHV processes, such as other chemistries and commercial semiconductor device processes.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/838837fb3c6e9423713158827bbaa965ed066a21,,E.

The conformation space is reduced in dimensionality by introduction of linear combinations of hydrogen bond distances as the collective variables making use of a specially adapted principal component analysis (PCA); i.e., to make structured conformations more pronounced, only the formed bonds are included in determining the principal components. It is shown that a three-dimensional (3D) subspace gives a meaningful representation of the folding behavior. The first component, to which eight native hydrogen bonds make the major contribution (four in each beta hairpin), is found to play the role of the reaction coordinate for the overall folding process, while the second and third components distinguish the structured conformations. The representative points of the trajectory in the 3D space are grouped into conformational clusters that correspond to locally stable conformations of beta3s identified in earlier work. A simplified kinetic network based on the three components is constructed, and it is complemented by a hydrodynamic analysis. The latter, making use of ""passive tracers"" in 3D space, indicates that the folding flow is much more complex than suggested by the kinetic network. A 2D representation of streamlines shows there are vortices which correspond to repeated local rearrangement, not only around minima of the free energy surface but also in flat regions between minima. The vortices revealed by the hydrodynamic analysis are apparently not evident in folding pathways generated by transition-path sampling. Making use of the fact that the values of the collective hydrogen bond variables are linearly related to the Cartesian coordinate space, the RMSD between clusters is determined. Interestingly, the transition rates show an approximate exponential correlation with distance in the hydrogen bond subspace. Comparison with the many published studies shows good agreement with the present analysis for the parts that can be compared, supporting the robust character of our understanding of this ""hydrogen atom"" of protein folding.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8f69a58c7e731e87fde3bdfc7e55c5b687d93afc,A combinatorial algorithmic approach towards understanding the global state changes of the conﬁgurations of protein folding mechanisms and an algorithm of time complexity is presented.,IV.

We apply our affinity calculation technique to HLA-antigen-T-cell receptor (TCR) systems relevant to celiac disease (CeD) by investigating binding affinity differences between HLA-DQ2.5 (enhanced CeD risk) and HLA-DQ7.5 (CeD protective) in the binary (HLA-gliadin) and ternary (HLA-gliadin-TCR) binding complexes for three gliadin derived epitopes: glia-α1, glia-α2, and glia-ω1. Based on FEP calculations with our carefully designed thermodynamic cycles, we demonstrate that HLA-DQ2.5 has higher binding affinity than HLA-DQ7.5 for gliadin and enhanced binding affinity with a common TCR, agreeing with known results that the HLA-DQ2.5 serotype exhibits increased risk for CeD. Our findings reveal that our proposed absolute binding affinity FEP method is appropriate for predicting HLA binding for disparate antigens with different genotypes. We also discuss atomic-level details of HLA genotypes interacting with gluten peptides and TCRs in regard to the pathogenesis of CeD.",,,Y.

Recently, solid-state plasmonic and nanopore structures have been integrated within monolithic devices that address fundamental challenges in each of the individual sensing methods and offer complimentary improvements in overall single-molecule sensitivity, detection rates, dwell time and scalability. Here, the physical phenomena and sensing principles of plasmonic and nanopore sensing are summarized to highlight the novel complementarity in dovetailing these techniques for vastly improved single-molecule sensing. A literature review of recent plasmonic nanopore devices is then presented to delineate methods for solid-state fabrication of a range of hybrid device formats, evaluate the progress and challenges in the detection of unlabeled and labeled analyte, and assess the impact and utility of localized plasmonic heating.

Screening and refinement of protein structures from fold recognition,"R Zhou, BD Silverman, G Dent, A Royyuru, A Curioni, A Logen",2005.0,1,{2008: 1},"RECOMB2005, MIT, 2005","RECOMB2005, MIT",,,,,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Im3XjhJXvQ8J:scholar.google.com/,,,,,,,,"The design of potent protein kinase C (PK-C) ligands with low nanomolar binding affinities was accomplished by the combined use of pharmacophore- and receptor-guided approaches based on the structure of the physiological enzyme activator, diacylglycerol (DAG). Earlier use of the former approach, which was based on the structural equivalence of DAG and phorbol ester pharmacophores, identified a fixed template for the construction of a semirigid ""recognition domain"" that contained the three principal pharmacophores of DAG constrained into a lactone ring (DAG-lactones). In the present work, the pharmacophore-guided approach was refined to a higher level based on the X-ray structure of the C1b domain of PK-Cdelta complexed with phorbol-13-O-acetate. A systematic search that involved modifying the DAG-lactone template with a combination of linear or branched acyl and alpha-alkylidene chains, which functioned as variable hydrophobic ""affinity domains"", helped identify compounds that optimized hydrophobic contacts with a group of conserved hydrophobic amino acids located on the top half of the C1 domain where the phorbol binds. The hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance of the molecules was estimated by the octanol/water partition coefficients (log P) calculated according to a fragment-based approach. The presence of branched alpha-alkylidene or acyl chains was of critical importance to reach low nanomolar binding affinities for PK-C. These branched chains appear to facilitate important van der Waals contacts with hydrophobic segments of the protein and help promote the activation of PK-C through critical membrane interactions. Molecular modeling of these DAG-lactones into an empty C1b domain using the program AutoDock 2.4 suggests the existence of competing binding modes (sn-1 and sn-2) depending on which carbonyl is directly involved in binding to the protein. Inhibition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding, an indirect PK-C mediated response, was realized with some DAG-lactones at a dose 10-fold higher than with the standard phorbol-12, 13-dibutyrate (PDBU). Through the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 60-cell line in vitro screen, DAG-lactone 31 was identified as a very selective and potent antitumor agent. The NCI's computerized, pattern-recognition program COMPARE, which analyzes the degree of similarity of mean-graph profiles produced by the screen, corroborated our principles of drug design by matching the profile of compound 31 with that of the non-tumor-promoting antitumor phorbol ester, prostratin. The structural simplicity and the degree of potency achieved with some of the DAG-lactones described here should dispel the myth that chemical complexity and pharmacological activity go hand in hand. Even as a racemate, DAG-lactone 31 showed low namomolar binding affinity for PK-C and displayed selective antitumor activity at equivalent nanomolar levels. Our present approach should facilitate the generation of multiple libraries of structurally similar DAG-lactones to help exploit molecular diversity for PK-C and other high-affinity receptors for DAG and the phorbol esters. The success of this work suggests that substantially simpler, high-affinity structures could be identified to function as surrogates of other complex natural products.",,,K.

Several studies reported the association of genetic alterations in the SLC14A1 (UT-B1) gene with bladder carcinogenesis, suggesting a need for thorough characterization of the UT-B1 protein's coding and non-coding variants. This study used various computational techniques to investigate the commonly occurring germ-line missense and non-coding SNPs (ncSNPs) of the SLC14A1 gene (UT-B1) for their structural, functional, and molecular implications for disease susceptibility and dysfunctionality. SLC14A1 missense variants, primarily identified from the ENSEMBL genome browser, were screened through twelve functionality prediction tools leading to two variants D280Y (predicted detrimental by maximum tools) and D280N (high global MAF) for rs1058396. Subsequently, the ConSurf and NetSurf tools revealed the D280 residue to be in a variable site and exposed on the protein surface. According to I-Mutant2.0 and MUpro, both variants are predicted to cause a significant effect on protein stability. Analysis of molecular docking anticipated these two variants to decrease the binding affinity of UT-B1 protein for the examined ligands to a significant extent. Molecular dynamics also disclosed the possible destabilization of the UT-B1 protein due to single nucleotide polymorphism compared to wild-type protein which may result in impaired protein function. Furthermore, several non-coding SNPs were estimated to affect transcription factor binding and regulation of SLC14A1 gene expression. Additionally, two ncSNPs were found to affect miRNA-based post-transcriptional regulation by creating new seed regions for miRNA binding.

These pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs, respectively), resulting in the induction of inflammatory cell death, are detected by specific innate immune sensors. Recently, Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), also called the DNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factor (DAI) or DLM1, is reported to regulate inflammatory cell death as a central mediator during viral infection. ZBP1 is an interferon (IFN)-inducible gene that contains two Z-form nucleic acid-binding domains (Zα1 and Zα2) in the N-terminus and two receptor-interacting protein homotypic interaction motifs (RHIM1 and RHIM2) in the middle, which interact with other proteins with the RHIM domain. By sensing the entry of viral RNA, ZBP1 induces PANoptosis, which protects host cells against viral infections, such as influenza A virus (IAV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV1). However, some viruses, particularly coronaviruses (CoVs), induce PANoptosis to hyperactivate the immune system, leading to cytokine storm, organ failure, tissue damage, and even death. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanism of ZBP1-derived PANoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines that influence the double-edged sword of results in the host cell.

The allosteric binding makes Gd@C82(OH)22 a promising inhibitor selective for MMP-9. However, the hydrophobic nature of the aromatic carbon cage may cause Gd@C82(OH)22 to self-aggregate in aqueous solutions, hence weakening the binding. In this study, we designed Gd@C82(OH)22 derivatives aiming at improving the binding affinity for MMP-9. Upon a mutation that substitutes a new functional group (-PO42-, -CH2CO2-, -CO2-, -NH3+, or -CONH2) for a hydroxyl group on the fullerenol surface, we calculated the changes in the binding free energy to the catalytic domain of human MMP-9 using the free energy perturbation (FEP) method. We found that the higher the net charge of the functional group, the stronger the binding. Compared with Gd@C82(OH)22, Gd@C82(OH)21(PO4)2- binds at least 1.5 to 2.5 kcal mol-1 more strongly to MMP-9. The binding is specifically controlled by electrostatic interactions between the phosphate group and the charged residues at the binding site. In addition to the net charge, the binding free energy can be delicately adjusted by other factors, such as the functionalization site on Gd@C82(OH)22, the local environment of the putative binding site of MMP-9, and the presence of ions near the charged functional group.

In terms of the mechanical properties, a comparative study of MoS2/SiO2 and graphene/SiO2 systems is presented. The MoS2/SiO2 and graphene/SiO2 systems are found to possess comparable Young's modulus and hardness values, but their mechanical responses and failure modes under indentation are totally different. Interface delamination failure accompanied by ring-like through-thickness cracking is observed in the MoS2/SiO2 system with a relatively thin MoS2 layer, while no interface separation is found in indentation experiments for the graphene/SiO2 system using the same layer thickness. The different failure modes observed between the MoS2/SiO2 and graphene/SiO2 systems can be attributed to the comparable interface adhesion energy but very different bending stiffness values of the MoS2 and graphene components.

The goal of ligand-protein docking is to predict the predominant binding mode(s) of a ligand with a protein of known three-dimensional structure. Successful docking methods search high-dimensional spaces effectively and use a scoring function that correctly ranks candidate dockings. Docking can be used to perform virtual screening on large libraries of compounds, rank the results, and propose structural hypotheses of how the ligands inhibit the target, which is invaluable in lead optimization. The setting up of the input structures for the docking is just as important as the docking itself, and analyzing the results of stochastic search methods can sometimes be unclear. This chapter discusses the background and theory of molecular docking software, and covers the usage of some of the most-cited docking software.",,,GM.

The molecular mechanisms of substrate recruitment by T2SS remain elusive but a prevailing view is that the secretion determinants could be of a structural nature. The phytopathogenic γ-proteobacteria, Pectobacterium carotovorum and Dickeya dadantii, secrete similar sets of homologous plant cell wall degrading enzymes, mainly pectinases, by similar T2SSs, called Out. However, the orthologous pectate lyases Pel3 and PelI from these bacteria, which share 67% of sequence identity, are not secreted by the counterpart T2SS of each bacterium, indicating a fine-tuned control of protein recruitment. To identify the related secretion determinants, we first performed a structural characterization and comparison of Pel3 with PelI using X-ray crystallography. Then, to assess the biological relevance of the observed structural variations, we conducted a loop-substitution analysis of Pel3 combined with secretion assays. We showed that there is not one element with a definite secondary structure but several distant and structurally flexible loop regions that are essential for the secretion of Pel3 and that these loop regions act together as a composite secretion signal. Interestingly, depending on the crystal contacts, one of these key secretion determinants undergoes disorder-to-order transitions that could reflect its transient structuration upon the contact with the appropriate T2SS components. We hypothesize that such T2SS-induced structuration of some intrinsically disordered zones of secretion substrates could be part of the recruitment mechanism used by T2SS.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4ef04cc215774e1fc3e77c08cdc5a6b848d3b09c,"Three major experimental methods for analyzing biological molecular structures, namely, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and electron microscopy are introduced in this article.",C.

This is both an opportunity and a significant biocomputing challenge. We present here a 3D visualization methodology and freely-available software package for facilitating the exploration and analysis of high-dimensional human microbiome data. Our visualization approach harnesses the power of commercial video game development engines to provide an interactive medium in the form of a 3D heat map for exploration of microbial species and their relative abundance in different patients. The advantage of this approach is that the third dimension provides additional layers of information that cannot be visualized using a traditional 2D heat map. We demonstrate the usefulness of this visualization approach using microbiome data collected from a sample of premature babies with and without sepsis.,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9c786dff0f9d4018cc13db482e98994c8786e03a,"The sixth Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing marks the first PSB held after the completion of the ""rough draft"" of the Human Genome Sequence, and offers a cutting-edge view of all these activities in a set of sessions that have arisen from grass-roots proposals about how to focus the meeting.",JH.

In response, many methods have been developed to reduce the computational cost by coarsening the granularity of the problem. Inevitably accuracy remains limited for these methods and so in recent years a consensus has emerged that we should work at more than one level of resolution, often simultaneously, in an approach known as multi-resolution modeling. We propose to organize a session on multi-resolution approaches to predict and analyze macromolecular structure, assembly and dynamics. This session will focus on state-of-the-art methodological developments and applications at different levels of molecular organization. Research directions are based on developments arising in the community field of the organizers, like the ones developed in the NIH Center for Biomedical Computation at Stanford University. In this proposal, the emphasis is made on integrative techniques for analysis of molecular structure and organization. Bridging the gap between computer science and structural biology, we represent an emerging community, presenting new efficient representations for the prediction and analysis of molecular structures and dynamics.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/74515afc80f31730ea9f79059cff662df09674a8,"Bridging the gap between computer science and structural biology, an emerging community is represented, presenting new efficient representations for the prediction and analysis of molecular structures and dynamics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for both the wild-type and the mutant hen lysozyme (TRP62GLY) to study the single mutation effect on lysozyme stability and misfolding. Our thermal denaturing simulations at 400-500 K with both the OPLSAA and the CHARMM force fields show that the mutant structure is indeed much less stable than the wild-type, which is consistent with the recent urea denaturing experiment (Dobson et al. Science 2002, 295, 1719-1722; Nature 2003, 424, 783-788). Detailed results also reveal that the single mutation TRP62GLY first induces the loss of native contacts in the beta-domain region of the lysozyme protein at high temperatures, and then the unfolding process spreads into the alpha-domain region through Helix C. Even though the OPLSAA force field in general shows a more stable protein structure than does the CHARMM force field at high temperatures, the two force fields examined here display qualitatively similar results for the misfolding process, indicating that the thermal denaturing of the single mutation is robust and reproducible with various modern force fields.",,,M.

Unfortunately, WE simulations of sufficiently complex systems will not relax to steady state on observed simulation times. Here, we show that a postsimulation clustering of molecular configurations into ""microbins"" using methods developed in the Markov State Model (MSM) community can yield unbiased kinetics from WE data before steady-state convergence of the WE simulation itself. Because WE trajectories are directional and not equilibrium distributed, the history-augmented MSM (haMSM) formulation can be used, which yields the mean first-passage time (MFPT) without bias for arbitrarily small lag times. Accurate kinetics can be obtained while bypassing the often prohibitive convergence requirements of the nonequilibrium weighted ensemble. We validate the method in a simple diffusive process on a two-dimensional (2D) random energy landscape and then analyze atomistic protein folding simulations using WE molecular dynamics.

The idea is to run several replicas of the system in parallel at different temperatures that are swapped periodically. These swaps are typically attempted every few MD steps and accepted or rejected according to a Metropolis-Hastings criterion. This guarantees that the joint distribution of the composite system of replicas is the normalized sum of the symmetrized product of the canonical distributions of these replicas at the different temperatures. Here we propose a different implementation of REMD in which (i) the swaps obey a continuous-time Markov jump process implemented via Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA), which also samples exactly the aforementioned joint distribution and has the advantage of being rejection free, and (ii) this REMD-SSA is combined with the heterogeneous multiscale method to accelerate the rate of the swaps and reach the so-called infinite-swap limit that is known to optimize sampling efficiency. The method is easy to implement and can be trivially parallelized. Here we illustrate its accuracy and efficiency on the examples of alanine dipeptide in vacuum and C-terminal β-hairpin of protein G in explicit solvent. In this latter example, our results indicate that the landscape of the protein is a triple funnel with two folded structures and one misfolded structure that are stabilized by H-bonds.",,,TQ.

To enable this, we introduce a diffusion process that respects the conformational statistics of polymer ensembles, an efficient neural architecture for molecular systems that enables long-range reasoning with sub-quadratic scaling, layers for efficiently synthesizing three-dimensional structures of proteins from predicted inter-residue geometries and a general low-temperature sampling algorithm for diffusion models. Chroma achieves protein design as Bayesian inference under external constraints, which can involve symmetries, substructure, shape, semantics and even natural-language prompts. The experimental characterization of 310 proteins shows that sampling from Chroma results in proteins that are highly expressed, fold and have favourable biophysical properties. The crystal structures of two designed proteins exhibit atomistic agreement with Chroma samples (a backbone root-mean-square deviation of around 1.0 Å). With this unified approach to protein design, we hope to accelerate the programming of protein matter to benefit human health, materials science and synthetic biology.",,,JB.

Due to the high reactivity of dangling bonds, this process is confined to ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, which currently limits its commercialization and broad-based appeal. In this work, we explore the use of halogen adatoms to preserve APAM-derived lithographic patterns outside of UHV to enable facile transfer into real-world commercial processes. Specifically, we examine the stability of H-, Cl-, Br-, and I-passivated Si(100) in inert N2and ambient environments. Characterization with scanning tunneling microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that each of the fully passivated surfaces were resistant to oxidation in 1 atm of N2for up to 44 h. Varying levels of surface degradation and contamination were observed upon exposure to the laboratory ambient environment. Characterization byex situXPS after ambient exposures ranging from 15 min to 8 h indicated the Br- and I-passivated Si surfaces were highly resistant to degradation, while Cl-passivated Si showed signs of oxidation within minutes of ambient exposure. As a proof-of-principle demonstration of pattern preservation, a H-passivated Si sample patterned and passivated with independent Cl, Br, I, and bare Si regions was shown to maintain its integrity in all but the bare Si region post-exposure to an N2environment. The successful demonstration of the preservation of APAM patterns outside of UHV environments opens new possibilities for transporting atomically-precise devices outside of UHV for integrating with non-UHV processes, such as other chemistries and commercial semiconductor device processes.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/838837fb3c6e9423713158827bbaa965ed066a21,,E.

Methods Based on the signals approach, an Expert Panel reviewed published literature and research survey results on the observed frequency of less common in situ hybridization (ISH) patterns to update the recommendations. Recommendations Two recommendations addressed via correspondence in 2015 are included. First, immunohistochemistry (IHC) 2+ is defined as invasive breast cancer with weak to moderate complete membrane staining observed in > 10% of tumor cells. Second, if the initial HER2 test result in a core needle biopsy specimen of a primary breast cancer is negative, a new HER2 test may (not ""must"") be ordered on the excision specimen based on specific clinical criteria. The HER2 testing algorithm for breast cancer is updated to address the recommended work-up for less common clinical scenarios (approximately 5% of cases) observed when using a dual-probe ISH assay. These scenarios are described as ISH group 2 ( HER2/chromosome enumeration probe 17 [CEP17] ratio ≥ 2.0; average HER2 copy number < 4.0 signals per cell), ISH group 3 ( HER2/CEP17 ratio < 2.0; average HER2 copy number ≥ 6.0 signals per cell), and ISH group 4 ( HER2/CEP17 ratio < 2.0; average HER2 copy number ≥ 4.0 and < 6.0 signals per cell). The diagnostic approach includes more rigorous interpretation criteria for ISH and requires concomitant IHC review for dual-probe ISH groups 2 to 4 to arrive at the most accurate HER2 status designation (positive or negative) based on combined interpretation of the ISH and IHC assays. The Expert Panel recommends that laboratories using single-probe ISH assays include concomitant IHC review as part of the interpretation of all single-probe ISH assay results.

This paper presents a general theory of hierarchical stochastic processes and illustrates its use on the gamma process and the generalised gamma process. In general, most of the convenient properties of hierarchical Dirichlet processes extend to the broader family. The main construction for this corresponds to estimating the moments of an infinitely divisible distribution based on its cumulants. Various equivalences and relationships can then be applied to networks of hierarchical processes.

Previously, we have developed and demonstrated the utility of the internal coordinate molecular dynamics (MD) technique, generalized Newton-Euler inverse mass operator (GNEIMO), for refinement of small proteins. Using GNEIMO, the high-frequency degrees of freedom are frozen and the protein is modeled as a collection of rigid clusters connected by torsional hinges. This physical model allows larger integration time steps and focuses the conformational search in the low frequency torsional degrees of freedom. Here, we have applied GNEIMO with temperature replica exchange to refine low-resolution protein models of 30 proteins taken from the continuous assessment of structure prediction (CASP) competition. We have shown that GNEIMO torsional MD method leads to refinement of up to 1.3 Å in the root-mean-square deviation in coordinates for 30 CASP target proteins without using any experimental data as restraints in performing the GNEIMO simulations. This is in contrast with the unconstrained all-atom Cartesian MD method performed under the same conditions, where refinement requires the use of restraints during the simulations.",,,AB.
