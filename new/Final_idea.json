The TIM barrel protein, imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase from the hyperthermophilic organism Thermotoga maritima (tHisF), is well-suited for the construction of artificial metalloenzymes by this approach. To this end, we have generated a tHisF variant (tHisFEHH) with a Glu/His/His motif for metal ion coordination. Crystal structures of ZnII:tHisFEHH and NiII:tHisFEHH reveal that both metal ions bind to the engineered histidines. However, the two metals bind at distinct sites with different geometries, demonstrating the adaptability of tHisF. Only ZnII additionally ligates the Glu residue and adopts a tetrahedral geometry. The pseudo-octahedral NiII site comprises the two His and a native Ser residue. NiII:tHisFEHH catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of the flavanols quercetin and myricetin, providing an unprecedented example of an artificial metalloprotein with quercetinase activity."

In the present review, we extract and group the biochemical and structural properties of proteins that are advantageous in the design of artificial metalloenzymes; protein stability, pre-existing metal centre, native binding affinity for small molecules, confined and empty space, well-defined secondary structure, and native cellular location. The desirable properties highlight proteins as the key players in the design of metal-dependent biocatalysts.

As such, their design requires efforts to engineer substrate binding, in addition to accommodating the artificial catalyst. Here we constructed and characterised artificial metalloenzymes using alcohol dehydrogenase as starting point, an enzyme which has both a cofactor and a substrate binding pocket. A docking approach was used to determine suitable positions for catalyst anchoring to single cysteine mutants, leading to an artificial metalloenzyme capable to reduce both natural cofactors and the hydrophobic 1-benzylnicotinamide mimic. Kinetic studies revealed that the new construct displayed a Michaelis-Menten behaviour with the native nicotinamide cofactors, which were suggested by docking to bind at a surface exposed site, different compared to their native binding position. On the other hand, the kinetic and docking data suggested that a typical enzyme behaviour was not observed with the hydrophobic 1-benzylnicotinamide mimic, with which binding events were plausible both inside and outside the protein. This work demonstrates an extended substrate scope of the artificial metalloenzymes and provides information about the binding sites of the nicotinamide substrates, which can be exploited to further engineer artificial metalloenzymes for cofactor regeneration.

                "Chemical protein (semi-)synthesis is a powerful technique allowing the incorporation of unnatural functionalities at any desired protein site. Herein we describe a facile one-pot semi-synthetic strategy for the construction of a type 2 copper center in the active site of azurin, which is achieved by substitution of Met121 with unnatural amino acid residues bearing a strong ligand N,N-bis(pyridylmethyl)amine (DPA) to mimic the function of typical histidine brace-bearing copper monooxygenases, such as lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) involved in polysaccharide breakdown. The semi-synthetic proteins were routinely obtained in over 10-mg scales to allow for spectroscopic measurements (UV-Vis, CD, and EPR), which provides structural evidences for the CuII-DPA-modified azurins. 4-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (PNPG) was used as a model substrate for the H2O2-driven oxidative cleavage reaction facilitated by semi-synthetic azurins, and the CuII-6 complex showed a highest activity (TTN 253). Interestingly, our semi-synthetic azurins were able to tolerate high H2O2 concentrations (up to 4000-fold of the enzyme), making them promising for practical applications. Collectively, we establish that chemical protein synthesis can be exploited as a reliable technology in affording large quantities of artificial metalloproteins to facilitate the transformation of challenging chemical reactions."

                "Chemical protein (semi-)synthesis is a powerful technique allowing the incorporation of unnatural functionalities at any desired protein site. Herein we describe a facile one-pot semi-synthetic strategy for the construction of a type 2 copper center in the active site of azurin, which is achieved by substitution of Met121 with unnatural amino acid residues bearing a strong ligand N,N-bis(pyridylmethyl)amine (DPA) to mimic the function of typical histidine brace-bearing copper monooxygenases, such as lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) involved in polysaccharide breakdown. The semi-synthetic proteins were routinely obtained in over 10-mg scales to allow for spectroscopic measurements (UV-Vis, CD, and EPR), which provides structural evidences for the CuII-DPA-modified azurins. 4-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (PNPG) was used as a model substrate for the H2O2-driven oxidative cleavage reaction facilitated by semi-synthetic azurins, and the CuII-6 complex showed a highest activity (TTN 253). Interestingly, our semi-synthetic azurins were able to tolerate high H2O2 concentrations (up to 4000-fold of the enzyme), making them promising for practical applications. Collectively, we establish that chemical protein synthesis can be exploited as a reliable technology in affording large quantities of artificial metalloproteins to facilitate the transformation of challenging chemical reactions."

                "The design of artificial enzymes has emerged as a promising tool for the generation of potent biocatalysts able to promote new-to-nature reactions with improved catalytic performances, providing a powerful platform for wide-ranging applications and a better understanding of protein functions and structures. The selection of an appropriate protein scaffold plays a key role in the design process. This review aims to give a general overview of the most common protein scaffolds that can be exploited for the generation of artificial enzymes. Several examples are discussed and categorized according to the strategy used for the design of the artificial biocatalyst, namely the functionalization of natural enzymes, the creation of a new catalytic site in a protein scaffold bearing a wide hydrophobic pocket and de novo protein design. The review is concluded by a comparison of these different methods and by our perspective on the topic.",
                "A large fraction of metalloenzymes harbors multiple metal-centers that are electronically and/or functionally arranged within their proteinaceous environments. To explore the orchestration of inorganic and biochemical components and to develop bioinorganic catalysts and materials, we have described selected examples of artificial metalloproteins having multiple metallocofactors that were grouped depending on their initial protein scaffolds, the nature of introduced inorganic moieties, and the method used to propagate the number of metal ions within a protein. They demonstrated that diverse inorganic moieties can be selectively grafted and modulated in protein environments, providing a retrosynthetic bottom-up approach in the design of versatile and proficient biocatalysts and biomimetic model systems to explore fundamental questions in bioinorganic chemistry.",
