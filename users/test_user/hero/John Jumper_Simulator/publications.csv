Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'8-has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known.

This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)-a blind assessment of the state of the field-AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains.

However, developing devices capable of free-standing inter- and intracellular operation is an important next step in designing new synthetic cellular materials and tools for biophysical characterization. To demonstrate this, here we show that label free SiNWs can be internalized in multiple cell lines, forming robust cytoskeletal interfaces, and when kinked can serve as free-standing inter- and intracellular force probes capable of continuous extended (>1 h) force monitoring. Our results show that intercellular interactions exhibit ratcheting like behavior with force peaks of ∼69.6 pN/SiNW, while intracellular force peaks of ∼116.9 pN/SiNW were recorded during smooth muscle contraction. To accomplish this, we have introduced a simple single-capture dark-field/phase contrast optical imaging modality, scatter enhanced phase contrast (SEPC), which enables the simultaneous visualization of both cellular components and inorganic nanostructures.

We re-examine this trade-off in the more realistic regime in which parameterization is a greater source of error than the level of detail in the force field. To address parameterization of coarse-grained force fields, we use the contrastive divergence technique from machine learning to train from simulations of 450 proteins. In our procedure, the computational efficiency of the model enables high accuracy through the precise tuning of the Boltzmann ensemble. This method is applied to our recently developed Upside model, where the free energy for side chains is rapidly calculated at every time-step, allowing for a smooth energy landscape without steric rattling of the side chains. After this contrastive divergence training, the model is able to de novo fold proteins up to 100 residues on a single core in days.

A central characteristic of glass-forming liquids is a non-exponential main relaxation process. The extent of deviation from exponential relaxation typically becomes more pronounced on cooling. Theories that predict a growth of spatially heterogeneous dynamics as temperature is lowered can explain these observations. In apparent contradiction to these theories, however, some experiments suggest that certain substances--notably including the intensely studied molecular glass-former ortho-terphenyl (OTP)--have a main relaxation process whose shape is essentially temperature independent, even though other observables predicted to be correlated with the degree of dynamical heterogeneity are temperature dependent. Here we report the first simulations based on an atomistic model of OTP that reach equilibrium at temperatures well into the supercooled regime. We first show that the results of these simulations are in reasonable quantitative agreement with experimental data for several basic properties over a wide range of temperatures. We then focus on rotational relaxation, finding nearly exponential behavior at high temperatures with clearly increasing deviations as temperature is lowered. The much weaker temperature dependence observed in light-scattering experiments also emerges from the same simulation data when we calculate correlation functions similar to those probed experimentally; this highlights the diversity of temperature dependencies that can be obtained with different probes. Further analysis suggests that the temperature insensitivity observed in the light-scattering experiments stems from the dependence of these measurements on internal as well as rotational molecular motion. Within the temperature range of our OTP simulations, our results strongly suggest that this archetypal glass-former behaves as anticipated by theories of the glass transition that predict increasing non-exponentiality with cooling, and our simulations thus strengthen the evidence supporting such theories.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/091c14f2f9ecb37c0229edb7ec63939654c62529,"The first simulations based on an atomistic model of OTP that reach equilibrium at temperatures well into the supercooled regime and focus on rotational relaxation, finding nearly exponential behavior at high temperatures with clearly increasing deviations as temperature is lowered.",MP.

To make data from a large array of model providers more easily accessible to the broader scientific community, we established 3D-Beacons, a collaborative initiative to create a federated network with unified data access mechanisms. The 3D-Beacons Network allows researchers to collate coordinate files and metadata for experimentally determined and theoretical protein models from state-of-the-art and specialist model providers and also from the Protein Data Bank.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fc6764e0ff4379ba1c08ae0dad31322321ead864,The 3D-Beacons Network allows researchers to collate coordinate files and metadata for experimentally determined and theoretical protein models from state-of-the-art and specialist model providers and also from the Protein Data Bank.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address parameterization of coarse-grained forcefields, we use the contrastive divergence technique from machine learning to train directly from simulation trajectories on 450 proteins.

After our contrastive divergence training, the model is able to fold proteins up to approximately 100 residues de novo on a single core in CPU core-days.

How to accurately identify DNA-binding residues from only protein sequence remains a challenging task. Currently, most existing sequence-based methods only consider contextual features of the sequential neighbors, which are limited to capture spatial information. Based on the recent breakthrough in protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2, we propose an accurate predictor, GraphSite, for identifying DNA-binding residues based on the structural models predicted by AlphaFold2. Here, we convert the binding site prediction problem into a graph node classification task and employ a transformer-based variant model to take the protein structural information into account. By leveraging predicted protein structures and graph transformer, GraphSite substantially improves over the latest sequence-based and structure-based methods. The algorithm is further confirmed on the independent test set of 181 proteins, where GraphSite surpasses the state-of-the-art structure-based method by 16.4% in area under the precision-recall curve and 11.2% in Matthews correlation coefficient, respectively.

We challenge the current status quo and advocate that AF2 has indeed learned some protein folding principles, despite being designed for structure prediction. AF2's high-dimensional parameters encode an imperfect biophysical scoring function. Typically, AF2 uses multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to guide the search within a narrow region of its learned surface. In our study, we operate AF2 without MSAs or initial templates, forcing it to sample its entire energy landscape - more akin to an ab initio approach. Among over 7,000 proteins, a fraction fold using sequence alone, highlighting the smoothness of AF2's learned energy surface. Additionally, by combining recycling and iterative predictions, we discover multiple AF2 intermediate structures in good agreement with known experimental data. AF2 appears to follow a ""local first, global later"" folding mechanism.

It predicts protein structure by building an alignment between the query sequence under prediction and the templates with solved structures. However, it is still very challenging to build the optimal sequence-template alignment, especially when only distantly related templates are available. Here we report a novel deep learning approach ProALIGN that can predict much more accurate sequence-template alignment. Like protein sequences consisting of sequence motifs, protein alignments are also composed of frequently occurring alignment motifs with characteristic patterns. Alignment motifs are context-specific as their characteristic patterns are tightly related to sequence contexts of the aligned regions. Inspired by this observation, we represent a protein alignment as a binary matrix (in which 1 denotes an aligned residue pair) and then use a deep convolutional neural network to predict the optimal alignment from the query protein and its template. The trained neural network implicitly but effectively encodes an alignment scoring function, which reduces inaccuracies in the handcrafted scoring functions widely used by the current threading approaches. For a query protein and a template, we apply the neural network to directly infer likelihoods of all possible residue pairs in their entirety, which could effectively consider the correlations among multiple residues. We further construct the alignment with maximum likelihood, and finally build a structure model according to the alignment. Tested on three independent data sets with a total of 6688 protein alignment targets and 80 CASP13 TBM targets, our method achieved much better alignments and 3D structure models than the existing methods, including HHpred, CNFpred, CEthreader, and DeepThreader.

Protein structure prediction using geometric attention neural networks,"John Jumper, Andrew W Senior, Richard Andrew Evans, Stephan Gouws, Alexander Bridgland",2021,0,{},"US Patent App. 16/701,070, 2021",,,,,,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Zm_yQOtbf3EJ:scholar.google.com/,,,,,,,,"Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have led to an explosion of genomic and transcriptomic data, offering a wealth of protein sequence information. However, the functions of most proteins remain unannotated. Traditional experimental methods for annotation of protein functions are costly and time-consuming. Current deep learning methods typically rely on Graph Convolutional Networks to propagate features between protein residues. However, these methods fail to capture fine atomic-level geometric structural features and cannot directly compute or propagate structural features (such as distances, directions, and angles) when transmitting features, often simplifying them to scalars. Additionally, difficulties in capturing long-range dependencies limit the model's ability to identify key nodes (residues). To address these challenges, we propose a geometric graph network (GGN-GO) for predicting protein function that enriches feature extraction by capturing multi-scale geometric structural features at the atomic and residue levels. We use a geometric vector perceptron to convert these features into vector representations and aggregate them with node features for better understanding and propagation in the network. Moreover, we introduce a graph attention pooling layer captures key node information by adaptively aggregating local functional motifs, while contrastive learning enhances graph representation discriminability through random noise and different views. The experimental results show that GGN-GO outperforms six comparative methods in tasks with the most labels for both experimentally validated and predicted protein structures. Furthermore, GGN-GO identifies functional residues corresponding to those experimentally confirmed, showcasing its interpretability and the ability to pinpoint key protein regions.
