        "abstract": "DeepMind presented notably accurate predictions at the recent 14th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP14) conference. We explored network architectures that incorporate related ideas and obtained the best performance with a three-track network in which information at the one-dimensional (1D) sequence level, the 2D distance map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated. The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.",

        "abstract": "Much of the complexity within cells arises from functional and regulatory interactions among proteins. The core of these interactions is increasingly known, but novel interactions continue to be discovered, and the information remains scattered across different database resources, experimental modalities and levels of mechanistic detail. The STRING database (https://string-db.org/) systematically collects and integrates protein-protein interactions-both physical interactions as well as functional associations. The data originate from a number of sources: automated text mining of the scientific literature, computational interaction predictions from co-expression, conserved genomic context, databases of interaction experiments and known complexes/pathways from curated sources. All of these interactions are critically assessed, scored, and subsequently automatically transferred to less well-studied organisms using hierarchical orthology information. The data can be accessed via the website, but also programmatically and via bulk downloads. The most recent developments in STRING (version 12.0) are: (i) it is now possible to create, browse and analyze a full interaction network for any novel genome of interest, by submitting its complement of encoded proteins, (ii) the co-expression channel now uses variational auto-encoders to predict interactions, and it covers two new sources, single-cell RNA-seq and experimental proteomics data and (iii) the confidence in each experimentally derived interaction is now estimated based on the detection method used, and communicated to the user in the web-interface. Furthermore, STRING continues to enhance its facilities for functional enrichment analysis, which are now fully available also for user-submitted genomes.",

The recent characterization of the refolding of a number of simple, single domain proteins has provided a means of testing these assertions. Our investigations have revealed statistically significant correlations between the average sequence separation between contacting residues in the native state and the rate and transition state placement of folding for a non-homologous set of simple, single domain proteins. These indicate that proteins featuring primarily sequence-local contacts tend to fold more rapidly and exhibit less compact folding transition states than those characterized by more non-local interactions. No significant relationship is apparent between protein length and folding rates, but a weak correlation is observed between length and the fraction of solvent-exposed surface area buried in the transition state. Anticipated strong relationships between equilibrium folding free energy and folding kinetics, or between chemical denaturant and temperature dependence-derived measures of transition state placement, are not apparent. The observed correlations are consistent with a model of protein folding in which the size and stability of the polypeptide segments organized in the transition state are largely independent of protein length, but are related to the topological complexity of the native state. The correlation between topological complexity and folding rates may reflect chain entropy contributions to the folding barrier.",

Simple image- and text-recognition tasks have been successfully 'crowd-sourced' through games, but it is not clear if more complex scientific problems can be solved with human-directed computing. Protein structure prediction is one such problem: locating the biologically relevant native conformation of a protein is a formidable computational challenge given the very large size of the search space. Here we describe Foldit, a multiplayer online game that engages non-scientists in solving hard prediction problems. Foldit players interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and user-friendly versions of algorithms from the Rosetta structure prediction methodology, while they compete and collaborate to optimize the computed energy. We show that top-ranked Foldit players excel at solving challenging structure refinement problems in which substantial backbone rearrangements are necessary to achieve the burial of hydrophobic residues. Players working collaboratively develop a rich assortment of new strategies and algorithms; unlike computational approaches, they explore not only the conformational space but also the space of possible search strategies. The integration of human visual problem-solving and strategy development capabilities with traditional computational algorithms through interactive multiplayer games is a powerful new approach to solving computationally-limited scientific problems.",

Environment and residue pair specific contributions to the scoring functions appear as the first two terms in a series expansion for the residue probability distributions in the protein database; the decoupling of the distance and environment dependencies of the distributions resolves the major problems with current database-derived scoring functions noted by Thomas and Dill. The simulated annealing procedure rapidly and frequently generates native-like structures for small helical proteins and better than random structures for small beta sheet containing proteins. Most of the simulated structures have native-like solvent accessibility and secondary structure patterns, and thus ensembles of these structures provide a particularly challenging set of decoys for evaluating scoring functions. We investigate the effects of multiple sequence information and different types of conformational constraints on the overall performance of the method, and the ability of a variety of recently developed scoring functions to recognize the native-like conformations in the ensembles of simulated structures.",

Hyper-reactivity was a rare feature among cysteines and it was found to specify a wide range of activities, including nucleophilic and reductive catalysis and sites of oxidative modification. Hyper-reactive cysteines were identified in several proteins of uncharacterized function, including a residue conserved across eukaryotic phylogeny that we show is required for yeast viability and is involved in iron-sulphur protein biogenesis.

Essentially, it is the core of the ontology based application systems and needs to be invoked frequently. For this reason, an appropriate method must be adopted to store the semantic Web rough ontology in order to guarantee enough ontology access efficiency. Based on the definition and the model of the semantic Web rough ontology, and considering that relational database is one of the most common storage media, a semantic Web rough ontology storage method based on relational database is proposed. Furthermore, a storage mode is designed and discussed deeply. Based on the designed storage mode, a constructed semantic Web rough ontology can be easily stored into a relational database.

Although trained entirely on native proteins, the network consistently assigns higher probability to de novo-designed proteins, identifying the key fold-determining residues and providing an independent quantitative measure of the \"ideality\" of a protein structure.

Up to 10(5) independent simulations are carried out, and the resulting \"decoys\" are ranked using an energy function dominated by van der Waals interactions, an implicit solvation model, and an orientation-dependent hydrogen bonding potential. Top-ranking decoys are clustered to select the final predictions. Small-perturbation studies reveal the formation of binding funnels in 42 of 54 cases using coordinates derived from the bound complexes and in 32 of 54 cases using independently determined coordinates of one or both monomers. Experimental binding affinities correlate with the calculated score function and explain the predictive success or failure of many targets. Global searches using one or both unbound components predict at least 25% of the native residue-residue contacts in 28 of the 32 cases where binding funnels exist. The results suggest that the method may soon be useful for generating models of biologically important complexes from the structures of the isolated components, but they also highlight the challenges that must be met to achieve consistent and accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions.",

However, such personalization of drug treatments requires the ability to predict how different individuals will respond to a particular drug/dose combination. After initial optimism, there is increasing recognition of the limitations of the pharmacogenomic approach, which does not take account of important environmental influences on drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. For instance, a major factor underlying inter-individual variation in drug effects is variation in metabolic phenotype, which is influenced not only by genotype but also by environmental factors such as nutritional status, the gut microbiota, age, disease and the co- or pre-administration of other drugs. Thus, although genetic variation is clearly important, it seems unlikely that personalized drug therapy will be enabled for a wide range of major diseases using genomic knowledge alone. Here we describe an alternative and conceptually new 'pharmaco-metabonomic' approach to personalizing drug treatment, which uses a combination of pre-dose metabolite profiling and chemometrics to model and predict the responses of individual subjects. We provide proof-of-principle for this new approach, which is sensitive to both genetic and environmental influences, with a study of paracetamol (acetaminophen) administered to rats.

The model successfully predicts the results of alanine scanning experiments on globular proteins (743 mutations) and 19 protein-protein interfaces (233 mutations) with average unsigned errors of 0.81 kcal/mol and 1.06 kcal/mol, respectively. The results test our understanding of the dominant contributions to the free energy of protein-protein interactions, can guide experiments aimed at the design of protein interaction inhibitors, and provide a stepping-stone to important applications such as interface redesign.",

        "abstract": "Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a secreted cytokine that regulates cell proliferation, migration, and the differentiation of a plethora of different cell types. Consistent with these findings, TGF-β plays a key role in controlling embryogenic development, inflammation, and tissue repair, as well as in maintaining adult tissue homeostasis. TGF-β elicits a broad range of context-dependent cellular responses, and consequently, alterations in TGF-β signaling have been implicated in many diseases, including cancer. During the early stages of tumorigenesis, TGF-β acts as a tumor suppressor by inducing cytostasis and the apoptosis of normal and premalignant cells. However, at later stages, when cancer cells have acquired oncogenic mutations and/or have lost tumor suppressor gene function, cells are resistant to TGF-β-induced growth arrest, and TGF-β functions as a tumor promotor by stimulating tumor cells to undergo the so-called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The latter leads to metastasis and chemotherapy resistance. TGF-β further supports cancer growth and progression by activating tumor angiogenesis and cancer-associated fibroblasts and enabling the tumor to evade inhibitory immune responses. In this review, we will consider the role of TGF-β signaling in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, EMT and cancer cell metastasis. In particular, we will highlight recent insights into the multistep and dynamically controlled process of TGF-β-induced EMT and the functions of miRNAs and long noncoding RNAs in this process. Finally, we will discuss how these new mechanistic insights might be exploited to develop novel therapeutic interventions.",

A robust protocol is described that exploits this relation for de novo protein structure generation, using as input experimental parameters the (13)C(alpha), (13)C(beta), (13)C', (15)N, (1)H(alpha) and (1)H(N) NMR chemical shifts. These shifts are generally available at the early stage of the traditional NMR structure determination process, before the collection and analysis of structural restraints. The chemical shift based structure determination protocol uses an empirically optimized procedure to select protein fragments from the Protein Data Bank, in conjunction with the standard ROSETTA Monte Carlo assembly and relaxation methods. Evaluation of 16 proteins, varying in size from 56 to 129 residues, yielded full-atom models that have 0.7-1.8 A root mean square deviations for the backbone atoms relative to the experimentally determined x-ray or NMR structures. The strategy also has been successfully applied in a blind manner to nine protein targets with molecular masses up to 15.4 kDa, whose conventional NMR structure determination was conducted in parallel by the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium. This protocol potentially provides a new direction for high-throughput NMR structure determination.",

Predose and postdose urinary metabolite profiles were determined by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. The predose spectra were statistically analyzed in relation to drug metabolite excretion to detect predose biomarkers of drug fate and a human-gut microbiome cometabolite predictor was identified. Thus, we found that individuals having high predose urinary levels of p-cresol sulfate had low postdose urinary ratios of acetaminophen sulfate to acetaminophen glucuronide. We conclude that, in individuals with high bacterially mediated p-cresol generation, competitive O-sulfonation of p-cresol reduces the effective systemic capacity to sulfonate acetaminophen. Given that acetaminophen is such a widely used and seemingly well-understood drug, this finding provides a clear demonstration of the immense potential and power of the pharmacometabonomic approach. However, we expect many other sulfonation reactions to be similarly affected by competition with p-cresol and our finding also has important implications for certain diseases as well as for the variable responses induced by many different drugs and xenobiotics. We propose that assessing the effects of microbiome activity should be an integral part of pharmaceutical development and of personalized health care. Furthermore, we envisage that gut bacterial populations might be deliberately manipulated to improve drug efficacy and to reduce adverse drug reactions.",

Withdrawal from repeated cocaine reduced in vivo extracellular glutamate in the nucleus accumbens of rats by decreasing the exchange of extracellular cystine for intracellular glutamate. In vivo restoration of cystine/glutamate exchange by intracranial perfusion of cystine or systemically administered N-acetylcysteine normalized the levels of glutamate in cocaine-treated subjects. To determine if the reduction in nonvesicular glutamate release is a mediator of relapse, we examined cocaine-primed reinstatement of drug seeking after cocaine self-administration was stopped. Reinstatement was prevented by stimulating cystine/glutamate exchange with N-acetylcysteine and restoring extracellular glutamate. Thus, withdrawal from repeated cocaine increases susceptibility to relapse in part by reducing cystine/glutamate exchange, and restoring exchanger activity prevents cocaine-primed drug seeking.",

We provide insight into the mechanism of dynamic instability, based on high-resolution cryo-EM structures (4.7-5.6 Å) of dynamic microtubules and microtubules stabilized by GMPCPP or Taxol. We infer that hydrolysis leads to a compaction around the E-site nucleotide at longitudinal interfaces, as well as movement of the α-tubulin intermediate domain and H7 helix. Displacement of the C-terminal helices in both α- and β-tubulin subunits suggests an effect on interactions with binding partners that contact this region. Taxol inhibits most of these conformational changes, allosterically inducing a GMPCPP-like state. Lateral interactions are similar in all conditions we examined, suggesting that microtubule lattice stability is primarily modulated at longitudinal interfaces.",

We then determine the conditions under which these predicted contacts are likely to be useful for structure modeling and identify more than 400 protein families where these conditions are currently met. Recently developed methods have shown considerable promise in predicting residue–residue contacts in protein 3D structures using evolutionary covariance information. However, these methods require large numbers of evolutionarily related sequences to robustly assess the extent of residue covariation, and the larger the protein family, the more likely that contact information is unnecessary because a reasonable model can be built based on the structure of a homolog. Here we describe a method that integrates sequence coevolution and structural context information using a pseudolikelihood approach, allowing more accurate contact predictions from fewer homologous sequences. We rigorously assess the utility of predicted contacts for protein structure prediction using large and representative sequence and structure databases from recent structure prediction experiments. We find that contact predictions are likely to be accurate when the number of aligned sequences (with sequence redundancy reduced to 90%) is greater than five times the length of the protein, and that accurate predictions are likely to be useful for structure modeling if the aligned sequences are more similar to the protein of interest than to the closest homolog of known structure.

The scoring function used in the simulated annealing procedure consists of sequence-dependent terms representing hydrophobic burial and specific pair interactions such as electrostatics and disulfide bonding and sequence-independent terms representing hard sphere packing, alpha-helix and beta-strand packing, and the collection of beta-strands in beta-sheets (Simons et al., Proteins 1999;34:82-95). For each of 21 small, ab initio targets, 1,200 final structures were constructed, each the result of 100,000 attempted fragment substitutions. The five structures submitted for the CASP III experiment were chosen from the approximately 25 structures with the lowest scores in the broadest minima (assessed through the number of structural neighbors; Shortle et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1998;95:1158-1162). The results were encouraging: highlights of the predictions include a 99-residue segment for MarA with an rmsd of 6.4 A to the native structure, a 95-residue (full length) prediction for the EH2 domain of EPS15 with an rmsd of 6.0 A, a 75-residue segment of DNAB helicase with an rmsd of 4.7 A, and a 67-residue segment of ribosomal protein L30 with an rmsd of 3.8 A.

Despite this progress, a general deep-learning framework for protein design that enables solution of a wide range of design challenges, including de novo binder design and design of higher-order symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion models10,11 have had considerable success in image and language generative modelling but limited success when applied to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry and sequence-structure relationships. Here we show that by fine-tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the design of diverse functional proteins from simple molecular specifications.",

        "abstract": "Basal extracellular glutamate sampled in vivo is present in micromolar concentrations in the extracellular space outside the synaptic cleft, and neither the origin nor the function of this glutamate is known. This report reveals that blockade of glutamate release from the cystine-glutamate antiporter produced a significant decrease (60%) in extrasynaptic glutamate levels in the rat striatum, whereas blockade of voltage-dependent Na+ and Ca2+ channels produced relatively minimal changes (0-30%). This indicates that the primary origin of in vivo extrasynaptic glutamate in the striatum arises from nonvesicular glutamate release by the cystine-glutamate antiporter. By measuring [35S]cystine uptake, it was shown that similar to vesicular release, the activity of the cystine-glutamate antiporter is negatively regulated by group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3) via a cAMP-dependent protein kinase mechanism. Extracellular glutamate derived from the antiporter was shown to regulate extracellular levels of glutamate and dopamine. Infusion of the mGluR2/3 antagonist (RS)-1-amino-5-phosphonoindan-1-carboxylic acid (APICA) increased extracellular glutamate levels, and previous blockade of the antiporter prevented the APICA-induced rise in extracellular glutamate. This suggests that glutamate released from the antiporter is a source of endogenous tone on mGluR2/3. Blockade of the antiporter also produced an increase in extracellular dopamine that was reversed by infusing the mGluR2/3 agonist (2R,4R)-4-aminopyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxlylate, indicating that antiporter-derived glutamate can modulate dopamine transmission via mGluR2/3 heteroreceptors. These results suggest that nonvesicular release from the cystine-glutamate antiporter is the primary source of in vivo extracellular glutamate and that this glutamate can modulate both glutamate and dopamine transmission.",

Here, we explore the performance of protocols which sample an increasing diversity of conformations. We find that surprisingly similar performances in predicting changes in stability are achieved using protocols that involve very different amounts of conformational sampling, provided that the resolution of the force field is matched to the resolution of the sampling method. Methods involving backbone sampling can in some cases closely recapitulate the structural changes accompanying mutations but not surprisingly tend to do more harm than good in cases where structural changes are negligible. Analysis of the outliers in the stability change calculations suggests areas needing particular improvement; these include the balance between desolvation and the formation of favorable buried polar interactions, and unfolded state modeling.",

However, very little is known about how collaborative gameplay produces these results and whether Foldit player strategies can be formalized and structured so that they can be used by computers. To determine whether high performing player strategies could be collectively codified, we augmented the Foldit gameplay mechanics with tools for players to encode their folding strategies as \"recipes\" and to share their recipes with other players, who are able to further modify and redistribute them. Here we describe the rapid social evolution of player-developed folding algorithms that took place in the year following the introduction of these tools. Players developed over 5,400 different recipes, both by creating new algorithms and by modifying and recombining successful recipes developed by other players. The most successful recipes rapidly spread through the Foldit player population, and two of the recipes became particularly dominant. Examination of the algorithms encoded in these two recipes revealed a striking similarity to an unpublished algorithm developed by scientists over the same period. Benchmark calculations show that the new algorithm independently discovered by scientists and by Foldit players outperforms previously published methods. Thus, online scientific game frameworks have the potential not only to solve hard scientific problems, but also to discover and formalize effective new strategies and algorithms.",

Computer-generated scaffolds were either built around an ACE2 helix that interacts with the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) or docked against the RBD to identify new binding modes, and their amino acid sequences were designed to optimize target binding, folding, and stability. Ten designs bound the RBD, with affinities ranging from 100 picomolar to 10 nanomolar, and blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with median inhibitory concentration (IC50) values between 24 picomolar and 35 nanomolar. The most potent, with new binding modes, are 56- and 64-residue proteins (IC50 ~ 0.16 nanograms per milliliter).

The efficacies of a wide variety of sequence-dependent and sequence-independent features of protein structures for recognizing native-like structures were systematically evaluated using ensembles of approximately 30,000 compact conformations with fixed secondary structure for each of 17 small protein domains. The best results were obtained using a core scoring function with P(sequence/structure) parameterized similarly to our previous work (Simons et al., J Mol Biol 1997;268:209-225] and P(structure) focused on secondary structure packing preferences; while several additional features had some discriminatory power on their own, they did not provide any additional discriminatory power when combined with the core scoring function.

In more than half the cases, at least one of the top five models agrees with the native structure to better than 4 A rmsd over the backbone. Most importantly, the method recapitulates more than one-third of non-Watson-Crick base pairs seen in the native structures. Tandem stacks of \"sheared\" base pairs, base triplets, and pseudoknots are among the noncanonical features reproduced in the models. In the cases in which none of the top five models were native-like, higher energy conformations similar to the native structures are still sampled frequently but not assigned low energies.

Our results indicate that peptides from structure-based designs can disrupt the fibril formation of full-length proteins, including those, such as tau protein, that lack fully ordered native structures.

Rats were first trained to self-administer cocaine or received yoked saline administration (\"control\"). They then received 21 daily exposures to either the self-administration environment (\"extinction\") or a different environment (\"no extinction\") without cocaine available. Extinction training, used to decrease incentive motivation for cocaine elicited by the self-administration environment, decreased cocaine-seeking behavior elicited by both the environment and the cocaine priming injection. Exposure to the self-administration environment enhanced Fos expression in the no extinction group relative to control and extinction groups in the anterior cingulate, basolateral amygdala, hippocampal CA1 region, dentate gyrus, nucleus accumbens shell and core, and central gray area, regardless of whether or not priming injections were given. The priming injections enhanced Fos expression in the ventral tegmental area, caudate putamen, substantia nigra pars reticulata, entorhinal cortex, central amygdala, lateral amygdala, arcuate nucleus, and central gray area, regardless of group. Thus, these changes likely reflect an unconditioned effect from either cocaine or injection stress. The priming injections also enhanced Fos expression in the anterior cingulate, but only in cocaine-experienced groups, suggesting that this enhancement reflects an experience-dependent motivational effect of the priming injections. The results suggest that different neural circuits may be involved in the incentive motivational effects of cocaine-paired environmental stimuli versus priming injections and that the anterior cingulate may be part of a common pathway for both.",

Thus far, land, freshwater, and ocean exploitation have been the chief causes of biodiversity loss. Climate change is projected to be a rapidly increasing additional driver for biodiversity loss. Since climate change and biodiversity loss impact human societies everywhere, bold solutions are required that integrate environmental and societal objectives. As yet, most existing international biodiversity targets have overlooked climate change impacts. At the same time, climate change mitigation measures themselves may harm biodiversity directly. The Convention on Biological Diversity's post-2020 framework offers the important opportunity to address the interactions between climate change and biodiversity and revise biodiversity targets accordingly by better aligning these with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. We identify the considerable number of existing and proposed post-2020 biodiversity targets that risk being severely compromised due to climate change, even if other barriers to their achievement were removed. Our analysis suggests that the next set of biodiversity targets explicitly addresses climate change-related risks since many aspirational goals will not be feasible under even lower-end projections of future warming. Adopting more flexible and dynamic approaches to conservation, rather than static goals, would allow us to respond flexibly to changes in habitats, genetic resources, species composition, and ecosystem functioning and leverage biodiversity's capacity to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation.",

Here we investigate whether the information captured by such networks is sufficiently rich to generate new folded proteins with sequences unrelated to those of the naturally occurring proteins used in training the models. We generate random amino acid sequences, and input them into the trRosetta structure prediction network to predict starting residue-residue distance maps, which, as expected, are quite featureless. We then carry out Monte Carlo sampling in amino acid sequence space, optimizing the contrast (Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the inter-residue distance distributions predicted by the network and background distributions averaged over all proteins. Optimization from different random starting points resulted in novel proteins spanning a wide range of sequences and predicted structures. We obtained synthetic genes encoding 129 of the network-'hallucinated' sequences, and expressed and purified the proteins in Escherichia coli; 27 of the proteins yielded monodisperse species with circular dichroism spectra consistent with the hallucinated structures. We determined the three-dimensional structures of three of the hallucinated proteins, two by X-ray crystallography and one by NMR, and these closely matched the hallucinated models. Thus, deep networks trained to predict native protein structures from their sequences can be inverted to design new proteins, and such networks and methods should contribute alongside traditional physics-based models to the de novo design of proteins with new functions.",

Despite very little sequence similarity, the approximately 60 residue IgG binding domains of protein G and protein L both consist of a single helix packed against a four-stranded sheet formed by two symmetrically disposed beta-hairpins. We demonstrate that, as in the case of protein L, one of the two beta-turns of protein G is formed and the other disrupted in the folding transition state. Unlike protein L, however, in protein G it is the second beta-turn that is formed in the folding transition state ensemble. Substitution of an Asp residue by Ala in protein G that eliminates an i,i+2 side chain-main chain hydrogen bond in the second beta-turn slows the folding rate approximately 20-fold but has virtually no effect on the unfolding rate. Taken together with previous results, these findings suggest that the presence of an intact beta-turn in the folding transition state is a consequence of the overall topology of protein L and protein G, but the particular hairpin that is formed is determined by the detailed interatomic interactions that determine the free energies of formation of the isolated beta-hairpins.",

        "abstract": "In human addicts, drug relapse and craving are often provoked by stress. Since 1995, this clinical scenario has been studied using a rat model of stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. Here, we first discuss the generality of stress-induced reinstatement to different drugs of abuse, different stressors, and different behavioral procedures. We also discuss neuropharmacological mechanisms, and brain areas and circuits controlling stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. We conclude by discussing results from translational human laboratory studies and clinical trials that were inspired by results from rat studies on stress-induced reinstatement. Our main conclusions are (1) The phenomenon of stress-induced reinstatement, first shown with an intermittent footshock stressor in rats trained to self-administer heroin, generalizes to other abused drugs, including cocaine, methamphetamine, nicotine, and alcohol, and is also observed in the conditioned place preference model in rats and mice. This phenomenon, however, is stressor specific and not all stressors induce reinstatement of drug seeking. (2) Neuropharmacological studies indicate the involvement of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), noradrenaline, dopamine, glutamate, kappa/dynorphin, and several other peptide and neurotransmitter systems in stress-induced reinstatement. Neuropharmacology and circuitry studies indicate the involvement of CRF and noradrenaline transmission in bed nucleus of stria terminalis and central amygdala, and dopamine, CRF, kappa/dynorphin, and glutamate transmission in other components of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system (ventral tegmental area, medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens). (3) Translational human laboratory studies and a recent clinical trial study show the efficacy of alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists in decreasing stress-induced drug craving and stress-induced initial heroin lapse.",

Kinetic analysis of mutations at 52 of the 57 residues in the src SH3 domain revealed that the transition state ensemble is even more polarized than suspected earlier: no single alanine substitution in the N-terminal 15 residues or the C-terminal 9 residues has more than a two-fold effect on the folding rate, while such substitutions at 15 sites in the central three-stranded beta-sheet cause significant decreases in the folding rate. Molecular dynamics (MD) unfolding simulations and ab initio folding simulations on the src SH3 domain exhibit a hierarchy of folding similar to that observed in the experiments. The similarity in folding mechanism of different SH3 domains and the similar hierarchy of structure formation observed in the experiments and the simulations can be largely accounted for by a simple native state topology-based model of protein folding energy landscapes.",

The approach builds on experiments showing that hexapeptides are sufficient for forming amyloid-like fibrils. Each six-residue peptide of a protein of interest is mapped onto an ensemble of templates, or 3D profile, generated from the crystal structure of the peptide NNQQNY by small displacements of one of the two intermeshed beta-sheets relative to the other. The energy of each mapping of a sequence to the profile is evaluated by using ROSETTADESIGN, and the lowest energy match for a given peptide to the template library is taken as the putative prediction. If the energy of the putative prediction is lower than a threshold value, a prediction of fibril formation is made. This method can reach an accuracy of approximately 80% with a P value of approximately 10(-12) when a conservative energy threshold is used to separate peptides that form fibrils from those that do not. We see enrichment for positive predictions in a set of fibril-forming segments of amyloid proteins, and we illustrate the method with applications to proteins of interest in amyloid research.",

The predicted geometries are then transformed as restraints to guide the structure prediction on the basis of direct energy minimization, which is implemented under the framework of Rosetta. The trRosetta server distinguishes itself from other similar structure prediction servers in terms of rapid and accurate de novo structure prediction. As an illustration, trRosetta was applied to two Pfam families with unknown structures, for which the predicted de novo models were estimated to have high accuracy. Nevertheless, to take advantage of homology modeling, homologous templates are used as additional inputs to the network automatically. In general, it takes ~1 h to predict the final structure for a typical protein with ~300 amino acids, using a maximum of 10 CPU cores in parallel in our cluster system.

The configurations considered by the model contain one or two contiguous stretches of residues ordered as in the native structure with all other residues completely disordered; the free energy of each configuration is the difference between the entropic cost of ordering the residues, which depends on the total number of residues ordered and the length of the loop between the two ordered segments, and the favorable attractive interactions, which are taken to be proportional to the total surface area buried by the ordered residues in the native structure. Folding kinetics are modeled by allowing only one residue to become ordered/disordered at a time, and a rigorous and exact method is used to identify free-energy maxima on the lowest free-energy paths connecting the fully disordered and fully ordered configurations. The distribution of structure in these free-energy maxima, which comprise the transition-state ensemble in the model, are reasonably consistent with experimental data on the folding transition state for five of seven proteins studied. Thus, the model appears to capture, at least in part, the basic physics underlying protein folding and the aspects of native-state topology that determine protein-folding mechanisms.",

The query sequence is scanned for segments 7 to 19 residues in length that strongly match one of the 82 patterns in the library. Matching segments are assigned the three-dimensional structure characteristic of the corresponding sequence pattern, and backbone torsion angles for the entire query sequence are then predicted by piecing together mutually compatible segment predictions. In predictions of local structure in a test set of 55 proteins, about 50% of all residues, and 76% of residues covered by high-confidence predictions, were found in eight-residue segments within 1.4 A of their true structures.

The development of genetically engineered malaria-resistant mosquitoes has shown, as a proof of principle, the possibility of targeting the mosquito's ability to serve as a disease vector. The translation of these achievements into control measures requires an effective technology to spread a genetic modification from laboratory mosquitoes to field populations. We have suggested previously that homing endonuclease genes (HEGs), a class of simple selfish genetic elements, could be exploited for this purpose. Here we demonstrate that a synthetic genetic element, consisting of mosquito regulatory regions and the homing endonuclease gene I-SceI, can substantially increase its transmission to the progeny in transgenic mosquitoes of the human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. We show that the I-SceI element is able to invade receptive mosquito cage populations rapidly, validating mathematical models for the transmission dynamics of HEGs. Molecular analyses confirm that expression of I-SceI in the male germline induces high rates of site-specific chromosomal cleavage and gene conversion, which results in the gain of the I-SceI gene, and underlies the observed genetic drive. These findings demonstrate a new mechanism by which genetic control measures can be implemented. Our results also show in principle how sequence-specific genetic drive elements like HEGs could be used to take the step from the genetic engineering of individuals to the genetic engineering of populations.",

Such peptides can have excellent pharmaceutical properties, combining the stability and tissue penetration of small-molecule drugs with the specificity of much larger protein therapeutics. The ability to design constrained peptides with precisely specified tertiary structures would enable the design of shape-complementary inhibitors of arbitrary targets. Here we describe the development of computational methods for accurate de novo design of conformationally restricted peptides, and the use of these methods to design 18-47 residue, disulfide-crosslinked peptides, a subset of which are heterochiral and/or N-C backbone-cyclized. Both genetically encodable and non-canonical peptides are exceptionally stable to thermal and chemical denaturation, and 12 experimentally determined X-ray and NMR structures are nearly identical to the computational design models. The computational design methods and stable scaffolds presented here provide the basis for development of a new generation of peptide-based drugs.",

        "title": "Modeling structurally variable regions in homologous proteins with rosetta",
        "abstract": "A major limitation of current comparative modeling methods is the accuracy with which regions that are structurally divergent from homologues of known structure can be modeled. Because structural differences between homologous proteins are responsible for variations in protein function and specificity, the ability to model these differences has important functional consequences. Although existing methods can provide reasonably accurate models of short loop regions, modeling longer structurally divergent regions is an unsolved problem. Here we describe a method based on the de novo structure prediction algorithm, Rosetta, for predicting conformations of structurally divergent regions in comparative models. Initial conformations for short segments are selected from the protein structure database, whereas longer segments are built up by using three- and nine-residue fragments drawn from the database and combined by using the Rosetta algorithm. A gap closure term in the potential in combination with modified Newton's method for gradient descent minimization is used to ensure continuity of the peptide backbone. Conformations of variable regions are refined in the context of a fixed template structure using Monte Carlo minimization together with rapid repacking of side-chains to iteratively optimize backbone torsion angles and side-chain rotamers. For short loops, mean accuracies of 0.69, 1.45, and 3.62 A are obtained for 4, 8, and 12 residue loops, respectively. In addition, the method can provide reasonable models of conformations of longer protein segments: predicted conformations of 3A root-mean-square deviation or better were obtained for 5 of 10 examples of segments ranging from 13 to 34 residues. In combination with a sequence alignment algorithm, this method generates complete, ungapped models of protein structures, including regions both similar to and divergent from a homologous structure. This combined method was used to make predictions for 28 protein domains in the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure 4 (CASP 4) and 59 domains in CASP 5, where the method ranked highly among comparative modeling and fold recognition methods. Model accuracy in these blind predictions is dominated by alignment quality, but in the context of accurate alignments, long protein segments can be accurately modeled. Notably, the method correctly predicted the local structure of a 39-residue insertion into a TIM barrel in CASP 5 target T0186.",

The I state is stable for weeks at physiological pH in the absence of denaturant, but rapidly folds to the active, native state on addition of the pro region as a separate polypeptide chain. The mechanism of action of the pro region is distinct from that of the chaperonins: rather than reducing the rate of off-pathway reactions, the pro region accelerates the rate-limiting step on the folding pathway by more than 10(7). Because both the I and native states are stable under identical conditions with no detectable interconversion, the folding of alpha-lytic protease must be under kinetic and not thermodynamic control.",

This systematic review of empirical studies (n = 30) adds to existing research in this field by examining current quantitative studies focused on the relationship between online social networking and symptoms of depression. The academic databases PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched systematically using terms related to online social networking and depression.

The needle filament forms a hollow tube with a channel ~20 Å in diameter that serves as a conduit for proteins secreted into the targeted host cell. In the past ten years, technical breakthroughs in biophysical techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and solid-state NMR (SSNMR) spectroscopy have uncovered atomic resolution details about the T3SS needle assembly. Several high-resolution structures of Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri T3SS needles have been reported demonstrating a common structural fold. These structural models have been used to explain the active role of the needle in transmitting the host-cell contact signal from the tip to the base of the T3SS through conformational changes as well as during the injection of effector proteins. In this chapter, we summarize the current knowledge about the structure and the role of the T3SS needle during T3SS assembly and effector secretion.",

A fine-grained representation can approximate the actual structure more accurately, but may require many more degrees of freedom than a coarse-grained representation and hence make conformational search more challenging. We investigate this tradeoff between the accuracy and the size of protein conformational search space for two frequently used representations: one with fixed bond angles and lengths and one that has full flexibility. We performed large-scale explorations of the energy landscapes of 82 protein domains under each model, and find that the introduction of bond angle flexibility significantly increases the average energy gap between native and non-native structures. We also find that incorporating bonded geometry flexibility improves low resolution X-ray crystallographic refinement. These results suggest that backbone bond angle relaxation makes an important contribution to native structure energetics, that current energy functions are sufficiently accurate to capture the energetic gain associated with subtle deformations from chain ideality, and more speculatively, that backbone geometry distortions occur late in protein folding to optimize packing in the native state.",

The optimal embedding is determined by maximizing the exposure of surface hydrophobic residues within the membrane and minimizing hydrophobic exposure outside of the membrane. Protein conformations are built up using the Rosetta fragment assembly method and evaluated using a new membrane-specific version of the Rosetta low-resolution energy function in which residue-residue and residue-environment interactions are functions of the membrane layer in addition to amino acid identity, distance, and density. We find that lower energy and more native-like structures are achieved by sequential addition of helices to a growing chain, which may mimic some aspects of helical protein biogenesis after translocation, rather than folding the whole chain simultaneously as in the Rosetta soluble protein prediction method.

Although high-resolution structures have not yet been determined, eight of these proteins appear to be folded and their circular dichroism spectra are similar to those of their wild-type counterparts. Six of the proteins have stabilities equal to or up to 7kcal/mol greater than their wild-type counterparts, and four of the proteins have NMR spectra consistent with a well-packed, rigid structure.

The formolase pathway is predicted to use carbon more efficiently and with less backward flux than any naturally occurring one-carbon assimilation pathway. When supplemented with enzymes carrying out the other steps in the pathway, FLS converts formate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and other central metabolites in vitro.

Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into >100 µm three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein-protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable.

In applications to models produced using nuclear magnetic resonance data and to comparative models based on distant structural homologues, the method can significantly improve the accuracy of the structures in terms of both the backbone conformations and the placement of core side chains. Furthermore, the resulting models satisfy a particularly stringent test: they provide significantly better solutions to the X-ray crystallographic phase problem in molecular replacement trials. Finally, we show that all-atom refinement can produce de novo protein structure predictions that reach the high accuracy required for molecular replacement without any experimental phase information and in the absence of templates suitable for molecular replacement from the Protein Data Bank. These results suggest that the combination of high-resolution structure prediction with state-of-the-art phasing tools may be unexpectedly powerful in phasing crystallographic data for which molecular replacement is hindered by the absence of sufficiently accurate previous models.",

Furthermore, despite the dramatic changes in sequence, the folding rates of the reduced alphabet proteins are very close to that of the naturally occurring SH3 domain. This finding suggests that despite the vast size of the search space, the rapid folding of biological sequences to their native states is not the result of extensive evolutionary optimization.

It has since emerged as a major risk factor (causative gene) for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Detailed understanding of the structural features of the three isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4), which differ by only a single amino acid interchange, has elucidated their unique functions. ApoE2 and apoE4 increase the risk for heart disease: apoE2 increases atherogenic lipoprotein levels (it binds poorly to LDL receptors), and apoE4 increases LDL levels (it binds preferentially to triglyceride-rich, very low density lipoproteins, leading to downregulation of LDL receptors). ApoE4 also increases the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, decreases their age of onset, or alters their progression. ApoE4 likely causes neurodegeneration secondary to its abnormal structure, caused by an interaction between its carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains, called domain interaction. When neurons are stressed or injured, they synthesize apoE to redistribute cholesterol for neuronal repair or remodeling. However, because of its altered structure, neuronal apoE4 undergoes neuron-specific proteolysis, generating neurotoxic fragments (12-29 kDa) that escape the secretory pathway and cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cytoskeletal alterations, including tau phosphorylation. ApoE4-associated pathology can be prevented by small-molecule structure correctors that block domain interaction by converting apoE4 to a molecule that resembles apoE3 both structurally and functionally. Structure correctors are a potential therapeutic approach to reduce apoE4 pathology in both cardiovascular and neurological disorders.",

Crystallography provides a high-resolution description of protein structure in the crystal environment, while NMR describes structure in solution but using less data. NMR structures display more variability, but is this because crystal contacts are absent or because of fewer data constraints? Here we report unexpected insight into this issue obtained through analysis of detailed protein energy landscapes generated by large-scale, native-enhanced sampling of conformational space with Rosetta@home for 111 protein domains. In the absence of tightly associating binding partners or ligands, the lowest-energy Rosetta models were nearly all <2.5 Å C(α)RMSD from the experimental structure; this result demonstrates that structure prediction accuracy for globular proteins is limited mainly by the ability to sample close to the native structure. While the lowest-energy models are similar to deposited structures, they are not identical; the largest deviations are most often in regions involved in ligand, quaternary, or crystal contacts. For ligand binding proteins, the low energy models may resemble the apo structures, and for oligomeric proteins, the monomeric assembly intermediates. The deviations between the low energy models and crystal structures largely disappear when landscapes are computed in the context of the crystal lattice or multimer. The computed low-energy ensembles, with tight crystal-structure-like packing in the core, but more NMR-structure-like variability in loops, may in some cases resemble the native state ensembles of proteins better than individual crystal or NMR structures, and can suggest experimentally testable hypotheses relating alternative states and structural heterogeneity to function.",

For domains matched to a homolog with an experimentally characterized structure by PSI-BLAST or Pcons2, Robetta uses a new alignment method, called K*Sync, to align the query sequence onto the parent structure. It then models the variable regions by allowing them to explore conformational space with fragments in fashion similar to the de novo protocol, but in the context of the template. When no structural homolog is available, domains are modeled with the Rosetta de novo protocol, which allows the full length of the domain to explore conformational space via fragment-insertion, producing a large decoy ensemble from which the final models are selected. The Robetta server produced quite reasonable predictions for targets in the recent CASP-5 and CAFASP-3 experiments, some of which were at the level of the best human predictions.",

L100I, K101E, K101Q, Y188H, Y188L, G190S, G190A, and G190E mutations were also observed. V106A, Y181C, and Y188C mutations, which have been associated with high levels of resistance to other NNRTIs, were rare in the patient samples in this study, both before and after exposure to efavirenz. The spectrum of mutations observed in cases of virological treatment failure was similar for patients initially dosed with efavirenz at 200, 400, or 600 mg once a day and for patients treated with efavirenz in combination with indinavir, stavudine, or ZDV-3TC. The proportion of patients carrying NNRTI resistance mutations, usually K103N, increased dramatically at the time of initial viral load rebound in cases of treatment failure after exposure to efavirenz. Viruses with multiple, linked NNRTI mutations, especially K103N-V108I and K103N-P225H double mutants, accumulated more slowly following the emergence of K103N mutant viruses.",

        "abstract": "Although conflict, war, violence, and terrorism affect tourism, research that identifies possible channels of these effects is scarce. We explore if the adverse effects are channelled through proximity to conflict areas. We use the conflict in Kosovo in 1999 and the country Croatia as a quasi-natural experiment and take advantage of the specific north-west to south-east orientation of Croatian Adriatic counties to identify the effect of NATO bombing in Kosovo on tourism outcomes as well as the potential proximity channel. Using data on the population of Croatian firms and the difference-in-differences identification strategy we find that tourism companies' revenues decreased significantly due to NATO bombing, especially in accommodation services and in companies with 50 or more employees. However, using a synthetic control approach we find that the adverse effect is only transitory. Analysing heterogeneous effects with respect to the distance of the firm from Kosovo-using a linear and a more flexible model-we find compelling evidence that within-country proximity to conflict is not a significant channel through which the negative effect propagates.",

The resulting enzyme, E-DreI (Engineered I-DmoI/I-CreI), binds a long chimeric DNA target site with nanomolar affinity, cleaving it precisely at a rate equivalent to its natural parents.

Simple parametric models have been used to design a wide range of α-helical coiled-coil structures, but to date there has been no success with β-barrels. Here we show that accurate de novo design of β-barrels requires considerable symmetry-breaking to achieve continuous hydrogen-bond connectivity and eliminate backbone strain. We then build ensembles of β-barrel backbone models with cavity shapes that match the fluorogenic compound DFHBI, and use a hierarchical grid-based search method to simultaneously optimize the rigid-body placement of DFHBI in these cavities and the identities of the surrounding amino acids to achieve high shape and chemical complementarity. The designs have high structural accuracy and bind and fluorescently activate DFHBI in vitro and in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells. This de novo design of small-molecule binding activity, using backbones custom-built to bind the ligand, should enable the design of increasingly sophisticated ligand-binding proteins, sensors and catalysts that are not limited by the backbone geometries available in known protein structures.",

In this report, we describe a strategy for predicting protein structure based on the working hypothesis that there are a greater number of low-energy conformations surrounding the correct fold than there are surrounding low-energy incorrect folds. To test this idea, 12 ensembles of 500 to 1,000 low-energy structures for 10 small proteins were analyzed by calculating the rms deviation of the Calpha coordinates between each conformation and every other conformation in the ensemble. In all 12 cases, the conformation with the greatest number of conformations within 4-A rms deviation was closer to the native structure than were the majority of conformations in the ensemble, and in most cases it was among the closest 1 to 5%. These results suggest that, to fold efficiently and retain robustness to changes in amino acid sequence, proteins may have evolved a native structure situated within a broad basin of low-energy conformations, a feature which could facilitate the prediction of protein structure at low resolution.",

We present here kinetics of hole transfer, characterization of the intermediates involved in the hole oxidation of sulfide ion, and the back electron transfer between sulfide radical and electrons injected into TiO(2) nanoparticles. The kinetic rate constant (10(7)-10(9) s(-1)) for the hole transfer obtained from the emission lifetime measurements suggests slow hole scavenging from CdSe by S(2-) is one of the limiting factors in attaining high overall efficiency.

The 19 mammalian Wnt proteins are cross-reactive with the 10 FZD receptors, and this has complicated the attribution of distinct biological functions to specific FZD and Wnt subtype interactions. Furthermore, Wnt proteins are modified post-translationally by palmitoylation, which is essential for their secretion, function and interaction with FZD receptors. As a result of their acylation, Wnt proteins are very hydrophobic and require detergents for purification, which presents major obstacles to the preparation and application of recombinant Wnt proteins. This hydrophobicity has hindered the determination of the molecular mechanisms of Wnt signalling activation and the functional importance of FZD subtypes, and the use of Wnt proteins as therapeutic agents. Here we develop surrogate Wnt agonists, water-soluble FZD-LRP5/LRP6 heterodimerizers, with FZD5/FZD8-specific and broadly FZD-reactive binding domains. Similar to WNT3A, these Wnt agonists elicit a characteristic β-catenin signalling response in a FZD-selective fashion, enhance the osteogenic lineage commitment of primary mouse and human mesenchymal stem cells, and support the growth of a broad range of primary human organoid cultures. In addition, the surrogates can be systemically expressed and exhibit Wnt activity in vivo in the mouse liver, regulating metabolic liver zonation and promoting hepatocyte proliferation, resulting in hepatomegaly. These surrogates demonstrate that canonical Wnt signalling can be activated by bi-specific ligands that induce receptor heterodimerization. Furthermore, these easily produced, non-lipidated Wnt surrogate agonists facilitate functional studies of Wnt signalling and the exploration of Wnt agonists for translational applications in regenerative medicine.",

        "abstract": "Metformin, a biguanide derivate, has pleiotropic effects beyond glucose reduction, including improvement of lipid profiles and lowering microvascular and macrovascular complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These effects have been ascribed to adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in the liver and skeletal muscle. However, metformin effects are not attenuated when AMPK is knocked out and intravenous metformin is less effective than oral medication, raising the possibility of important gut pharmacology. We hypothesized that the pharmacology of metformin includes alteration of bile acid recirculation and gut microbiota resulting in enhanced enteroendocrine hormone secretion. In this study we evaluated T2DM subjects on and off metformin monotherapy to characterize the gut-based mechanisms of metformin. Subjects were studied at 4 time points: (i) at baseline on metformin, (ii) 7 days after stopping metformin, (iii) when fasting blood glucose (FBG) had risen by 25% after stopping metformin, and (iv) when FBG returned to baseline levels after restarting the metformin. At these timepoints we profiled glucose, insulin, gut hormones (glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and bile acids in blood, as well as duodenal and faecal bile acids and gut microbiota. We found that metformin withdrawal was associated with a reduction of active and total GLP-1 and elevation of serum bile acids, especially cholic acid and its conjugates. These effects reversed when metformin was restarted. Effects on circulating PYY were more modest, while GIP changes were negligible. Microbiota abundance of the phylum Firmicutes was positively correlated with changes in cholic acid and conjugates, while Bacteroidetes abundance was negatively correlated. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes representation were also correlated with levels of serum PYY. Our study suggests that metformin has complex effects due to gut-based pharmacology which might provide insights into novel therapeutic approaches to treat T2DM and associated metabolic diseases.",

Here we demonstrate the elicitation of structure-specific antibodies against the HIV-1 gp41 epitope of the broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5. This conformationally flexible region of gp41 assumes mostly helical conformations but adopts a kinked, extended structure when bound by antibody 2F5. Computational techniques were employed to transplant the 2F5 epitope into select acceptor scaffolds. The resultant \"2F5-epitope scaffolds\" possessed nanomolar affinity for antibody 2F5 and a range of epitope flexibilities and antigenic specificities. Crystallographic characterization of the epitope scaffold with highest affinity and antigenic discrimination confirmed good to near perfect attainment of the target conformation for the gp41 molecular graft in free and 2F5-bound states, respectively. Animals immunized with 2F5-epitope scaffolds showed levels of graft-specific immune responses that correlated with graft flexibility (p < 0.04), while antibody responses against the graft-as dissected residue-by-residue with alanine substitutions-resembled more closely those of 2F5 than sera elicited with flexible or cyclized peptides, a resemblance heightened by heterologous prime-boost. Lastly, crystal structures of a gp41 peptide in complex with monoclonal antibodies elicited by the 2F5-epitope scaffolds revealed that the elicited antibodies induce gp41 to assume its 2F5-recognized shape. Epitope scaffolds thus provide a means to elicit antibodies that recognize a predetermined target shape and sequence, even if that shape is transient in nature, and a means by which to dissect factors influencing such elicitation.",

The resulting enzyme catalyses a reversible aldol reaction with high stereoselectivity and tolerates a broad range of substrates. Biochemical and structural studies show that catalysis depends on a Lys-Tyr-Asn-Tyr tetrad that emerged adjacent to a computationally designed hydrophobic pocket during directed evolution. This constellation of residues is poised to activate the substrate by Schiff base formation, promote mechanistically important proton transfers and stabilize multiple transition states along a complex reaction coordinate. The emergence of such a sophisticated catalytic centre shows that there is nothing magical about the catalytic activities or mechanisms of naturally occurring enzymes, or the evolutionary process that gave rise to them.",

We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach through the de novo design of binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with different shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization shows that the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino acids, are hyperstable and, following experimental optimization, bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities.

Necroptosis occurs downstream of the receptor-interacting protein kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3, whose activation leads to lytic cell death accompanied by de novo production of proinflammatory mediators. Here, we show that ectopic introduction of necroptotic cells to the tumor microenvironment promotes BATF3+ cDC1- and CD8+ leukocyte-dependent antitumor immunity accompanied by increased tumor antigen loading by tumor-associated antigen-presenting cells. Furthermore, we report the development of constitutively active forms of the necroptosis-inducing enzyme RIPK3 and show that delivery of a gene encoding this enzyme to tumor cells using adeno-associated viruses induces tumor cell necroptosis, which synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade to promote durable tumor clearance. These findings support a role for RIPK1/RIPK3 activation as a beneficial proximal target in the initiation of tumor immunity. Considering that successful tumor immunotherapy regimens will require the rational application of multiple treatment modalities, we propose that maximizing the immunogenicity of dying cells within the tumor microenvironment through specific activation of the necroptotic pathway represents a beneficial treatment approach that may warrant further clinical development.",

        "abstract": "Evolutionary advances are often fueled by unanticipated innovation. Directed evolution of a computationally designed enzyme suggests that pronounced molecular changes can also drive the optimization of primitive protein active sites. The specific activity of an artificial retro-aldolase was boosted >4,400-fold by random mutagenesis and screening, affording catalytic efficiencies approaching those of natural enzymes. However, structural and mechanistic studies reveal that the engineered catalytic apparatus, consisting of a reactive lysine and an ordered water molecule, was unexpectedly abandoned in favor of a new lysine residue in a substrate-binding pocket created during the optimization process. Structures of the initial in silico design, a mechanistically promiscuous intermediate and one of the most evolved variants highlight the importance of loop mobility and supporting functional groups in the emergence of the new catalytic center. Such internal competition between alternative reactive sites may have characterized the early evolution of many natural enzymes.",

        "abstract": "Efavirenz (also known as DMP 266 or SUSTIVA) is a potent nonnucleoside inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and of HIV-1 replication in vitro and in vivo. Most patients on efavirenz-containing regimens have sustained antiviral responses; however, rebounds in plasma viral load have been observed in some patients in association with the emergence of mutant strains of HIV-1. Virus isolates from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with such treatment failures, as well as recombinant viruses incorporating viral sequences derived from patient plasma, show reduced in vitro susceptibility to efavirenz in association with mutations in the RT gene encoding K103N, Y188L, or G190S/E substitutions. Patterns of RT gene mutations and in vitro susceptibility were similar in plasma virus and in viruses isolated from PBMCs. Variant strains of HIV-1 constructed by site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the role of K103N, G190S, and Y188L substitutions in reduced susceptibility to efavirenz. Further, certain secondary mutations (V106I, V108I, Y181C, Y188H, P225H, and F227L) conferred little resistance to efavirenz as single mutations but enhanced the level of resistance of viruses carrying these mutations in combination with K103N or Y188L. Viruses with K103N or Y188L mutations, regardless of the initial selecting nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), exhibited cross-resistance to all of the presently available NNRTIs (efavirenz, nevirapine, and delavirdine). Some virus isolates from nevirapine or delavirdine treatment failures that lacked K103N or Y188L mutations remained susceptible to efavirenz in vitro, although the clinical significance of this finding is presently unclear.",

        "abstract": "Hydrogen bonding is a key contributor to the exquisite specificity of the interactions within and between biological macromolecules, and hence accurate modeling of such interactions requires an accurate description of hydrogen bonding energetics. Here we investigate the orientation and distance dependence of hydrogen bonding energetics by combining two quite disparate but complementary approaches: quantum mechanical electronic structure calculations and protein structural analysis. We find a remarkable agreement between the energy landscapes obtained from the electronic structure calculations and the distributions of hydrogen bond geometries observed in protein structures. In contrast, molecular mechanics force fields commonly used for biomolecular simulations do not consistently exhibit close correspondence to either quantum mechanical calculations or experimentally observed hydrogen bonding geometries. These results suggest a route to improved energy functions for biological macromolecules that combines the generality of quantum mechanical electronic structure calculations with the accurate context dependence implicit in protein structural analysis.",

The second approach, \"inpainting,\" starts from the functional site and fills in additional sequence and structure to create a viable protein scaffold in a single forward pass through a specifically trained RoseTTAFold network. We use these two methods to design candidate immunogens, receptor traps, metalloproteins, enzymes, and protein-binding proteins and validate the designs using a combination of in silico and experimental tests.",

        "abstract": "Proteins are inherently plastic molecules, whose function often critically depends on excursions between different molecular conformations (conformers). However, a rigorous understanding of the relation between a protein's structure, dynamics and function remains elusive. This is because many of the conformers on its energy landscape are only transiently formed and marginally populated (less than a few per cent of the total number of molecules), so that they cannot be individually characterized by most biophysical tools. Here we study a lysozyme mutant from phage T4 that binds hydrophobic molecules and populates an excited state transiently (about 1 ms) to about 3% at 25 °C (ref. 5). We show that such binding occurs only via the ground state, and present the atomic-level model of the 'invisible', excited state obtained using a combined strategy of relaxation-dispersion NMR (ref. 6) and CS-Rosetta model building that rationalizes this observation. The model was tested using structure-based design calculations identifying point mutants predicted to stabilize the excited state relative to the ground state. In this way a pair of mutations were introduced, inverting the relative populations of the ground and excited states and altering function. Our results suggest a mechanism for the evolution of a protein's function by changing the delicate balance between the states on its energy landscape. More generally, they show that our approach can generate and validate models of excited protein states.",

        "abstract": "A central question in protein evolution is the extent to which naturally occurring proteins sample the space of folded structures accessible to the polypeptide chain. Repeat proteins composed of multiple tandem copies of a modular structure unit are widespread in nature and have critical roles in molecular recognition, signalling, and other essential biological processes. Naturally occurring repeat proteins have been re-engineered for molecular recognition and modular scaffolding applications. Here we use computational protein design to investigate the space of folded structures that can be generated by tandem repeating a simple helix-loop-helix-loop structural motif. Eighty-three designs with sequences unrelated to known repeat proteins were experimentally characterized. Of these, 53 are monomeric and stable at 95 °C, and 43 have solution X-ray scattering spectra consistent with the design models. Crystal structures of 15 designs spanning a broad range of curvatures are in close agreement with the design models with root mean square deviations ranging from 0.7 to 2.5 Å. Our results show that existing repeat proteins occupy only a small fraction of the possible repeat protein sequence and structure space and that it is possible to design novel repeat proteins with precisely specified geometries, opening up a wide array of new possibilities for biomolecular engineering.",

        "abstract": "Conventional protein structure determination from nuclear magnetic resonance data relies heavily on side-chain proton-to-proton distances. The necessary side-chain resonance assignment, however, is labor intensive and prone to error. Here we show that structures can be accurately determined without nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) information on the side chains for proteins up to 25 kilodaltons by incorporating backbone chemical shifts, residual dipolar couplings, and amide proton distances into the Rosetta protein structure modeling methodology. These data, which are too sparse for conventional methods, serve only to guide conformational search toward the lowest-energy conformations in the folding landscape; the details of the computed models are determined by the physical chemistry implicit in the Rosetta all-atom energy function. The new method is not hindered by the deuteration required to suppress nuclear relaxation processes for proteins greater than 15 kilodaltons and should enable routine NMR structure determination for larger proteins.",

Consistent structure generation from NMR chemical shift data has recently become feasible for proteins with sizes of up to 130 residues, and such structures are of a quality comparable to those obtained with the standard NMR protocol. This study investigates the influence of the completeness of chemical shift assignments on structures generated from chemical shifts. The Chemical-Shift-Rosetta (CS-Rosetta) protocol was used for de novo protein structure generation with various degrees of completeness of the chemical shift assignment, simulated by omission of entries in the experimental chemical shift data previously used for the initial demonstration of the CS-Rosetta approach. In addition, a new CS-Rosetta protocol is described that improves robustness of the method for proteins with missing or erroneous NMR chemical shift input data. This strategy, which uses traditional Rosetta for pre-filtering of the fragment selection process, is demonstrated for two paramagnetic proteins and also for two proteins with solid-state NMR chemical shift assignments.",

However, the molecular determinants of such interactions have been challenging to understand, even as genomic, proteomic and structural data increase. This knowledge gap has been a major obstacle for the comprehensive understanding of cellular protein-protein interaction networks and for the de novo design of protein binders that are crucial for synthetic biology and translational applications2-9. Here we use a geometric deep-learning framework operating on protein surfaces that generates fingerprints to describe geometric and chemical features that are critical to drive protein-protein interactions10. We hypothesized that these fingerprints capture the key aspects of molecular recognition that represent a new paradigm in the computational design of novel protein interactions. As a proof of principle, we computationally designed several de novo protein binders to engage four protein targets: SARS-CoV-2 spike, PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4. Several designs were experimentally optimized, whereas others were generated purely in silico, reaching nanomolar affinity with structural and mutational characterization showing highly accurate predictions. Overall, our surface-centric approach captures the physical and chemical determinants of molecular recognition, enabling an approach for the de novo design of protein interactions and, more broadly, of artificial proteins with function.",

        "abstract": "Computational design of protein function involves a search for amino acids with the lowest energy subject to a set of constraints specifying function. In many cases a set of natural protein backbone structures, or \"scaffolds\", are searched to find regions where functional sites (an enzyme active site, ligand binding pocket, protein-protein interaction region, etc.) can be placed, and the identities of the surrounding amino acids are optimized to satisfy functional constraints. Input native protein structures almost invariably have regions that score very poorly with the design force field, and any design based on these unmodified structures may result in mutations away from the native sequence solely as a result of the energetic strain. Because the input structure is already a stable protein, it is desirable to keep the total number of mutations to a minimum and to avoid mutations resulting from poorly-scoring input structures. Here we describe a protocol using cycles of minimization with combined backbone/sidechain restraints that is Pareto-optimal with respect to RMSD to the native structure and energetic strain reduction. The protocol should be broadly useful in the preparation of scaffold libraries for functional site design.",

Mutations in voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 are responsible for a number of severe inherited pain syndromes, including inherited erythromelalgia (IEM). Here, we describe the negative shifts in the voltage dependence of activation in the bacterial sodium channel NaVAb as a result of the incorporation of four different IEM mutations in the voltage sensor, which recapitulate the gain-of-function effects observed with these mutations in human NaV1.7. Crystal structures of NaVAb with these IEM mutations revealed that a mutation in the S1 segment of the voltage sensor facilitated the outward movement of S4 gating charges by widening the pathway for gating charge translocation. In contrast, mutations in the S4 segments modified hydrophobic interactions with surrounding amino acid side chains or membrane phospholipids that would enhance the outward movement of the gating charges. These results provide key structural insights into the mechanisms by which these IEM mutations in the voltage sensors can facilitate outward movements of the gating charges in the S4 segment and cause hyperexcitability and severe pain in IEM. Our work gives new insights into IEM pathogenesis at the near-atomic level and provides a molecular model for mutation-specific therapy of this debilitating disease.",

        "abstract": "The 62 residue IgG binding domain of protein L consists of a central alpha-helix packed on a four-stranded beta-sheet formed by N and C-terminal beta-hairpins. The overall topology of the protein is quite symmetric: the beta-hairpins have similar lengths and make very similar interactions with the central helix. Characterization of the effects of 70 point mutations distributed throughout the protein on the kinetics of folding and unfolding reveals that this symmetry is completely broken during folding; the first beta-hairpin is largely structured while the second beta-hairpin and helix are largely disrupted in the folding transition state ensemble. The results are not consistent with a \"hydrophobic core first\" picture of protein folding; the first beta-hairpin appears to be at least as ordered at the rate limiting step in folding as the hydrophobic core.",

Here, we demonstrate that computational design of a library with chemically diverse stabilizing mutations allows the engineering of drastically stabilized and fully functional variants of the mesostable enzyme limonene epoxide hydrolase. First, point mutations were selected if they significantly improved the predicted free energy of protein folding. Disulfide bonds were designed using sampling of backbone conformational space, which tripled the number of experimentally stabilizing disulfide bridges. Next, orthogonal in silico screening steps were used to remove chemically unreasonable mutations and mutations that are predicted to increase protein flexibility. The resulting library of 64 variants was experimentally screened, which revealed 21 (pairs of) stabilizing mutations located both in relatively rigid and in flexible areas of the enzyme. Finally, combining 10-12 of these confirmed mutations resulted in multi-site mutants with an increase in apparent melting temperature from 50 to 85°C, enhanced catalytic activity, preserved regioselectivity and a >250-fold longer half-life. The developed Framework for Rapid Enzyme Stabilization by Computational libraries (FRESCO) requires far less screening than conventional directed evolution.",

Here we describe the computational design of four-fold symmetrical (β/α)8 barrels guided by geometrical and chemical principles. Experimental characterization of 33 designs revealed the importance of side chain-backbone hydrogen bonds for defining the strand register between repeat units. The X-ray crystal structure of a designed thermostable 184-residue protein is nearly identical to that of the designed TIM-barrel model. PSI-BLAST searches do not identify sequence similarities to known TIM-barrel proteins, and sensitive profile-profile searches indicate that the design sequence is distant from other naturally occurring TIM-barrel superfamilies, suggesting that Nature has sampled only a subset of the sequence space available to the TIM-barrel fold. The ability to design TIM barrels de novo opens new possibilities for custom-made enzymes.",

        "abstract": "The malaria parasite replicates within an intraerythrocytic parasitophorous vacuole (PV). Eventually, in a tightly regulated process called egress, proteins of the PV and intracellular merozoite surface are modified by an essential parasite serine protease called PfSUB1, whilst the enclosing PV and erythrocyte membranes rupture, releasing merozoites to invade fresh erythrocytes. Inhibition of the Plasmodium falciparum cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PfPKG) prevents egress, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we show that PfPKG activity is required for PfSUB1 discharge into the PV, as well as for release of distinct merozoite organelles called micronemes. Stimulation of PfPKG by inhibiting parasite phosphodiesterase activity induces premature PfSUB1 discharge and egress of developmentally immature, non-invasive parasites. Our findings identify the signalling pathway that regulates PfSUB1 function and egress, and raise the possibility of targeting PfPKG or parasite phosphodiesterases in therapeutic approaches to dysregulate critical protease-mediated steps in the parasite life cycle.",

        "abstract": "Cocaine produces a persistent reduction in cystine-glutamate exchange via system x(c)- in the nucleus accumbens that may contribute to pathological glutamate signaling linked to addiction. System x(c)- influences glutamate neurotransmission by maintaining basal, extracellular glutamate in the nucleus accumbens, which, in turn, shapes synaptic activity by stimulating group II metabotropic glutamate autoreceptors. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that a long-term reduction in system x(c)- activity is part of the plasticity produced by repeated cocaine that results in the establishment of compulsive drug seeking. To test this, the cysteine prodrug N-acetylcysteine was administered before daily cocaine to determine the impact of increased cystine-glutamate exchange on the development of plasticity-dependent cocaine seeking. Although N-acetylcysteine administered before cocaine did not alter the acute effects of cocaine on self-administration or locomotor activity, it prevented behaviors produced by repeated cocaine including escalation of drug intake, behavioral sensitization, and cocaine-primed reinstatement. Because sensitization or reinstatement was not evident even 2-3 weeks after the last injection of N-acetylcysteine, we examined whether N-acetylcysteine administered before daily cocaine also prevented the persistent reduction in system x(c)- activity produced by repeated cocaine. Interestingly, N-acetylcysteine pretreatment prevented cocaine-induced changes in [35S]cystine transport via system x(c)-, basal glutamate, and cocaine-evoked glutamate in the nucleus accumbens when assessed at least 3 weeks after the last N-acetylcysteine pretreatment. These findings indicate that N-acetylcysteine selectively alters plasticity-dependent behaviors and that normal system x(c)- activity prevents pathological changes in extracellular glutamate that may be necessary for compulsive drug seeking.",

Most current methods either leave side chains fixed in the conformations observed in the unbound protein structures or allow the side chains to sample a set of discrete rotamer conformations. Here we describe a rapid and efficient method for sampling off-rotamer side-chain conformations by torsion space minimization during protein-protein docking starting from discrete rotamer libraries supplemented with side-chain conformations taken from the unbound structures, and show that the new method improves side-chain modeling and increases the energetic discrimination between good and bad models. Analysis of the distribution of side-chain interaction energies within and between the two protein partners shows that the new method leads to more native-like distributions of interaction energies and that the neglect of side-chain entropy produces a small but measurable increase in the number of residues whose interaction energy cannot compensate for the entropic cost of side-chain freezing at the interface. The power of the method is highlighted by a number of predictions of unprecedented accuracy in the recent CAPRI (Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions) blind test of protein-protein docking methods.",

Template-based modeling predictions using an iterative refinement algorithm improved over the best existing templates for the majority of proteins with less than 200 residues. Free modeling methods gave near-atomic accuracy predictions for several targets under 100 residues from all secondary structure classes.

We design a static, five-helix 'cage' with a single interface that can interact either intramolecularly with a terminal 'latch' helix or intermolecularly with a peptide 'key'. Encoded on the latch are functional motifs for binding, degradation or nuclear export that function only when the key displaces the latch from the cage. We describe orthogonal cage-key systems that function in vitro, in yeast and in mammalian cells with up to 40-fold activation of function by key. The ability to design switchable protein functions that are controlled by induced conformational change is a milestone for de novo protein design, and opens up new avenues for synthetic biology and cell engineering.",

Reverse dialysis of the group I agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) into the nucleus accumbens resulted in an increase in extracellular glutamate levels that was mediated by the mGluR1 subtype and depended on voltage-dependent Na+ and Ca2+conductance. At 3 weeks after discontinuing 1 week of daily cocaine injections, the capacity of DHPG to induce glutamate release was markedly reduced. Similarly, DHPG induced an mGluR1-dependent increase in locomotor activity after microinjection into the nucleus accumbens that was significantly blunted 3 weeks after repeated cocaine administration. Signaling through group I mGluRs is regulated, in part, by Homer proteins, and it was found that the blunting of group I mGluR-induced glutamate release and motor activity after repeated cocaine was associated with a reduction in Homer1b/c protein that was selective for the medial nucleus accumbens. These data show that repeated cocaine produces an enduring inhibition of the neurochemical and behavioral consequences of stimulating mGluR1 that is accompanied by changes in the mGluR scaffolding apparatus.",

        "title": "Evaluation of structural and evolutionary contributions to deleterious mutation prediction",
        "abstract": "Methods for automated prediction of deleterious protein mutations have utilized both structural and evolutionary information but the relative contribution of these two factors remains unclear. To address this, we have used a variety of structural and evolutionary features to create simple deleterious mutation models that have been tested on both experimental mutagenesis and human allele data. We find that the most accurate predictions are obtained using a solvent-accessibility term, the C(beta) density, and a score derived from homologous sequences, SIFT. A classification tree using these two features has a cross-validated prediction error of 20.5% on an experimental mutagenesis test set when the prior probability for deleterious and neutral cases is equal, whereas this prediction error is 28.8% and 22.2% using either the C(beta) density or SIFT alone. The improvement imparted by structure increases when fewer homologs are available: when restricted to three homologs the prediction error improves from 26.9% using SIFT alone to 22.4% using SIFT and the C(beta) density, or 24.8% using SIFT and a noisy C(beta) density term approximating the inaccuracy of ab initio structures modeled by the Rosetta method. We conclude that methods for deleterious mutation prediction should include structural information when fewer than five to ten homologs are available, and that ab initio predicted structures may soon be useful in such cases when high-resolution structures are unavailable.",

        "abstract": "The prediction and design at the atomic level of membrane protein structures and interactions is a critical but unsolved challenge. To address this problem, we have developed an all-atom physical model that describes intraprotein and protein-solvent interactions in the membrane environment. We evaluated the ability of the model to recapitulate the energetics and structural specificities of polytopic membrane proteins by using a battery of in silico prediction and design tests. First, in side-chain packing and design tests, the model successfully predicts the side-chain conformations at 73% of nonexposed positions and the native amino acid identities at 34% of positions in naturally occurring membrane proteins. Second, the model predicts significant energy gaps between native and nonnative structures of transmembrane helical interfaces and polytopic membrane proteins. Third, distortions in transmembrane helices are successfully recapitulated in docking experiments by using fragments of ideal helices judiciously defined around helical kinks. Finally, de novo structure prediction reaches near-atomic accuracy (<2.5 A) for several small membrane protein domains (<150 residues). The success of the model highlights the critical role of van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interactions in the stability and structural specificity of membrane protein structures and sets the stage for the high-resolution prediction and design of complex membrane protein architectures.",

        "abstract": "Voltage-gated ion channels control generation and propagation of action potentials in excitable cells. Significant progress has been made in understanding structure and function of the voltage-gated ion channels, highlighted by the high-resolution open-state structure of the voltage-gated potassium channel, K(v)1.2. However, because the structure of the closed state is unknown, the gating mechanism remains controversial. We adapted the rosetta membrane method to model the structures of the K(v)1.2 and KvAP channels using homology, de novo, and domain assembly methods and selected the most plausible models using a limited number of experimental constraints. Our model of K(v)1.2 in the open state is very similar in overall topology to the x-ray structure of this channel. Modeling of KvAP in the open state suggests that orientation of the voltage-sensing domain relative to the pore-forming domain is considerably different from the orientation in the K(v)1.2 open state and that the magnitude of the vertical movement of S4 is significantly greater. Structural modeling of closed state of K(v)1.2 suggests gating movement that can be viewed as a sum of two previously suggested mechanisms: translation (2-4 A) plus rotation ( approximately 180 degrees ) of the S4 segment as proposed in the original \"sliding helix\" or \"helical screw\" models coupled with a rolling motion of the S1-S3 segments around S4, similar to recent \"transporter\" models of gating. We propose a unified mechanism of voltage-dependent gating for K(v)1.2 and KvAP in which this major conformational change moves the gating charge across the electric field in an analogous way for both channels.",

Alternative splicing of Drosophila Dscam can generate 19,008 distinct extracellular domains containing different combinations of three variable immunoglobulin domains. To test the binding properties of many Dscam isoforms, we developed a high-throughput ELISA-based binding assay. We provide evidence that 95% (>18,000) of Dscam isoforms exhibit striking isoform-specific homophilic binding. We demonstrate that each of the three variable domains binds to the same variable domain in an opposing isoform and identify the structural elements that mediate this self-binding of each domain. These studies demonstrate that self-binding domains can assemble in different combinations to generate an enormous family of homophilic binding proteins. We propose that this vast repertoire of Dscam recognition molecules is sufficient to provide each neuron with a unique identity and homotypic binding specificity, thereby allowing neuronal processes to distinguish between self and nonself.",

        "abstract": "Molecular replacement procedures, which search for placements of a starting model within the crystallographic unit cell that best account for the measured diffraction amplitudes, followed by automatic chain tracing methods, have allowed the rapid solution of large numbers of protein crystal structures. Despite extensive work, molecular replacement or the subsequent rebuilding usually fail with more divergent starting models based on remote homologues with less than 30% sequence identity. Here we show that this limitation can be substantially reduced by combining algorithms for protein structure modelling with those developed for crystallographic structure determination. An approach integrating Rosetta structure modelling with Autobuild chain tracing yielded high-resolution structures for 8 of 13 X-ray diffraction data sets that could not be solved in the laboratories of expert crystallographers and that remained unsolved after application of an extensive array of alternative approaches. We estimate that the new method should allow rapid structure determination without experimental phase information for over half the cases where current methods fail, given diffraction data sets of better than 3.2 Å resolution, four or fewer copies in the asymmetric unit, and the availability of structures of homologous proteins with >20% sequence identity.",

        "abstract": "Computational design is a test of our understanding of enzyme catalysis and a means of engineering novel, tailor-made enzymes. While the de novo computational design of catalytically efficient enzymes remains a challenge, designed enzymes may comprise unique starting points for further optimization by directed evolution. Directed evolution of two computationally designed Kemp eliminases, KE07 and KE70, led to low to moderately efficient enzymes (k(cat)/K(m) values of ≤ 5 10(4) M(-1)s(-1)). Here we describe the optimization of a third design, KE59. Although KE59 was the most catalytically efficient Kemp eliminase from this design series (by k(cat)/K(m), and by catalyzing the elimination of nonactivated benzisoxazoles), its impaired stability prevented its evolutionary optimization. To boost KE59's evolvability, stabilizing consensus mutations were included in the libraries throughout the directed evolution process. The libraries were also screened with less activated substrates. Sixteen rounds of mutation and selection led to > 2,000-fold increase in catalytic efficiency, mainly via higher k(cat) values. The best KE59 variants exhibited k(cat)/K(m) values up to 0.6 10(6) M(-1)s(-1), and k(cat)/k(uncat) values of ≤ 10(7) almost regardless of substrate reactivity. Biochemical, structural, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies provided insights regarding the optimization of KE59. Overall, the directed evolution of three different designed Kemp eliminases, KE07, KE70, and KE59, demonstrates that computational designs are highly evolvable and can be optimized to high catalytic efficiencies.",

To simultaneously model these two types of behavior, we refined an orientation dependent model of hydrogen bonds [Kortemme et al. J. Mol. Biol. 2003, 326, 1239] used by the molecular modeling program Rosetta and then combined it with a distance-dependent Coulomb model of electrostatics. The functional form of the H-bond potential is physically motivated and parameters are fit so that H-bond geometries that Rosetta generates closely resemble H-bond geometries in high-resolution crystal structures. The combined potentials improve performance in a variety of scientific benchmarks including decoy discrimination, side chain prediction, and native sequence recovery in protein design simulations and establishes a new standard energy function for Rosetta.",

Epitope-scaffolds designed for the poorly immunogenic but conserved HIV epitope 4E10 exhibited high epitope structural mimicry, bound with higher affinities to monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4E10 than the cognate peptide, and inhibited HIV neutralization by HIV+ sera. Rabbit immunization with an epitope-scaffold induced antibodies with structural specificity highly similar to mAb 4E10, an important advance toward elicitation of neutralizing activity.

        "abstract": "Rare-cleaving endonucleases have emerged as important tools for making targeted genome modifications. While multiple platforms are now available to generate reagents for research applications, each existing platform has significant limitations in one or more of three key properties necessary for therapeutic application: efficiency of cleavage at the desired target site, specificity of cleavage (i.e. rate of cleavage at 'off-target' sites), and efficient/facile means for delivery to desired target cells. Here, we describe the development of a single-chain rare-cleaving nuclease architecture, which we designate 'megaTAL', in which the DNA binding region of a transcription activator-like (TAL) effector is used to 'address' a site-specific meganuclease adjacent to a single desired genomic target site. This architecture allows the generation of extremely active and hyper-specific compact nucleases that are compatible with all current viral and nonviral cell delivery methods.",

Here we describe a deep-learning-based 'family-wide hallucination' approach that generates large numbers of idealized protein structures containing diverse pocket shapes and designed sequences that encode them. We use these scaffolds to design artificial luciferases that selectively catalyse the oxidative chemiluminescence of the synthetic luciferin substrates diphenylterazine3 and 2-deoxycoelenterazine. The designed active sites position an arginine guanidinium group adjacent to an anion that develops during the reaction in a binding pocket with high shape complementarity. For both luciferin substrates, we obtain designed luciferases with high selectivity; the most active of these is a small (13.9 kDa) and thermostable (with a melting temperature higher than 95 °C) enzyme that has a catalytic efficiency on diphenylterazine (kcat/Km = 106 M-1 s-1) comparable to that of native luciferases, but a much higher substrate specificity. The creation of highly active and specific biocatalysts from scratch with broad applications in biomedicine is a key milestone for computational enzyme design, and our approach should enable generation of a wide range of luciferases and other enzymes.",

We investigate coevolution between 5.4 million pairs of proteins in Escherichia coli and between 3.9 millions pairs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis We find strong coevolution for binary complexes involved in metabolism and weaker coevolution for larger complexes playing roles in genetic information processing. We take advantage of this coevolution, in combination with structure modeling, to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with an accuracy that benchmark studies suggest is considerably higher than that of proteome-wide two-hybrid and mass spectrometry screens. We identify hundreds of previously uncharacterized PPIs in E. coli and M. tuberculosis that both add components to known protein complexes and networks and establish the existence of new ones.",

        "abstract": "We describe predictions of the structures of CASP5 targets using Rosetta. The Rosetta fragment insertion protocol was used to generate models for entire target domains without detectable sequence similarity to a protein of known structure and to build long loop insertions (and N-and C-terminal extensions) in cases where a structural template was available. Encouraging results were obtained both for the de novo predictions and for the long loop insertions; we describe here the successes as well as the failures in the context of current efforts to improve the Rosetta method. In particular, de novo predictions failed for large proteins that were incorrectly parsed into domains and for topologically complex (high contact order) proteins with swapping of segments between domains. However, for the remaining targets, at least one of the five submitted models had a long fragment with significant similarity to the native structure. A fully automated version of the CASP5 protocol produced results that were comparable to the human-assisted predictions for most of the targets, suggesting that automated genomic-scale, de novo protein structure prediction may soon be worthwhile. For the three targets where the human-assisted predictions were significantly closer to the native structure, we identify the steps that remain to be automated.",

        "abstract": "The regulation of extracellular glutamate in the nucleus accumbens by group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3) was examined in vivo. Stimulation of mGluR2/3 with 2R,4R-4-aminopyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (APDC) or N-acetylaspartylglutamate reduced extracellular glutamate levels. Conversely, blockade of mGluR2/3 by LY143495 or (RS)-1-amino-5-phosphonoindan-1-carboxylic acid (APICA) increased extracellular glutamate, an effect antagonized by the coadministration of APDC. These effects likely involve both vesicular and nonvesicular glutamate, because the increase in glutamate by APICA or the decrease by APDC was prevented by blocking N-type calcium channels and the release of glutamate after potassium-induced membrane depolarization was antagonized by APDC. In addition, blockade of the cystine-glutamate exchange, a major nonvesicular source of extracellular glutamate, by (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine blocked the effects induced by either APDC or APICA. However, blockade of Na(+) channels by tetrodotoxin or Na(+)-dependent glutamate transporters by DL-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate failed to affect the alterations in extracellular glutamate by APICA or APDC, respectively. Group II mGluRs are G(i)-coupled and coperfusion with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activator Sp-cAMPS blocked the reduction in glutamate by APDC and the PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPS prevented the elevation in glutamate by APICA. Taken together, these data support three conclusions: 1) group II mGluRs regulate both vesicular and nonvesicular release of glutamate in the nucleus accumbens, 2) there is tonic in vivo stimulation of mGluR2/3 by endogenous glutamate, and 3) modulation of group II mGluRs of extracellular glutamate is Ca(2+)- and PKA-dependent.",

Effectors delivered by the T6SS are loaded within the inner tube or on the spike complex and can target prokaryotic and/or eukaryotic cells.

The final scaffolds bound b12 with high specificity and with affinity similar to that of gp120, and crystallographic analysis of a scaffold bound to b12 revealed high structural mimicry of the gp120-b12 complex structure.

We describe new tools for identifying inaccuracies in energy functions and guiding their improvement, and illustrate the application of these tools to the improvement of the Rosetta energy function. The feature analysis tool identifies discrepancies between structures deposited in the PDB and low-energy structures generated by Rosetta; these likely arise from inaccuracies in the energy function. The optE tool optimizes the weights on the different components of the energy function by maximizing the recapitulation of a wide range of experimental observations. We use the tools to examine three proposed modifications to the Rosetta energy function: improving the unfolded state energy model (reference energies), using bicubic spline interpolation to generate knowledge-based torisonal potentials, and incorporating the recently developed Dunbrack 2010 rotamer library (Shapovalov & Dunbrack, 2011).",

Here we show that computationally designed, two-component nanoparticle immunogens2 induce potently neutralizing and broadly protective antibody responses against a wide variety of influenza viruses. The nanoparticle immunogens contain 20 haemagglutinin glycoprotein trimers in an ordered array, and their assembly in vitro enables the precisely controlled co-display of multiple distinct haemagglutinin proteins in defined ratios. Nanoparticle immunogens that co-display the four haemagglutinins of licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines elicited antibody responses in several animal models against vaccine-matched strains that were equivalent to or better than commercial quadrivalent influenza vaccines, and simultaneously induced broadly protective antibody responses to heterologous viruses by targeting the subdominant yet conserved haemagglutinin stem. The combination of potent receptor-blocking and cross-reactive stem-directed antibodies induced by the nanoparticle immunogens makes them attractive candidates for a supraseasonal influenza vaccine candidate with the potential to replace conventional seasonal vaccines3.",

During the maturation process, the catalytically active protease domain is released from the larger polypeptide or pro-enzyme by one or more proteolytic processing steps. In several well studied cases, amino-terminal pro regions have been shown to play a fundamental role in the folding of the associated protease domains. The mechanism by which pro regions facilitate folding appears to be significantly different from that used by the molecular chaperones. Recent results suggest that the pro region assisted folding mechanism may be used by a wide variety of proteases, and perhaps even by non-proteases.",

This process, conserved among dsDNA viruses such as herpes viruses and bacteriophages, is key to forming infectious virions. Bacteriophage P22 has served as a model system for this study in the past several decades. However, how capsid assembly is initiated, where and how scaffolding proteins bind to coat proteins in the procapsid, and the conformational changes upon capsid maturation still remain elusive. Here, we report Cα backbone models for the P22 procapsid and infectious virion derived from electron cryomicroscopy density maps determined at 3.8- and 4.0-Å resolution, respectively, and the first procapsid structure at subnanometer resolution without imposing symmetry. The procapsid structures show the scaffolding protein interacting electrostatically with the N terminus (N arm) of the coat protein through its C-terminal helix-loop-helix motif, as well as unexpected interactions between 10 scaffolding proteins and the 12-fold portal located at a unique vertex. These suggest a critical role for the scaffolding proteins both in initiating the capsid assembly at the portal vertex and propagating its growth on a T = 7 icosahedral lattice. Comparison of the procapsid and the virion backbone models reveals coordinated and complex conformational changes. These structural observations allow us to propose a more detailed molecular mechanism for the scaffolding-mediated capsid assembly initiation including portal incorporation, release of scaffolding proteins upon DNA packaging, and maturation into infectious virions.",

Also called a cystine-glutamate antiporter, system x(c)(-) typically functions by exchanging one molecule of extracellular cystine for one molecule of intracellular glutamate. Nonvesicular glutamate released during cystine-glutamate exchange activates extrasynaptic glutamate receptors in a manner that shapes synaptic activity and plasticity. These findings contribute to the intriguing possibility that extracellular glutamate is regulated by a complex network of release and reuptake mechanisms, many of which are unique to glutamate and rarely depicted in models of excitatory signaling. Because system x(c)(-) is often expressed on non-neuronal cells, the study of cystine-glutamate exchange may advance the emerging viewpoint that glia are active contributors to information processing in the brain. It is noteworthy that system x(c)(-) is at the interface between excitatory signaling and oxidative stress, because the uptake of cystine that results from cystine-glutamate exchange is critical in maintaining the levels of glutathione, a critical antioxidant. As a result of these dual functions, system x(c)(-) has been implicated in a wide array of central nervous system diseases ranging from addiction to neurodegenerative disorders to schizophrenia. In the current review, we briefly discuss the major cellular components that regulate glutamate homeostasis, including glutamate release by system x(c)(-). This is followed by an in-depth discussion of system x(c)(-) as it relates to glutamate release, cystine transport, and glutathione synthesis. Finally, the role of system x(c)(-) is surveyed across a number of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.",

Separated by only 10-20 million years, Brassica species and Arabidopsis thaliana are closely related, and it is expected that knowledge obtained relating to Arabidopsis growth and development can be translated into Brassicas for crop improvement. Moreover, certain aspects of plant development are sufficiently different between Brassica and Arabidopsis to warrant studies to be carried out directly in the crop species. However, mutating individual genes in the amphidiploid Brassicas such as B. napus and B. juncea may, on the other hand, not give rise to expected phenotypes as the genomes of these species can contain up to six orthologues per single-copy Arabidopsis gene. In order to elucidate and possibly exploit the function of redundant genes for oilseed rape crop improvement, it may therefore be more efficient to study the effects in one of the diploid Brassica species such as B. rapa.

Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) are an attractive source of experimental restraints for NMR structure determination, particularly rapid, high-throughput methods, because they yield both local and long-range orientational information and can be easily measured and assigned once the backbone resonances of a protein have been assigned. While very extensive RDC data sets have been used to determine the structure of ubiquitin, it is unclear to what extent such methods will generalize to larger proteins with less complete data sets. Here we incorporate experimental RDC restraints into Rosetta, an ab initio structure prediction method, and demonstrate that the combined algorithm provides a general method for de novo determination of a variety of protein folds from RDC data. Backbone structures for multiple proteins up to approximately 125 residues in length and spanning a range of topological complexities are rapidly and reproducibly generated using data sets that are insufficient in isolation to uniquely determine the protein fold de novo, although ambiguities and errors are observed for proteins with symmetry about an axis of the alignment tensor. The models generated are not high-resolution structures completely defined by experimental data but are sufficiently accurate to accelerate traditional high-resolution NMR structure determination and provide structure-based functional insights.",

Guided by results obtained on exactly solvable model problems, we transform the problem of diffusion in a potential into free diffusion in the presence of an absorbing zone spanning the entrance to the binding funnel. The free diffusion problem is solved using a recently derived analytic expression for the rate of association of asymmetrically oriented molecules. Despite the required high steric specificity and the absence of long-range attractive interactions, the computed rates are typically on the order of 10(4)-10(6) M(-1) sec(-1), several orders of magnitude higher than rates obtained using a purely probabilistic model in which the association rate for free diffusion of uniformly reactive molecules is multiplied by the probability of a correct alignment of the two partners in a random collision. As the association rates of many protein-protein complexes are also in the 10(5)-10(6) M(-1) sec(-1) range, our results suggest that free energy barriers arising from desolvation and/or side-chain freezing during complex formation or increased ruggedness within the binding funnel, which are completely neglected in our simple diffusional model, do not contribute significantly to the dynamics of protein-protein association. The transparent physical interpretation of our approach that computes association rates directly from the size and geometry of protein-protein binding funnels makes it a useful complement to Brownian dynamics simulations.",

The SH3 domain from Grb2 (Grb2-SH3) presents the typical structure of an SH3 domain composed of two three-stranded antiparallel β-sheets orthogonally packed onto each other, to form a single hydrophobic core. Grb2 interacts, via SH3 domain, with Gab2, a scaffolding disordered protein, triggering some key metabolic pathways involved in cell death and differentiation. In this work we report a mutational analysis (Φ value analysis) of the folding pathway of Grb2-SH3 that, coupled with molecular dynamic simulations, allows us to assess the structure of the transition state and the mechanism of folding of this domain. Data suggest that Grb2-SH3 folds via a native-like, diffused transition state with a concurrent formation of native-like secondary and tertiary structure (nucleation-condensation mechanism) and without the accumulation of folding intermediates. The comparison between our data and previous folding studies on SH3 domains belonging to other proteins highlights that proteins of this class may fold via alternative pathways, stabilized by different nuclei leading or not to accumulation of folding intermediates. This comparative analysis suggests that the alternative folding pathways for this class of SH3 domains can be selectively regulated by the specific amino acid sequences.",

In the simplest examples, viruses use capsids to surround their genomes. Although these naturally occurring systems have been modified to change their tropism and to display proteins or peptides, billions of years of evolution have favoured efficiency at the expense of modularity, making viral capsids difficult to engineer. Synthetic systems composed of non-viral proteins could provide a 'blank slate' to evolve desired properties for drug delivery and other biomedical applications, while avoiding the safety risks and engineering challenges associated with viruses. Here we create synthetic nucleocapsids, which are computationally designed icosahedral protein assemblies with positively charged inner surfaces that can package their own full-length mRNA genomes. We explore the ability of these nucleocapsids to evolve virus-like properties by generating diversified populations using Escherichia coli as an expression host. Several generations of evolution resulted in markedly improved genome packaging (more than 133-fold), stability in blood (from less than 3.7% to 71% of packaged RNA protected after 6 hours of treatment), and in vivo circulation time (from less than 5 minutes to approximately 4.5 hours). The resulting synthetic nucleocapsids package one full-length RNA genome for every 11 icosahedral assemblies, similar to the best recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors. Our results show that there are simple evolutionary paths through which protein assemblies can acquire virus-like genome packaging and protection. Considerable effort has been directed at 'top-down' modification of viruses to be safe and effective for drug delivery and vaccine applications; the ability to design synthetic nanomaterials computationally and to optimize them through evolution now enables a complementary 'bottom-up' approach with considerable advantages in programmability and control.",

Using the motility of Plasmodium berghei ookinetes as a signalling paradigm, we show that the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase, PKG, maintains the elevated level of cytosolic Ca²⁺ required for gliding motility. We find that the same PKG-dependent pathway operates upstream of the Ca²⁺ signals that mediate activation of P. berghei gametocytes in the mosquito and egress of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites from infected human erythrocytes. Perturbations of PKG signalling in gliding ookinetes have a marked impact on the phosphoproteome, with a significant enrichment of in vivo regulated sites in multiple pathways including vesicular trafficking and phosphoinositide metabolism. A global analysis of cellular phospholipids demonstrates that in gliding ookinetes PKG controls phosphoinositide biosynthesis, possibly through the subcellular localisation or activity of lipid kinases. Similarly, phosphoinositide metabolism links PKG to egress of P. falciparum merozoites, where inhibition of PKG blocks hydrolysis of phosphatidylinostitol (4,5)-bisphosphate. In the face of an increasing complexity of signalling through multiple Ca²⁺ effectors, PKG emerges as a unifying factor to control multiple cellular Ca²⁺ signals essential for malaria parasite development and transmission.",

        "abstract": "Repeated cocaine produces enduring neuroadaptations in glutamate transmission in the nucleus accumbens that are thought to contribute to addiction. Group II metabotropic glutamate autoreceptors (mGluR2/3) regulate glutamate release, and this study investigates whether repeated cocaine injection produces long-lasting alterations in mGluR2/3 content, phosphorylation, and physiology. Rats were administered cocaine daily for 1 week, and 3 weeks after the last injection, mGluR2/3 protein levels were altered in the accumbens and prefrontal cortex (PFC) but not in the dorsal striatum or ventral tegmental area. The level of mGluR2/3 dimer was elevated in the accumbens and PFC and the monomer was reduced in the PFC only. Furthermore, the relative Ser phosphorylation state of the monomer was elevated in both the accumbens and PFC of cocaine-pretreated subjects, whereas the dimer demonstrated negligible phosphorylation in either treatment group. These changes in mGluR2/3 level and phosphorylation state were associated with reduced mGluR2/3 agonist-induced guanosine 5'-3-O -(thio)triphosphate binding in the accumbens and PFC, but not in the dorsal striatum. Stimulation of mGluR2/3 reduces extracellular glutamate by inhibiting Ca(2+)-dependent and cystine/glutamate antiporter-mediated glutamate release. The capacity of the mGluR2/3 agonist 2R,4R-4-aminopyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (APDC) to inhibit [(35)S]cystine uptake via cystine/glutamate antiporter in accumbens tissue slices was reduced by repeated cocaine. Also, the capacity of APDC to reduce the basal and potassium-stimulated extrasynaptic glutamate was significantly blunted in the accumbens of cocaine-pretreated subjects. Together, these data demonstrate that repeated cocaine produces an enduring reduction in mGluR2/3 function in the nucleus accumbens.",

To characterize the rate-limiting conformational changes that underlie two-state folding, we have investigated experimentally the effects of changing solvent viscosity on the refolding of the IgG binding domain of protein L. In conjunction with numerical simulations, our results indicate that the rate-limiting conformational changes of the folding of this domain are strongly coupled to solvent viscosity and lack any significant \"internal friction\" arising from intrachain collisions. When compared with the previously determined solvent viscosity dependencies of other, more restricted conformational changes, our results suggest that the rate-limiting folding transition involves conformational fluctuations that displace considerable amounts of solvent. Reconciling evidence that the folding transition state ensemble is comprised of highly collapsed species with these and similar, previously reported results should provide a significant constraint for theoretical models of the folding process.",

Proteins with misfolded domains in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen or membrane are discarded through the ERAD-L and ERAD-M pathways, respectively. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both pathways require the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1, a multi-spanning membrane protein with a cytosolic RING finger domain. Hrd1 is the crucial membrane component for retro-translocation, but it is unclear whether it forms a protein-conducting channel. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of S. cerevisiae Hrd1 in complex with its endoplasmic reticulum luminal binding partner, Hrd3. Hrd1 forms a dimer within the membrane with one or two Hrd3 molecules associated at its luminal side. Each Hrd1 molecule has eight transmembrane segments, five of which form an aqueous cavity extending from the cytosol almost to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, while a segment of the neighbouring Hrd1 molecule forms a lateral seal. The aqueous cavity and lateral gate are reminiscent of features of protein-conducting conduits that facilitate polypeptide movement in the opposite direction-from the cytosol into or across membranes. Our results suggest that Hrd1 forms a retro-translocation channel for the movement of misfolded polypeptides through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.",

We evaluated the extent to which a variety of all-atom energy functions could identify the native and close-to-native structures in the new decoy sets. Of various implicit solvent models, we found that a solvent-accessible surface area-based solvation provided the best enrichment and discrimination of close-to-native decoys. The combination of this solvation treatment with Lennard Jones terms and the original Rosetta energy provided better enrichment and discrimination than any of the individual terms.

This allows Gcn4 to bind Gal11 in multiple conformations and orientations, an example of a \"fuzzy\" complex, where the Gcn4-Gal11 interface cannot be described by a single conformation. Gcn4 uses a similar mechanism to bind two other unrelated activator-binding domains.

This convincingly demonstrates that the anomalous temperature dependence of folding derives from the temperature dependence of the interactions that stabilize proteins, rather than from the super Arrhenius temperature dependence predicted for the configurational diffusion constant on a rough energy landscape. However, because of the limited temperature range accessible to experiment, the results do not rule out models with higher order temperature dependences.

Although the activities of designed catalysts have been quite low, extensive laboratory evolution has been used to generate efficient enzymes. Structural analysis of these systems has revealed the high degree of precision that will be needed to design catalysts with greater activity. To this end, emerging protein design methods, including deep learning, hold particular promise for improving model accuracy.

However, the number of such switches is limited, and reengineering them is challenging. Here we show that a general class of protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which the binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest2. The designed sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state and an open luminescent state; analyte binding drives the switch from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor is based on the thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We create biosensors that can sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the HER2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac troponin I and an anti-hepatitis B virus antibody with the high sensitivity required to detect these molecules clinically. Given the need for diagnostic tools to track the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)3, we used the approach to design sensors for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antibodies against the membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. The former, which incorporates a de novo designed spike receptor binding domain (RBD) binder4, has a limit of detection of 15 pM and a luminescence signal 50-fold higher than the background level. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes, and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.",

        "abstract": "A role for the Plasmodium falciparum cyclic GMP (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase (PfPKG) in gametogenesis in the malaria parasite was elucidated previously. In the present study we examined the role of PfPKG in the asexual blood-stage of the parasite life cycle, the stage that causes malaria pathology. A specific PKG inhibitor (compound 1, a trisubstituted pyrrole) prevented the progression of P. falciparum schizonts through to ring stages in erythrocyte invasion assays. Addition of compound 1 to ring-stage parasites allowed normal development up to 30 h postinvasion, and segmented schizonts were able to form. However, synchronized schizonts treated with compound 1 for ≥6 h became large and dysmorphic and were unable to rupture or liberate merozoites. To conclusively demonstrate that the effect of compound 1 on schizogony was due to its selective action on PfPKG, we utilized genetically manipulated P. falciparum parasites expressing a compound 1-insensitive PfPKG. The mutant parasites were able to complete schizogony in the presence of compound 1 but not in the presence of the broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine. This shows that PfPKG is the primary target of compound 1 during schizogony and provides direct evidence of a role for PfPKG in this process. Discovery of essential roles for the P. falciparum PKG in both asexual and sexual development demonstrates that cGMP signaling is a key regulator of both of these crucial life cycle phases and defines this molecule as an exciting potential drug target for both therapeutic and transmission blocking action against malaria.",

Study of more rudimentary (wo)man-made enzymes provides a unique opportunity for better understanding of enzymatic catalysis. KE07, a computationally designed Kemp eliminase that employs a glutamate side chain as the catalytic base for the critical proton abstraction step and an apolar binding site to guide substrate binding, was optimized by seven rounds of random mutagenesis and selection, resulting in a >200-fold increase in catalytic efficiency. Here, we describe the directed evolution process in detail and the biophysical and crystallographic studies of the designed KE07 and its evolved variants. The optimization of KE07's activity to give a k(cat)/K(M) value of approximately 2600 s(-1) M(-1) and an approximately 10(6)-fold rate acceleration (k(cat)/k(uncat)) involved the incorporation of up to eight mutations. These mutations led to a marked decrease in the overall thermodynamic stability of the evolved KE07s and in the configurational stability of their active sites. We identified two primary contributions of the mutations to KE07's improved activity: (i) the introduction of new salt bridges to correct a mistake in the original design that placed a lysine for leaving-group protonation without consideration of its \"quenching\" interactions with the catalytic glutamate, and (ii) the tuning of the environment, the pK(a) of the catalytic base, and its interactions with the substrate through the evolution of a network of hydrogen bonds consisting of several charged residues surrounding the active site.",

Random mutagenesis and screening resulted in variants with >200-fold higher catalytic efficiency and provided insights about features missing in the designed enzyme.

        "abstract": "The kinetics of folding of a tryptophan containing mutant of the IgG binding domain of protein L were characterized using stopped-flow circular dichroism, stopped-flow fluorescence, and HD exchange coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Both the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding fit well to a simple two-state model: (1) Guanidine induced equilibrium denaturation transitions measured by fluorescence and circular dichroism were virtually superimposable. (2) The kinetics of folding/unfolding were single exponential under all conditions examined, and the rate constants obtained using all probes were similar. (3) Mass spectra from pulsed HD exchange refolding experiments showed that a species with very little protection from exchange is converted to a fully protected species (the native state) at a rate very similar to that of the overall change in tryptophan fluorescence; no intervening partially protected species were observed. (4) Rate constants (in H2O) and m values for folding and unfolding determined by fitting observed relaxation rates obtained over a broad range of denaturant concentrations to a two-state model were consistent with the equilibrium parameters deltaG and m: -RT ln(k(u)/k(f))/deltaG(U)H2O = 1.02; (m(u) + m(f))/m = 1.08. In contrast to results with a number of other proteins, there was no deviation from linearity in plots of ln k(obs) versus guanidine at low guanidine concentrations, both in the presence and absence of 0.4 M Na2SO4, suggesting that significantly stabilized intermediates do not accumulate during folding. Although all of the change in fluorescence signal during folding in phosphate buffer was accounted for by the simple exponential describing the overall folding reaction, fluorescence-quenching experiments using sodium iodide revealed a small reduction in the extent of quenching of the protein within the first two milliseconds after initiation of refolding in low concentrations of guanidine, suggesting a partial collapse of the unfolded chain may occur under these conditions. Comparison with results on the structurally and functionally similar IgG binding domain of streptococcal protein G show intriguing differences in the folding of the two proteins.",

        "abstract": "Naturally occurring homooligomeric protein complexes exhibit striking internal symmetry. The evolutionary origins of this symmetry have been the subject of considerable speculation; proposals for the advantages associated with symmetry include greater folding efficiency, reduced aggregation, amenability to allosteric regulation, and greater adaptability. An alternative possibility stems from the idea that to contribute to fitness, and hence be subject to evolutionary optimization, a complex must be significantly populated, which implies that the interaction energy between monomers in the ancestors of modern-day complexes must have been sufficient to at least partially overcome the entropic cost of association. Here, we investigate the effects of this bias toward very-low-energy complexes on the distribution of symmetry in primordial homooligomers modeled as randomly interacting pairs of monomers. We demonstrate quantitatively that a bias toward very-low-energy complexes can result in the emergence of symmetry from random ensembles in which the overall frequency of symmetric complexes is vanishingly small. This result is corroborated by using explicit protein-protein docking calculations to generate ensembles of randomly docked complexes: the fraction of these that are symmetric increases from 0.02% in the overall population to >50% in very low energy subpopulations.",

In natural active sites, nucleophilic elements such as catalytic dyads and triads are usually paired with oxyanion holes for substrate activation, but it is difficult to parse out the independent contributions of these elements or to understand how they emerged in the course of evolution. Here we explore the minimal requirements for esterase activity by computationally designing artificial catalysts using catalytic dyads and oxyanion holes. We found much higher success rates using designed oxyanion holes formed by backbone NH groups rather than by side chains or bridging water molecules and obtained four active designs in different scaffolds by combining this motif with a Cys-His dyad. Following active site optimization, the most active of the variants exhibited a catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(M)) of 400 M(-1) s(-1) for the cleavage of a p-nitrophenyl ester. Kinetic experiments indicate that the active site cysteines are rapidly acylated as programmed by design, but the subsequent slow hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate limits overall catalytic efficiency. Moreover, the Cys-His dyads are not properly formed in crystal structures of the designed enzymes. These results highlight the challenges that computational design must overcome to achieve high levels of activity.",

Ookinetes use an acto-myosin motor to glide towards and penetrate the midgut wall to establish infection in the vector. The regulation of gliding motility is poorly understood. Through genetic interaction studies we here describe a signalling module that identifies guanosine 3′, 5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) as an important second messenger regulating ookinete differentiation and motility. In ookinetes lacking the cyclic nucleotide degrading phosphodiesterase δ (PDEδ), unregulated signalling through cGMP results in rounding up of the normally banana-shaped cells. This phenotype is suppressed in a double mutant additionally lacking guanylyl cyclase β (GCβ), showing that in ookinetes GCβ is an important source for cGMP, and that PDEδ is the relevant cGMP degrading enzyme. Inhibition of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase, PKG, blocks gliding, whereas enhanced signalling through cGMP restores normal gliding speed in a mutant lacking calcium dependent protein kinase 3, suggesting at least a partial overlap between calcium and cGMP dependent pathways. These data demonstrate an important function for signalling through cGMP, and most likely PKG, in dynamically regulating ookinete gliding during the transmission of malaria to the mosquito.",

By contrast, specificity of protein-protein interactions usually involves backbone shape complementarity1, which is less modular and hence harder to generalize. Coiled-coil heterodimers are an exception, but the restricted geometry of interactions across the heterodimer interface (primarily at the heptad a and d positions2) limits the number of orthogonal pairs that can be created simply by varying side-chain interactions3,4. Here we show that protein-protein interaction specificity can be achieved using extensive and modular side-chain hydrogen-bond networks. We used the Crick generating equations5 to produce millions of four-helix backbones with varying degrees of supercoiling around a central axis, identified those accommodating extensive hydrogen-bond networks, and used Rosetta to connect pairs of helices with short loops and to optimize the remainder of the sequence. Of 97 such designs expressed in Escherichia coli, 65 formed constitutive heterodimers, and the crystal structures of four designs were in close agreement with the computational models and confirmed the designed hydrogen-bond networks. In cells, six heterodimers were fully orthogonal, and in vitro-following mixing of 32 chains from 16 heterodimer designs, denaturation in 5 M guanidine hydrochloride and reannealing-almost all of the interactions observed by native mass spectrometry were between the designed cognate pairs. The ability to design orthogonal protein heterodimers should enable sophisticated protein-based control logic for synthetic biology, and illustrates that nature has not fully explored the possibilities for programmable biomolecular interaction modalities.",

Here, we enumerate the stable structures that can be adopted by macrocyclic peptides composed of l- and d-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence design and energy landscape calculations. We identify more than 200 designs predicted to fold into single stable structures, many times more than the number of currently available unbound peptide macrocycle structures. Nuclear magnetic resonance structures of 9 of 12 designed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic designs, are close to the computational models.

Here we study the exceptions to this general trend-directly coevolving residue pairs that are distant in protein structures-to determine the origins of evolutionary pressure on spatially distant residues and to understand the sources of error in contact-based structure prediction. Over a set of 4,000 protein families, we find that 25% of directly coevolving residue pairs are separated by more than 5 Å in protein structures and 3% by more than 15 Å. The majority (91%) of directly coevolving residue pairs in the 5-15 Å range are found to be in contact in at least one homologous structure-these exceptions arise from structural variation in the family in the region containing the residues. Thirty-five percent of the exceptions greater than 15 Å are at homo-oligomeric interfaces, 19% arise from family structural variation, and 27% are in repeat proteins likely reflecting alignment errors. Of the remaining long-range exceptions (<1% of the total number of coupled pairs), many can be attributed to close interactions in an oligomeric state. Overall, the results suggest that directly coevolving residue pairs not in repeat proteins are spatially proximal in at least one biologically relevant protein conformation within the family; we find little evidence for direct coupling between residues at spatially separated allosteric and functional sites or for increased direct coupling between residue pairs on putative allosteric pathways connecting them.",

To investigate the role of clathrin in intercompartmental protein transport, two pathways have been monitored in chcl cells: transport of newly synthesized vacuolar proteins to the vacuole and receptor- mediated uptake of mating pheromone. Newly synthesized precursors of the vacuolar protease carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) were converted to mature CPY with similar kinetics in mutant and wild-type cells. chcl cells did not aberrantly secrete CPY and immunolocalization techniques revealed most of the CPY in chcl cells within morphologically identifiable vacuolar structures. Receptor-mediated internalization of the mating pheromone alpha-factor occurred in chcl cells at 36-50% wild-type levels. The mutant cells were fully competent to respond to pheromone- induced cell-cycle arrest. These results argue that in yeast, clathrin may not play an essential role either in vacuolar protein sorting and delivery or in receptor-mediated endocytosis of alpha-factor. Alternative mechanisms ordinarily may execute these pathways, or be activated in clathrin-deficient cells.",

Ideally, the final stages should be able to identify the native state, show a good correlation with native similarity in order to add value to the selection process, and refine the structures even further.

Dissection of the LIF-gp130 interface, along with comparative studies of other gp130 cytokines, reveal that gp130 has evolved a \"thermodynamic plasticity\" that is relatively insensitive to ligand structure, to enable crossreactivity.

Due to the low mechanical stability of the ferredoxin-like fold structure, swelling of hydrogels causes a significant fraction of the folded domains to unfold. Subsequent collapse and aggregation of unfolded ferredoxin-like domains leads to intertwining of physically and chemically cross-linked networks, entailing hydrogels with unusual physical and mechanical properties: a negative swelling ratio, high stretchability and toughness. These hydrogels can withstand an average strain of 450% before breaking and show massive energy dissipation. Upon relaxation, refolding of the ferredoxin-like domains enables the hydrogel to recover its massive hysteresis.

We tested the method on 12 membrane proteins of diverse topologies and functions with lengths ranging between 190 and 300 residues. Enforcing a single constraint during the folding simulations enriched the population of near-native models for 9 proteins. In 4 of the cases in which the constraint was predicted from the sequence, 1 of the 5 lowest energy models was superimposable within 4 A on the native structure. Near-native structures could also be selected for heme-binding and pore-forming domains from simulations in which pairs of conserved histidine-chelating hemes and one experimentally determined salt bridge were constrained, respectively. These results suggest that models within 4 A of the native structure can be achieved for complex membrane proteins if even limited information on residue-residue interactions can be obtained from protein structure databases or experiments.",

Loss of rho function causes ventralization of the eggshell and the embryo, whereas ectopic expression leads to dorsalization of both structures. Thus, spatially restricted rho is necessary and sufficient for dorsal-ventral axis formation.

We constructed four tests to identify bottlenecks in our current approach and to guide progress in this challenging area. The first three tests showed that idealized native structures are stable under our refinement simulation conditions and that the refinement protocol can significantly decrease the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of perturbed native structures. In the fourth test we applied the refinement protocol to de novo models and showed that accurate models could be identified based on their energies, and in several cases many of the buried side chains adopted native-like conformations. We also showed that the differences in backbone and side-chain conformations between the refined de novo models and the native structures are largely localized to loop regions and regions where the native structure has unusual features such as rare rotamers or atypical hydrogen bonding between beta-strands. The refined de novo models typically have higher energies than refined idealized native structures, indicating that sampling of local backbone conformations and side-chain packing arrangements in a condensed state is a primary obstacle.",

        "abstract": "Addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder hypothesized to be produced by drug-induced plasticity that renders individuals vulnerable to craving-inducing stimuli such as re-exposure to the drug of abuse. Drug-induced plasticity that may result in the addiction phenotype includes increased excitatory signaling within corticostriatal pathways that correlates with craving in humans and is necessary for reinstatement in rodents. Reduced cystine-glutamate exchange by system x(c)- appears to contribute to heightened excitatory signaling within the striatum, thereby posing this as a novel target in the treatment of addiction. In the present report, we examined the impact of repeated N-acetyl cysteine, which is commonly used to activate cystine-glutamate exchange, on reinstatement in rodents in a preclinical study and on craving in cocaine-dependent humans in a preliminary, proof-of-concept clinical experiment. Interestingly, repeated administration (7 days) of N-acetyl cysteine (60 mg/kg, IP) produced a significant reduction in cocaine (10 mg/kg, IP)-induced reinstatement, even though rats (N=10-12/group) were tested 24 h after the last administration of N-acetyl cysteine. The reduction in behavior despite the absence of the N-acetyl cysteine indicates that repeated N-acetyl cysteine may have altered drug-induced plasticity that underlies drug-seeking behavior.

Each fibril is made of a particular protein, yet they share common properties. One such property is nucleation-dependent fibril growth. Monomers of amyloid-forming proteins can remain in dissolved form for long periods, before rapidly assembly into fibrils. The lag before growth has been attributed to slow kinetics of formation of a nucleus, on which other molecules can deposit to form the fibril. We have explored the energetics of fibril formation, based on the known molecular structure of a fibril-forming peptide from the yeast prion, Sup35, using both classical and quantum (density functional theory) methods. We find that the energetics of fibril formation for the first three layers are cooperative using both methods. This cooperativity is consistent with the observation that formation of amyloid fibrils involves slow nucleation and faster growth.",

These results indicate that the folding of Top7 is significantly less cooperative than the folding of similarly sized naturally occurring proteins, suggesting that the cooperative folding and smooth free energy landscapes observed for small naturally occurring proteins are not general properties of polypeptide chains that fold to unique stable structures but are instead a product of natural selection.",

With the incorporation of NMR chemical shift information, accurate models can be obtained consistently for symmetric complexes with as many as 192 total amino acids; a blind prediction was within 1 A rmsd of the traditionally determined NMR structure, and fit independently collected RDC data equally well. Together, these results show that the Rosetta \"fold-and-dock\" protocol can produce models of homo-oligomeric complexes with near-atomic-level accuracy and should be useful for crystallographic phasing and the rapid determination of the structures of multimers with limited NMR information.",

We implement AND gates to redirect T cell specificity against tumor cells expressing two surface antigens while avoiding off-target recognition of single-antigen cells, and three-input switches that add NOT or OR logic to avoid or include cells expressing a third antigen.

We demonstrate the control afforded by the resulting extended rule set by designing a series of proteins with the same fold but considerable variation in secondary structure length, loop geometry, β-strand registry, and overall shape. Solution NMR structures of four designed proteins for two different folds show that protein shape and size can be precisely controlled within a given protein fold.

X-ray crystallography of the enzyme-product complex shows that the molecular changes introduced over the course of optimization, including addition of a lid structure, gradually reshaped the pocket for more effective substrate preorganization and transition state stabilization. The good overall agreement between the experimental structure and the original design model with respect to the orientations of both the bound product and the catalytic side chains contrasts with other computationally designed enzymes.

Herein, we build on previous point mutagenesis studies of the src SH3 by directly investigating the association of structural elements and the loss of backbone conformational entropy during folding. Double-mutant analysis of polar residues in the distal beta-hairpin and the diverging turn indicates that the hydrogen bond network between these elements is largely formed in the folding transition state. A 10-glycine insertion in the n-src loop (which connects the distal hairpin and the diverging turn) and a disulfide crosslink at the base of the distal beta-hairpin exclusively affect the folding rate, showing that these structural elements are nearly as ordered in the folding transition state as in the native state. In contrast, crosslinking the base of the RT loop or the N and C termini dramatically slows down the unfolding rate, suggesting that dissociation of the termini and opening of the RT loop precede the rate-limiting step in unfolding. Taken together, these results suggest that essentially all conformations in the folding transition state ensemble have the central three-stranded beta-sheet formed, indicating that, for the src homology 3 domain, there is a discrete order to structure assembly during folding.",

        "abstract": "The protein design problem is to identify an amino acid sequence that folds to a desired structure. Given Anfinsen's thermodynamic hypothesis of folding, this can be recast as finding an amino acid sequence for which the desired structure is the lowest energy state. As this calculation involves not only all possible amino acid sequences but also, all possible structures, most current approaches focus instead on the more tractable problem of finding the lowest-energy amino acid sequence for the desired structure, often checking by protein structure prediction in a second step that the desired structure is indeed the lowest-energy conformation for the designed sequence, and typically discarding a large fraction of designed sequences for which this is not the case. Here, we show that by backpropagating gradients through the transform-restrained Rosetta (trRosetta) structure prediction network from the desired structure to the input amino acid sequence, we can directly optimize over all possible amino acid sequences and all possible structures in a single calculation. We find that trRosetta calculations, which consider the full conformational landscape, can be more effective than Rosetta single-point energy estimations in predicting folding and stability of de novo designed proteins. We compare sequence design by conformational landscape optimization with the standard energy-based sequence design methodology in Rosetta and show that the former can result in energy landscapes with fewer alternative energy minima. We show further that more funneled energy landscapes can be designed by combining the strengths of the two approaches: the low-resolution trRosetta model serves to disfavor alternative states, and the high-resolution Rosetta model serves to create a deep energy minimum at the design target structure.",

Although most of the interest has been centered in post-synaptic glutamate receptors, the presynaptic synthesis of glutamate through brain glutaminases may also contribute to imbalances in glutamate homeostasis, a key feature of the glutamatergic hypothesis of addiction. Glutaminases are the main glutamate-producing enzymes in brain and dysregulation of their function have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases and neurological disorders; however, the possible implication of these enzymes in drug addiction remains largely unknown. This mini-review focuses on brain glutaminase isozymes and their alterations by in vivo exposure to drugs of abuse, which are discussed in the context of the glutamate homeostasis theory of addiction. Recent findings from mouse models have shown that drugs induce changes in the expression profiles of key glutamatergic transmission genes, although the molecular mechanisms that regulate drug-induced neuronal sensitization and behavioral plasticity are not clear.",

Genetic studies have associated a number of unique single-nucleotide polymorphisms in MAL with protection against invasive microbial infection, but a molecular understanding has been hampered by a lack of structural information. The present study describes the crystal structure of MAL TIR domain. Significant structural differences exist in the overall fold of MAL compared with other TIR domain structures: A sequence motif comprising a β-strand in other TIR domains instead corresponds to a long loop, placing the functionally important \"BB loop\" proline motif in a unique surface position in MAL.

We have generated a number of designed protein-protein interfaces with very favorable computed binding energies but which do not appear to be formed in experiments, suggesting that there may be important physical chemistry missing in the energy calculations. A total of 28 research groups took up the challenge of determining what is missing: we provided structures of 87 designed complexes and 120 naturally occurring complexes and asked participants to identify energetic contributions and/or structural features that distinguish between the two sets. The community found that electrostatics and solvation terms partially distinguish the designs from the natural complexes, largely due to the nonpolar character of the designed interactions. Beyond this polarity difference, the community found that the designed binding surfaces were, on average, structurally less embedded in the designed monomers, suggesting that backbone conformational rigidity at the designed surface is important for realization of the designed function. These results can be used to improve computational design strategies, but there is still much to be learned; for example, one designed complex, which does form in experiments, was classified by all metrics as a nonbinder.",

We design homotrimers and heterodimers that are stable above pH 6.5 but undergo cooperative, large-scale conformational changes when the pH is lowered and electrostatic and steric repulsion builds up as the network histidine residues become protonated. The transition pH and cooperativity can be controlled through the number of histidine-containing networks and the strength of the surrounding hydrophobic interactions.

Given these limitations, a growing trend in both NMR and MS-based metabolomics is towards targeted profiling or \"quantitative\" metabolomics, wherein compounds are identified and quantified via spectral fitting prior to any statistical analysis. Despite the obvious advantages of this method, targeted profiling is hindered by the time required to perform manual or computer-assisted spectral fitting. In an effort to increase data analysis throughput for NMR-based metabolomics, we have developed an automatic method for identifying and quantifying metabolites in one-dimensional (1D) proton NMR spectra. This new algorithm is capable of using carefully constructed reference spectra and optimizing thousands of variables to reconstruct experimental NMR spectra of biofluids using rules and concepts derived from physical chemistry and NMR theory. The automated profiling program has been tested against spectra of synthetic mixtures as well as biological spectra of urine, serum and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).

A variety of methods now allow the prediction of low-resolution structures of small proteins or protein fragments up to approximately 100 amino acid residues in length. Such low-resolution structures may be sufficient for the functional annotation of protein sequences on a genome-wide scale. Although no consistently reliable algorithm is currently available, the essential challenges to developing a general theory or approach to protein structure prediction are better understood. The energy landscapes resulting from the structure prediction algorithms are only partially funneled to the native state of the protein. This review focuses on two areas of recent advances in ab initio structure prediction-improvements in the energy functions and strategies to search the caldera region of the energy landscapes.",

This requires not only sequence changes that introduce the new functional groups but also sequence changes that remodel the structure of the protein backbone so that the functional groups are properly positioned. We describe a computational design method for introducing specific enzyme-substrate interactions by directed remodeling of loops near the active site. Benchmark tests on 8 native protein-ligand complexes show that the method can recover native loop lengths and, often, native loop conformations. We then use the method to redesign a critical loop in human guanine deaminase such that a key side-chain interaction is made with the substrate ammelide. The redesigned enzyme is 100-fold more active on ammelide and 2.5e4-fold less active on guanine than wild-type enzyme: The net change in specificity is 2.5e6-fold. The structure of the designed protein was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis: The remodeled loop adopts a conformation that is within 1-A Calpha RMSD of the computational model.",

We characterize the degeneracy of the mapping from local sequence to local structure responsible for this failure by investigating the extent to which similar sequence segments found in different proteins adopt similar three-dimensional structures. Sequence segments 3-15 residues in length from 154 different protein families are partitioned into neighborhoods containing segments with similar sequences using cluster analysis. The consistency of the sequence-to-structure mapping is assessed by comparing the local structures adopted by sequence segments in the same neighborhood in proteins of known structure. In the 154 families, 45% and 28% of the positions occur in neighborhoods in which one and two local structures predominate, respectively. The sequence patterns that characterize the neighborhoods in the first class probably include virtually all of the short sequence motifs in proteins that consistently occur in a particular local structure. These patterns, many of which occur in transitions between secondary structural elements, are an interesting combination of previously studied and novel motifs. The identification of sequence patterns that consistently occur in one or a small number of local structures in proteins should contribute to the prediction of protein structure from sequence.",

The LT was not affected by homogenization of the fish muscle. We established a general formula that provides the most conservative model for the prediction of LT. This formula yielded calculated LT's that were very close to observed data and models based on individual experiments. Temperature explained 74.6% of experimental variation in the final multiple linear regression model (r2=0.883). The spore inoculum level accounted for 7.4%, while other factors explained <3% together.

The modular nature of repeat proteins enables the rapid construction and diversification of extended binding surfaces by duplication and recombination of simple building blocks. The overall architecture of tandem repeat protein structures--which is dictated by the internal geometry and local packing of the repeat building blocks--is highly diverse, ranging from extended, super-helical folds that bind peptide, DNA, and RNA partners, to closed and compact conformations with internal cavities suitable for small molecule binding and catalysis. Here we report the development and validation of computational methods for de novo design of tandem repeat protein architectures driven purely by geometric criteria defining the inter-repeat geometry, without reference to the sequences and structures of existing repeat protein families. We have applied these methods to design a series of closed α-solenoid repeat structures (α-toroids) in which the inter-repeat packing geometry is constrained so as to juxtapose the amino (N) and carboxy (C) termini; several of these designed structures have been validated by X-ray crystallography. Unlike previous approaches to tandem repeat protein engineering, our design procedure does not rely on template sequence or structural information taken from natural repeat proteins and hence can produce structures unlike those seen in nature. As an example, we have successfully designed and validated closed α-solenoid repeats with a left-handed helical architecture that--to our knowledge--is not yet present in the protein structure database.",

        "abstract": "Stressful life events are important contributors to relapse in recovering cocaine addicts, but the mechanisms by which they influence motivational systems are poorly understood. Studies suggest that stress may \"set the stage\" for relapse by increasing the sensitivity of brain reward circuits to drug-associated stimuli. We examined the effects of stress and corticosterone on behavioral and neurochemical responses of rats to a cocaine prime after cocaine self-administration and extinction. Exposure of rats to acute electric footshock stress did not by itself reinstate drug-seeking behavior but potentiated reinstatement in response to a subthreshold dose of cocaine. This effect of stress was not observed in adrenalectomized animals, and was reproduced in nonstressed animals by administration of corticosterone at a dose that reproduced stress-induced plasma levels. Pretreatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486 did not block the corticosterone effect. Corticosterone potentiated cocaine-induced increases in extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and pharmacological blockade of NAc dopamine receptors blocked corticosterone-induced potentiation of reinstatement. Intra-accumbens administration of corticosterone reproduced the behavioral effects of stress and systemic corticosterone. Corticosterone treatment acutely decreased NAc dopamine clearance measured by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, suggesting that inhibition of uptake₂-mediated dopamine clearance may underlie corticosterone effects. Consistent with this hypothesis, intra-accumbens administration of the uptake₂ inhibitor normetanephrine potentiated cocaine-induced reinstatement. Expression of organic cation transporter 3, a corticosterone-sensitive uptake₂ transporter, was detected on NAc neurons. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which stress hormones can rapidly regulate dopamine signaling and contribute to the impact of stress on drug intake.",

Crystal structures of the water-soluble forms of a 12-helical pore and a 16-helical pore closely match the computational design models. Patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments show that, when expressed in insect cells, the transmembrane form of the 12-helix pore enables the passage of ions across the membrane with high selectivity for potassium over sodium; ion passage is blocked by specific chemical modification at the pore entrance. When incorporated into liposomes using in vitro protein synthesis, the transmembrane form of the 16-helix pore-but not the 12-helix pore-enables the passage of biotinylated Alexa Fluor 488. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the 16-helix transmembrane pore closely matches the design model. The ability to produce structurally and functionally well-defined transmembrane pores opens the door to the creation of designer channels and pores for a wide variety of applications.",

The cryogenic electron microscopy structure of an optimized design is nearly identical to the computational design model for both the subunit internal geometry and the subunit packing into the fibre. Electron, fluorescent and atomic force microscopy characterization reveal a sharp and reversible transition from assembled to disassembled fibres over 0.3 pH units, and rapid fibre disassembly in less than 1 s following a drop in pH. The midpoint of the transition can be tuned by modulating buried histidine-containing hydrogen bond networks. Computational protein design thus provides a route to creating unbound nanomaterials that rapidly respond to small pH changes.",

Here, we develop a method for generating low-resolution protein structures by using unassigned NMR data that relies on the de novo protein structure prediction algorithm, rosetta [Simons, K. T., Kooperberg, C., Huang, E. & Baker, D. (1997) J. Mol. Biol. 268, 209-225] and a Monte Carlo procedure that searches for the assignment of resonances to atoms that produces the best fit of the experimental NMR data to a candidate 3D structure. A large ensemble of models is generated from sequence information alone by using rosetta, an optimal assignment is identified for each model, and the models are then ranked based on their fit with the NMR data assuming the identified assignments. The method was tested on nine protein sequences between 56 and 140 amino acids and published CS, NOE, and RDC data. The procedure yielded models with rms deviations between 3 and 6 A, and, in four of the nine cases, the partial assignments obtained by the method could be used to refine the structures to high resolution (0.6-1.8 A) by repeated cycles of structure generation guided by the partial assignments, followed by reassignment using the newly generated models.",

The effect on model quality and selection resulting from loop modeling and backbone optimization is also studied. The performance of the method on a benchmark set is reported and shows the approach to be effective at both generating and selecting accurate alignments.

Significant deviations were observed for G22, L38 and K39; increasing the denaturant concentration shifted the chemical shifts of these residues towards theory random coil values. Medium-range nuclear Overhauser enhancements were detected in segments corresponding to the turn between the first two strands, the end of the second strand through the turn between the second strand and the helix, and the turn between the helix and the third strand in 3D H(1), N(15)-HSQC-NOESY-HSQC experiments on perdeuterated samples. Longer-range interactions were probed by measuring the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement produced by nitroxide spin labels introduced via cysteine residues at five sites around the molecule. Damped oscillations in the magnitude of the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement as a function of distance along the sequence suggested native-like chain reversals in the same three turn regions. The more extensive interactions within the region corresponding to the first beta-turn than in the region corresponding to the second beta-turn suggests that the asymmetry in the folding reaction evident in previous studies of the protein L folding transition state is already established in the denatured state.",

        "abstract": "Although much of the motivation for experimental studies of protein folding is to obtain insights for improving protein structure prediction, there has been relatively little connection between experimental protein folding studies and computational structural prediction work in recent years. In the present study, we show that the relationship between protein folding rates and the contact order (CO) of the native structure has implications for ab initio protein structure prediction. Rosetta ab initio folding simulations produce a dearth of high CO structures and an excess of low CO structures, as expected if the computer simulations mimic to some extent the actual folding process. Consistent with this, the majority of failures in ab initio prediction in the CASP4 (critical assessment of structure prediction) experiment involved high CO structures likely to fold much more slowly than the lower CO structures for which reasonable predictions were made. This bias against high CO structures can be partially alleviated by performing large numbers of additional simulations, selecting out the higher CO structures, and eliminating the very low CO structures; this leads to a modest improvement in prediction quality. More significant improvements in predictions for proteins with complex topologies may be possible following significant increases in high-performance computing power, which will be required for thoroughly sampling high CO conformations (high CO proteins can take six orders of magnitude longer to fold than low CO proteins). Importantly for such a strategy, simulations performed for high CO structures converge much less strongly than those for low CO structures, and hence, lack of simulation convergence can indicate the need for improved sampling of high CO conformations. The parallels between Rosetta simulations and folding in vivo may extend to misfolding: The very low CO structures that accumulate in Rosetta simulations consist primarily of local up-down beta-sheets that may resemble precursors to amyloid formation.",

The highlight was the human assisted prediction of T0806, a large and topologically complex target with no homologs of known structure, which had unprecedented accuracy -<3.0 Å root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the crystal structure over 223 residues. For this target, we increased the amount of conformational sampling over our fully automated method by employing an iterative hybridization protocol.

        "abstract": "Repeated cocaine alters glutamate neurotransmission, in part, by reducing cystine-glutamate exchange via system xc-, which maintains glutamate levels and receptor stimulation in the extrasynaptic compartment. In the present study, we undertook two approaches to determine the significance of plasticity involving system xc-. First, we examined whether the cysteine prodrug N-acetylcysteine attenuates cocaine-primed reinstatement by targeting system xc-. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (1 mg/kg/200 microl, i.v.) under extended access conditions (6 h/day). After extinction training, cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) primed reinstatement was assessed in rats pretreated with N-acetylcysteine (0-60 mg/kg, i.p.) in the presence or absence of the system xc- inhibitor (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine (CPG; 0.5 microM; infused into the nucleus accumbens). N-acetylcysteine attenuated cocaine-primed reinstatement, and this effect was reversed by co-administration of CPG. Secondly, we examined whether reduced system xc- activity is necessary for cocaine-primed reinstatement. To do this, we administered N-acetylcysteine (0 or 90 mg/kg, i.p.) prior to 12 daily self-administration sessions (1 mg/kg/200 microl, i.v.; 6 h/day) since this procedure has previously been shown to prevent reduced activity of system xc-. On the reinstatement test day, we then acutely impaired system xc- in some of the rats by infusing CPG (0.5 microM) into the nucleus accumbens. Rats that had received N-acetylcysteine prior to daily self-administration sessions exhibited diminished cocaine-primed reinstatement; this effect was reversed by infusing the cystine-glutamate exchange inhibitor CPG into the nucleus accumbens. Collectively these data establish system xc- in the nucleus accumbens as a key mechanism contributing to cocaine-primed reinstatement.",

        "abstract": "It is important to assess the identity and purity of proteins and protein complexes during and after protein purification to ensure that samples are of sufficient quality for further biochemical and structural characterization, as well as for use in consumer products, chemical processes and therapeutics. Native mass spectrometry (nMS) has become an important tool in protein analysis due to its ability to retain non-covalent interactions during measurements, making it possible to obtain protein structural information with high sensitivity and at high speed. Interferences from the presence of non-volatiles are typically alleviated by offline buffer exchange, which is time-consuming and difficult to automate. We provide a protocol for rapid online buffer exchange (OBE) nMS to directly screen structural features of pre-purified proteins, protein complexes or clarified cell lysates. In the liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach described in this protocol, samples in MS-incompatible conditions are injected onto a short size-exclusion chromatography column. Proteins and protein complexes are separated from small molecule non-volatile buffer components using an aqueous, non-denaturing mobile phase. Eluted proteins and protein complexes are detected by the mass spectrometer after electrospray ionization. Mass spectra can inform regarding protein sample purity and oligomerization, and additional tandem mass spectra can help to further obtain information on protein complex subunits. Information obtained by OBE nMS can be used for fast (<5 min) quality control and can further guide protein expression and purification optimization.",

        "abstract": "Many viral surface glycoproteins and cell surface receptors are homo-oligomers, and thus can potentially be targeted by geometrically matched homo-oligomers that engage all subunits simultaneously to attain high avidity and/or lock subunits together. The adaptive immune system cannot generally employ this strategy since the individual antibody binding sites are not arranged with appropriate geometry to simultaneously engage multiple sites in a single target homo-oligomer. We describe a general strategy for the computational design of homo-oligomeric protein assemblies with binding functionality precisely matched to homo-oligomeric target sites. In the first step, a small protein is designed that binds a single site on the target. In the second step, the designed protein is assembled into a homo-oligomer such that the designed binding sites are aligned with the target sites. We use this approach to design high-avidity trimeric proteins that bind influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) at its conserved receptor binding site. The designed trimers can both capture and detect HA in a paper-based diagnostic format, neutralizes influenza in cell culture, and completely protects mice when given as a single dose 24 h before or after challenge with influenza.",

This requires at least two steps, a rigid-body search that determines the relative position and orientation of the subunits, and a refinement step. The methods developed in the past twenty years yield native-like models in most cases, but always with many false positives that must be filtered out, and they fail when the conformation changes are large. CAPRI (Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions) is a community-wide experiment set up to monitor progress in the field. It offers participants the opportunity to test their methods in blind predictions that are assessed against an unpublished experimental structure. The models submitted by predictor groups are judged depending on how well they reproduce the geometry and the residue-residue contacts seen in the target structure. In nine years of CAPRI, 42 target complexes have been subjected to prediction based on the components' unbound structures. Good models have been submitted for 28 targets, and prediction has failed on 6. Both these successes and these failures have been fruitful, as they stimulated participant groups to develop new score functions to identify native-like solutions, and new algorithms that allow the molecules to be flexible during docking.",

After behavioral testing was completed, animals were injected with their respective dose of SCH-23390 into the nucleus accumbens (NAc), followed by a systemic injection of the irreversible antagonist N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ). Receptors occupied by intraaccumbens SCH-23390, and therefore protected from EEDQ-induced inactivation, were then quantified from autoradiograms of sections labeled with 3H-SCH-23390. Systemic administration of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg SCH-23390 reversed cocaine-induced locomotion, sniffing, and CPP, suggesting that stimulation of D1-like receptors is necessary for these behavioral changes. Intraaccumbens administration of 1.0 microg/side SCH-23390 reversed cocaine-CPP, and this dose occupied D1-like receptors primarily in the rostral pole of the NAc. Intraaccumbens administration of 0.5 microg/side SCH-23390 reversed cocaine-induced locomotion. However, this dose occupied a similar number of D1-like receptors in the NAc as a lower and behaviorally ineffective dose of 0.1 microg/side, but occupied more receptors in the caudate-putamen relative to both the 0.1 and 1.0 microg/side doses.

Computational design methods have been used to identify optimal locations for functional sites in proteins and design the surrounding residues but have not incorporated unnatural amino acids in this process. We extended the Rosetta design methodology to design metalloproteins in which the amino acid (2,2'-bipyridin-5yl)alanine (Bpy-Ala) is a primary ligand of a bound metal ion. Following initial results that indicated the importance of buttressing the Bpy-Ala amino acid, we designed a buried metal binding site with octahedral coordination geometry consisting of Bpy-Ala, two protein-based metal ligands, and two metal-bound water molecules. Experimental characterization revealed a Bpy-Ala-mediated metalloprotein with the ability to bind divalent cations including Co(2+), Zn(2+), Fe(2+), and Ni(2+), with a Kd for Zn(2+) of ∼40 pM.

Cytoskeletal forces in migrating cells generated by polymerization- or contractility-driven \"retrograde flow\" of F-actin from the cell leading edge have been hypothesized to mediate integrin activation for ligand binding. This predicts that these forces should align and orient activated, ligand-bound integrins at the leading edge. Here, polarization-sensitive fluorescence microscopy of GFP-αVβ3 integrins in fibroblasts shows that integrins are coaligned in a specific orientation within focal adhesions (FAs) in a manner dependent on binding immobilized ligand and a talin-mediated linkage to the F-actin cytoskeleton. These findings, together with Rosetta modeling, suggest that integrins in FA are coaligned and may be highly tilted by cytoskeletal forces. Thus, the F-actin cytoskeleton sculpts an anisotropic molecular scaffold in FAs, and this feature may underlie the ability of migrating cells to sense directional extracellular cues.",

The calculated structures are cross-validated using an independent data set of 691 ssNMR constraints and scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements. The hybrid model resolves the conformation of the non-conserved N terminus, which occupies a protrusion in the cryo-EM density, and reveals conserved pore residues forming a continuous pattern of electrostatic interactions, thereby suggesting a mechanism for effector protein translocation.",

Concerted design for all simultaneous substitutions was more successful than a modular approach against individual substitutions, highlighting the importance of context-dependent redesign and optimization of protein-DNA interactions. We then used computational design based on the crystal structure of the designed complex, which revealed significant unanticipated shifts in DNA conformation, to create an endonuclease that specifically cleaves a site with four contiguous base pair substitutions. Our results demonstrate that specificity switches for multiple concerted base pair substitutions can be computationally designed, and that iteration between design and structure determination provides a route to large scale reprogramming of specificity.",

We show that three-dimensional structures of proteins can reliably be determined using PCS data from a single metal binding site combined with backbone chemical shifts. The program PCS-ROSETTA automatically determines the Δχ-tensor and metal position from the PCS data during the structure calculations, without any prior knowledge of the protein structure.

Parallel experiments on simulated data sets constructed with the overall residue frequencies of proteins but not the inter-residue correlations show that naturally occurring protein sequences are significantly more clustered than the corresponding random sequences for window lengths ranging from one to 13 contiguous positions. The patterns of variation at single positions are not in general surprising: chemically similar amino acids tend to be grouped together. More interesting patterns emerge as the window length increases. The patterns of variation for longer window lengths are in part recognizable patterns of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, and in part less obvious combinations. A particularly interesting class of patterns features highly conserved glycine residues. The patterns provide a means to abstract the information contained in multiple sequence alignments and may be useful for comparison of distantly related sequences or sequence families and for protein structure prediction.",

The barrier reflects an effective increase in the size of the cavity occupied by the expanded but water‐excluding cluster relative to both the close‐packed cluster and the fully solvated separated solutes; a similar effect may contribute to the barrier to protein folding/unfolding. Importantly for the simulation of protein folding without explicit solvent, we find that the interactions between nonpolar solutes of varying size and number can be approximated by a linear function of the molecular surface, but not the solvent‐accessible surface of the solutes.

We show how conservative changes of only one or two amino acids result in dramatic changes in quaternary structure, in which the assemblies can be switched between two very different forms.

A detailed understanding of selectivity in such complexes requires structural information on weak, noncognate complexes which can be difficult to obtain due to their transient and dynamic nature. Using NMR-based docking as a guide, we deployed a disulfide-trapping strategy on a noncognate complex between the colicin E9 endonuclease (E9 DNase) and immunity protein 2 (Im2), which is seven orders of magnitude weaker binding than the cognate femtomolar E9 DNase-Im9 interaction. The 1.77 Å crystal structure of the E9 DNase-Im2 complex reveals an entirely noncovalent interface where the intersubunit disulfide merely supports the crystal lattice. In combination with computational alanine scanning of interfacial residues, the structure reveals that the driving force for binding is so strong that a severely unfavorable specificity contact is tolerated at the interface and as a result the complex becomes weakened through “frustration.” As well as rationalizing past mutational and thermodynamic data, comparing our noncognate structure with previous cognate complexes highlights the importance of loop regions in developing selectivity and accentuates the multiple roles of buried water molecules that stabilize, ameliorate, or aggravate interfacial contacts. The study provides direct support for dual-recognition in colicin DNase-Im protein complexes and shows that weakened noncognate complexes are primed for high-affinity binding, which can be achieved by economical mutation of a limited number of residues at the interface.",

Attempts to model these interactions have generally taken the form of amino acid-base recognition codes or purely sequence-based profile methods, which depend on the availability of extensive sequence and structural information for specific structural families, neglect side-chain conformational variability, and lack generality beyond the structural family used to train the model. Here, we take advantage of recent advances in rotamer-based protein design and the large number of structurally characterized protein-DNA complexes to develop and parameterize a simple physical model for protein-DNA interactions. The model shows considerable promise for redesigning amino acids at protein-DNA interfaces, as design calculations recover the amino acid residue identities and conformations at these interfaces with accuracies comparable to sequence recovery in globular proteins. The model shows promise also for predicting DNA-binding specificity for fixed protein sequences: native DNA sequences are selected correctly from pools of competing DNA substrates; however, incorporation of backbone movement will likely be required to improve performance in homology modeling applications. Interestingly, optimization of zinc finger protein amino acid sequences for high-affinity binding to specific DNA sequences results in proteins with little or no predicted specificity, suggesting that naturally occurring DNA-binding proteins are optimized for specificity rather than affinity. When combined with algorithms that optimize specificity directly, the simple computational model developed here should be useful for the engineering of proteins with novel DNA-binding specificities.",

We sampled a range of EpoR geometries by varying intermonomer angle and distance, corroborated by several ligand-EpoR complex crystal structures. Across the range, we observed full, partial, and biased agonism as well as stage-selective effects on hematopoiesis. This surrogate ligand strategy opens access to pharmacological modulation of therapeutically important cytokine and growth factor receptor systems.",

We used an integrated computational and experimental approach to increase Brevundimonas diminuta phosphotriesterase's (PTE) detoxification rate of V-agents by 5000-fold. Computational models were built of the complex between PTE and V-agents. On the basis of these models, the active site was redesigned to be complementary in shape to VX and RVX and to include favorable electrostatic interactions with their choline-like leaving group. Small libraries based on designed sequences were constructed. The libraries were screened by a direct assay for V-agent detoxification, as our initial studies showed that colorimetric surrogates fail to report the detoxification rates of the actual agents. The experimental results were fed back to improve the computational models. Overall, five rounds of iterating between experiment and model refinement led to variants that hydrolyze the toxic SP isomers of all three V-agents with kcat/KM values of up to 5 × 10(6) M(-1) min(-1) and also efficiently detoxify G-agents.

Most, if not all, of these computational methodologies attempt to model atomic-level interactions, and hence high-resolution structural characterization of the designed proteins is critical for evaluating the atomic-level accuracy of the underlying design force-fields. We previously used our computational protein design protocol RosettaDesign to completely redesign the sequence of the activation domain of human procarboxypeptidase A2. With 68% of the wild-type sequence changed, the designed protein, AYEdesign, is over 10 kcal/mol more stable than the wild-type protein. Here, we describe the high-resolution crystal structure and solution NMR structure of AYEdesign, which show that the experimentally determined backbone and side-chains conformations are effectively superimposable with the computational model at atomic resolution. To isolate the origins of the remarkable stabilization, we have designed and characterized a new series of procarboxypeptidase mutants that gain significant thermodynamic stability with a minimal number of mutations; one mutant gains more than 5 kcal/mol of stability over the wild-type protein with only four amino acid changes. We explore the relationship between force-field smoothing and conformational sampling by comparing the experimentally determined free energies of the overall design and these focused subsets of mutations to those predicted using modified force-fields, and both fixed and flexible backbone sampling protocols.",

An improved version of the method that uses gradient-based minimization for off-rotamer side-chain optimization and includes information from unbound structures was used to create predictions for Rounds 4 and 5 of CAPRI. First, large numbers of independent MCM trajectories were carried out and the lowest free energy docked configurations identified. Second, new trajectories were started from these lowest energy structures to thoroughly sample the surrounding conformation space, and the lowest energy configurations were submitted as predictions. For all cases in which there were no significant backbone conformational changes, a small number of very low-energy configurations were identified in the first, global search and subsequently found to be close to the center of the basin of attraction in the free energy landscape in the second, local search. Following the release of the experimental coordinates, it was found that the centers of these free energy minima were remarkably close to the native structures in not only the rigid-body orientation but also the detailed conformations of the side-chains. Out of 8 targets, the lowest energy models had interface root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) less than 1.1 A from the correct structures for 6 targets, and interface RMSDs less than 0.4 A for 3 targets. The predictions were top submissions to CAPRI for Targets 11, 12, 14, 15, and 19. The close correspondence of the lowest free energy structures found in our searches to the experimental structures suggests that our free energy function is a reasonable representation of the physical chemistry, and that the real space search with full side-chain flexibility to some extent solves the protein-protein docking problem in the absence of significant backbone conformational changes. On the other hand, the approach fails when there are significant backbone conformational changes as the steric complementarity of the 2 proteins cannot be modeled without incorporating backbone flexibility, and this is the major goal of our current work.",

        "abstract": "The evolutionary mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 viruses adapt to mammalian hosts and, potentially, undergo antigenic evolution depend on the ways genetic variation is generated and selected within and between individual hosts. Using domestic cats as a model, we show that SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences remain largely unchanged over time within hosts, while dynamic sub-consensus diversity reveals processes of genetic drift and weak purifying selection. We further identify a notable variant at amino acid position 655 in Spike (H655Y), which was previously shown to confer escape from human monoclonal antibodies. This variant arises rapidly and persists at intermediate frequencies in index cats. It also becomes fixed following transmission in two of three pairs. These dynamics suggest this site may be under positive selection in this system and illustrate how a variant can quickly arise and become fixed in parallel across multiple transmission pairs. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in cats involved a narrow bottleneck, with new infections founded by fewer than ten viruses. In RNA virus evolution, stochastic processes like narrow transmission bottlenecks and genetic drift typically act to constrain the overall pace of adaptive evolution. Our data suggest that here, positive selection in index cats followed by a narrow transmission bottleneck may have instead accelerated the fixation of S H655Y, a potentially beneficial SARS-CoV-2 variant. Overall, our study suggests species- and context-specific adaptations are likely to continue to emerge. This underscores the importance of continued genomic surveillance for new SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as heightened scrutiny for signatures of SARS-CoV-2 positive selection in humans and mammalian model systems.",

Following affinity maturation, a protein designed using this method bound lysozyme with low nanomolar affinity, and a combination of NMR studies, crystallography, and knockout mutagenesis confirmed the designed binding surface and orientation.

Structure predictions with atomic level accuracy have been made for small proteins using the Rosetta structure prediction method, but for larger and more complex proteins, the native state is virtually never sampled, and it has been unclear how much of an increase in computing power would be required to successfully predict the structures of such proteins. In this paper, we develop an approach to determining how much computer power is required to accurately predict the structure of a protein, based on a reformulation of the conformational search problem as a combinatorial sampling problem in a discrete feature space. We find that conformational sampling for many proteins is limited by critical \"linchpin\" features, often the backbone torsion angles of individual residues, which are sampled very rarely in unbiased trajectories and, when constrained, dramatically increase the sampling of the native state. These critical features frequently occur in less regular and likely strained regions of proteins that contribute to protein function. In a number of proteins, the linchpin features are in regions found experimentally to form late in folding, suggesting a correspondence between folding in silico and in reality.",

These trajectories were observed to differ widely from each other. Thus, rather than analyzing individual trajectories, we sought to identify the recurrent features of the high-temperature unfolding process. The conformations from all simulations were combined and then divided into groups based on the number of native contacts. Average occupancies of each side-chain hydrophobic contact and hydrogen bond in the protein were then determined. In the symmetric funnel limit, the occupancies of all contacts should decrease in concert with the loss in total number of native contacts. If there is a lack of symmetry or hierarchy to the unfolding process, the occupancies of some contacts should decrease more slowly, and others more rapidly. Despite the heterogeneity of the individual trajectories, the ensemble averaging revealed an order to the unfolding process: contacts between the N and C-terminal strands are the first to disappear, whereas contacts within the distal beta-hairpin and a hydrogen-bonding network involving the distal loop beta-turn and the diverging turn persist well after the majority of the native contacts are lost. This hierarchy of events resembles but is somewhat less pronounced than that observed in our experimental studies of the folding of src SH3 domain.",

In this work, we develop a scoring function using support vector regression (SVR). Both consensus-based features and features from individual structures are extracted from a training data set containing native protein structures and predicted structural models submitted to CASP5 and CASP6. The SVR learns a scoring function that is a linear combination of these features. We test this scoring function on two data sets. First, when used to rank server models submitted to CASP7, the SVR score selects predictions that are comparable to the best performing server in CASP7, Zhang-Server, and significantly better than all the other servers. Even if the SVR score is not allowed to select Zhang-Server models, the SVR score still selects predictions that are significantly better than all the other servers. In addition, the SVR is able to select significantly better models and yield significantly better Pearson correlation coefficients than the two best Quality Assessment groups in CASP7, QA556 (LEE), and QA634 (Pcons). Second, this work aims to improve the ability of the Robetta server to select best models, and hence we evaluate the performance of the SVR score on ranking the Robetta server template-based models for the CASP7 targets.

Ginzu iteratively assigns domains by homology to structures and sequence families using successively less confident methods. RosettaDOM uses the Rosetta de novo structure prediction method to build three-dimensional models, and then applies Taylor's structure based domain assignment method to parse the models into domains. Domain boundaries observed repeatedly in the models are predicted to be domain boundaries for the protein. Interestingly, RosettaDOM produced quite good domain predictions for proteins of a size typically considered to be beyond the reach of de novo structure prediction methods.

We explored the possibility of systematically designing structured protein-mineral interfaces, guided by the example of ice-binding proteins, which present arrays of threonine residues (matched to the ice lattice) that order clathrate waters into an ice-like structure6. Here we design proteins displaying arrays of up to 54 carboxylate residues geometrically matched to the potassium ion (K+) sublattice on muscovite mica (001). At low K+ concentration, individual molecules bind independently to mica in the designed orientations, whereas at high K+ concentration, the designs form two-dimensional liquid-crystal phases, which accentuate the inherent structural bias in the muscovite lattice to produce protein arrays ordered over tens of millimetres. Incorporation of designed protein-protein interactions preserving the match between the proteins and the K+ lattice led to extended self-assembled structures on mica: designed end-to-end interactions produced micrometre-long single-protein-diameter wires and a designed trimeric interface yielded extensive honeycomb arrays. The nearest-neighbour distances in these hexagonal arrays could be set digitally between 7.5 and 15.9 nanometres with 2.1-nanometre selectivity by changing the number of repeat units in the monomer.

Typically, protein grafting involves the transplantation of protein side chains from a functional motif onto structurally homologous regions of scaffold proteins. Using this approach, we previously transplanted the human immunodeficiency virus 2F5 and 4E10 epitopes onto heterologous proteins to design novel \"epitope-scaffold\" antigens. However, side-chain grafting is limited by the availability of scaffolds with compatible backbone for a given epitope structure and offers no route to modify backbone structure to improve mimicry or binding affinity. To address this, we report here a new and more aggressive computational method-backbone grafting of linear motifs-that transplants the backbone and side chains of linear functional motifs onto scaffold proteins. To test this method, we first used side-chain grafting to design new 2F5 epitope scaffolds with improved biophysical characteristics. We then independently transplanted the 2F5 epitope onto three of the same parent scaffolds using the newly developed backbone grafting procedure. Crystal structures of side-chain and backbone grafting designs showed close agreement with both the computational models and the desired epitope structure. In two cases, backbone grafting scaffolds bound antibody 2F5 with 30- and 9-fold higher affinity than corresponding side-chain grafting designs. These results demonstrate that flexible backbone methods for epitope grafting can significantly improve binding affinities over those achieved by fixed backbone methods alone. Backbone grafting of linear motifs is a general method to transplant functional motifs when backbone remodeling of the target scaffold is necessary.",

Here, we use private data from a real drug discovery program to carry out a blind evaluation of the RosettaLigand docking methodology and find that its performance is on average comparable with that of the best commercially available current small molecule docking programs. The strength of RosettaLigand is the use of the Rosetta sampling methodology to simultaneously optimize protein sidechain, protein backbone and ligand degrees of freedom; the extensive benchmark test described here identifies shortcomings in other aspects of the protocol and suggests clear routes to improving the method.",

FastDesign has been used previously to design novel protein folds and assemblies with important applications in research and medicine. To promote sampling of alternative conformations and sequences, FastDesign includes stages where the energy landscape is smoothened by reducing repulsive forces. Here, we discover that this process disfavors larger amino acids in the protein core because the protein compresses in the early stages of refinement. By testing alternative ramping strategies for the repulsive weight, we arrive at a scheme that produces lower energy designs with more native-like sequence composition in the protein core. We further validate the protocol by designing and experimentally characterizing over 4000 proteins and show that the new protocol produces higher stability proteins.",

        "abstract": "t the discovery of HD 221416 b, the first transiting planet identified by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) for which asteroseismology of the host star is possible. HD 221416 b (HIP 116158, TOI-197) is a bright (V = 8.2 mag), spectroscopically classified subgiant that oscillates with an average frequency of about 430 μHz and displays a clear signature of mixed modes. The oscillation amplitude confirms that the redder TESS bandpass compared to Kepler has a small effect on the oscillations, supporting the expected yield of thousands of solar-like oscillators with TESS 2 minute cadence observations. Asteroseismic modeling yields a robust determination of the host star radius (R⋆ = 2.943 ± 0.064 R⊙), mass (M⋆ = 1.212 ± 0.074 M⊙), and age (4.9 ± 1.1 Gyr), and demonstrates that it has just started ascending the red-giant branch. Combining asteroseismology with transit modeling and radial-velocity observations, we show that the planet is a “hot Saturn” (Rp = 9.17 ± 0.33 R⊕) with an orbital period of ∼14.3 days, irradiance of F = 343 ± 24 F⊕, and moderate mass (Mp = 60.5 ± 5.7 M⊕) and density (ρp = 0.431 ± 0.062 g cm−3). The properties of HD 221416 b show that the host-star metallicity–planet mass correlation found in sub-Saturns (4–8 R⊕) does not extend to larger radii, indicating that planets in the transition between sub-Saturns and Jupiters follow a relatively narrow range of densities. With a density measured to ∼15%, HD 221416 b is one of the best characterized Saturn-size planets to date, augmenting the small number of known transiting planets around evolved stars and demonstrating the power of TESS to characterize exoplanets and their host stars using asteroseismology.",

Most methods for approaching this problem use evolutionary conservation as the primary indicator of the location of functional sites. However, sequence conservation reflects not only evolutionary selection at functional sites to maintain protein function, but also selection throughout the protein to maintain the stability of the folded state. To disentangle sequence conservation due to protein functional constraints from sequence conservation due to protein structural constraints, we use all atom computational protein design methodology to predict sequence profiles expected under solely structural constraints, and to compute the free energy difference between the naturally occurring amino acid and the lowest free energy amino acid at each position. We show that functional sites are more likely than non-functional sites to have computed sequence profiles which differ significantly from the naturally occurring sequence profiles and to have residues with sub-optimal free energies, and that incorporation of these two measures improves sequence based prediction of protein functional sites. The combined sequence and structure based functional site prediction method has been implemented in a publicly available web server.",

Here we extend our earlier model of folding free energy landscapes, in which each residue is considered to be either folded as in the native state or completely disordered, by investigating the role of additional factors representing hydrogen bonding and backbone torsion strain, and by using a hybrid between the master equation approach and the simple transition state theory to evaluate kinetics near the free energy barrier in greater detail. Model calculations of folding phi-values are compared to experimental data for 19 proteins, and for more than half of these, experimental data are reproduced with correlation coefficients between r=0.41 and 0.88; calculations of transition state free energy barriers correlate with rates measured for 37 single domain proteins (r=0.69). The model provides insight into the contribution of alternative-folding pathways, the validity of quasi-equilibrium treatments of the folding landscape, and the magnitude of the Arrhenius prefactor for protein folding. Finally, we discuss the limitations of simple native-state-based models, and as a more general test of such models, provide predictions of folding rates and mechanisms for a comprehensive set of over 400 small protein domains of known structure.",

        "abstract": "We use mass spectrometry in conjunction with hydrogen-deuterium exchange and NMR to characterize the conformational dynamics of the 62-residue IgG binding domain of protein L under conditions in which the native state is marginally stable. Mass spectra of protein L after short incubations in D2O reveal the presence of two distinct populations containing different numbers of protected protons. NMR experiments indicate that protons in the hydrophobic core are protected in one population, whereas all protons are exchanged for deuterons in the other. As the exchange period is increased, molecules are transferred from the former population to the latter. The absence of molecules with a subset of the core protons protected suggests that exchange occurs in part via a highly concerted transition to an excited state in which all protons exchange rapidly with deuterons. A steady increase in the molecular weight of the population with protected protons, and variation in the exchange rates of the individual protected protons indicates the presence of an additional exchange mechanism. A simple model in which exchange results from rapid (> 10(5)/s) local fluctuations around the native state superimposed upon transitions to an unfolded excited state at approximately 0.06/s is supported by qualitative agreement between the observed mass spectra and the mass spectra simulated according to the model using NMR-derived estimates of the proton exchange rates.",

Predicting any protein's accurate structure is of paramount importance for the scientific community, as these structures govern their function. Moreover, this is one of the complicated optimization problems that computational biologists have ever faced. Experimental protein structure determination methods include X-ray crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Electron Microscopy. All of these are tedious and time-consuming procedures that require expertise. To make the process less cumbersome, scientists use predictive tools as part of computational methods, using data consolidated in the protein repositories. In recent years, machine learning approaches have raised the interest of the structure prediction community. Most of the machine learning approaches for protein structure prediction are centred on co-evolution based methods. The accuracy of these approaches depends on the number of homologous protein sequences available in the databases. The prediction problem becomes challenging for many proteins, especially those without enough sequence homologs. Deep learning methods allow for the extraction of intricate features from protein sequence data without making any intuitions. Accurately predicted protein structures are employed for drug discovery, antibody designs, understanding protein-protein interactions, and interactions with other molecules. This article provides a review of conventional and deep learning approaches in protein structure prediction. We conclude this review by outlining a few publicly available datasets and deep learning architectures currently employed for protein structure prediction tasks.",

The recent determination of the crystal structure of an initiation complex provided insight into the initiation step of pilus biogenesis resulting in pore activation, but very little is known about the elongation steps that follow. Here, to address this question, we determine the structure of an elongation complex in which the tip complex assembly composed of FimC, FimF, FimG and FimH passes through FimD. This structure demonstrates the conformational changes required to prevent backsliding of the nascent pilus through the FimD pore and also reveals unexpected properties of the usher pore. We show that the circular binding interface between the pore lumen and the folded substrate participates in transport by defining a low-energy pathway along which the nascent pilus polymer is guided during secretion.",

        "abstract": "Enzymes use substrate-binding energy both to promote ground-state association and to stabilize the reaction transition state selectively. The monomeric homing endonuclease I-AniI cleaves with high sequence specificity in the centre of a 20-base-pair (bp) DNA target site, with the amino (N)-terminal domain of the enzyme making extensive binding interactions with the left (-) side of the target site and the similarly structured carboxy (C)-terminal domain interacting with the right (+) side. Here we show that, despite the approximate twofold symmetry of the enzyme-DNA complex, there is almost complete segregation of interactions responsible for substrate binding to the (-) side of the interface and interactions responsible for transition-state stabilization to the (+) side. Although single base-pair substitutions throughout the entire DNA target site reduce catalytic efficiency, mutations in the (-) DNA half-site almost exclusively increase the dissociation constant (K(D)) and the Michaelis constant under single-turnover conditions (K(M)*), and those in the (+) half-site primarily decrease the turnover number (k(cat)*). The reduction of activity produced by mutations on the (-) side, but not mutations on the (+) side, can be suppressed by tethering the substrate to the endonuclease displayed on the surface of yeast. This dramatic asymmetry in the use of enzyme-substrate binding energy for catalysis has direct relevance to the redesign of endonucleases to cleave genomic target sites for gene therapy and other applications. Computationally redesigned enzymes that achieve new specificities on the (-) side do so by modulating K(M)*, whereas redesigns with altered specificities on the (+) side modulate k(cat)*. Our results illustrate how classical enzymology and modern protein design can each inform the other.",

        "abstract": "This review contains the proceedings from a symposium held at the RSA conference in 2003 on \"Alcohol Withdrawal and Conditioning.\" The presentations covered a range of interactions between conditioning and alcohol withdrawal, in both animal behavior and the clinic. Dr. D.N. Stephens first described his studies exploring the consequences of alcohol dependence and repeated experience of withdrawal on the conditioning process. His data suggested that repeated withdrawal from moderate alcohol intake impairs amygdala-dependent mechanisms for learning about aversive events. Dr. H. Becker then detailed studies examining the consequences of repeated ethanol withdrawal experience on subsequent ethanol drinking behavior in mice, and conditions in which motivational properties of odor cues that are associated with different phases of ethanol withdrawal influence such relapse behavior. The data suggested that cues associated with acute withdrawal or \"recovery\" from withdrawal may serve as modulating factors in influencing subsequent ethanol drinking behavior, and that the timing of the cues determines their consequences. Dr. F. Weiss described recent findings from animal models of relapse that suggested the efficacy of alcohol-associated contextual stimuli in eliciting alcohol-seeking behavior resembles the endurance of conditioned cue reactivity and cue-induced cocaine craving in humans. The interactive effects of stress and ethanol-related environmental stimuli were found to be dependent on concurrent activation of endogenous opioid and corticotropin-releasing factor systems. Conditioning factors (i.e., exposure to drug-associated stimuli) and stress could therefore interact to augment vulnerability to relapse. Dr. C. Drummond then addressed the clinical aspects of conditioning during alcohol withdrawal and described studies showing exposure of alcoholics to alcohol-related cues elicited greater subjective and physiological responses than exposure to neutral cues. The former responsivity showed a relationship with a measure of motivation to drink alcohol. Finally, Dr. C. Cunningham provided a summary of the concepts involved in the presentations and discussed the conditioning processes that affect behavior during and after alcohol withdrawal.",

DNA replication commences approximately halfway through the intracellular development following invasion and parasite growth. The schizont stage is associated with multiple rounds of DNA replication and nuclear division without cytokinesis, resulting in a multinucleated cell. Nuclei divide asynchronously through schizogony, with only the final round of DNA replication and segregation being synchronous and coordinated with daughter cell assembly2,3. However, the control mechanisms for this divergent mode of replication are unknown. Here, we show that the Plasmodium-specific kinase PfCRK4 is a key cell-cycle regulator that orchestrates multiple rounds of DNA replication throughout schizogony in Plasmodium falciparum. PfCRK4 depletion led to a complete block in nuclear division and profoundly inhibited DNA replication. Quantitative phosphoproteomic profiling identified a set of PfCRK4-regulated phosphoproteins with greatest functional similarity to CDK2 substrates, particularly proteins involved in the origin of replication firing. PfCRK4 was required for initial and subsequent rounds of DNA replication during schizogony and, in addition, was essential for development in the mosquito vector. Our results identified an essential S-phase promoting factor of the unconventional P. falciparum cell cycle. PfCRK4 is required for both a prolonged period of the intraerythrocytic stage of Plasmodium infection, as well as for transmission, revealing a broad window for PfCRK4-targeted chemotherapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Investment in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequencing in Africa over the past year has led to a major increase in the number of sequences that have been generated and used to track the pandemic on the continent, a number that now exceeds 100,000 genomes. Our results show an increase in the number of African countries that are able to sequence domestically and highlight that local sequencing enables faster turnaround times and more-regular routine surveillance. Despite limitations of low testing proportions, findings from this genomic surveillance study underscore the heterogeneous nature of the pandemic and illuminate the distinct dispersal dynamics of variants of concern-particularly Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron-on the continent. Sustained investment for diagnostics and genomic surveillance in Africa is needed as the virus continues to evolve while the continent faces many emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats. These investments are crucial for pandemic preparedness and response and will serve the health of the continent well into the 21st century.",

        "abstract": "envelope glycoproteins (Env) gp120 and gp41 mediate entry and are the targets for neutralizing antibodies. Within gp41, a continuous epitope defined by the broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5, is one of the few conserved sites accessible to antibodies on the functional HIV Env spike. Recently, as an initial attempt at structure-guided design, we transplanted the 2F5 epitope onto several non-HIV acceptor scaffold proteins that we termed epitope scaffolds (ES). As immunogens, these ES proteins elicited antibodies with exquisite binding specificity matching that of the 2F5 antibody. These novel 2F5 epitope scaffolds presented us with the opportunity to test heterologous prime∶boost immunization strategies to selectively boost antibody responses against the engrafted gp41 2F5 epitope. Such strategies might be employed to target conserved but poorly immunogenic sites on the HIV-1 Env, and, more generally, other structurally defined pathogen targets. Here, we assessed ES prime∶boosting by measuring epitope specific serum antibody titers by ELISA and B cell responses by ELISpot analysis using both free 2F5 peptide and an unrelated ES protein as probes. We found that the heterologous ES prime∶boosting immunization regimen elicits cross-reactive humoral responses to the structurally constrained 2F5 epitope target, and that incorporating a promiscuous T cell helper epitope in the immunogens resulted in higher antibody titers against the 2F5 graft, but did not result in virus neutralization. Interestingly, two epitope scaffolds (ES1 and ES2), which did not elicit a detectable 2F5 epitope-specific response on their own, boosted such responses when primed with the ES5. Together, these results indicate that heterologous ES prime∶boost immunization regimens effectively focus the humoral immune response on the structurally defined and immunogen-conserved HIV-1 2F5 epitope.",

        "abstract": "We have investigated recently reported computationally designed retroaldolase enzymes with the goal of understanding the extent and the origins of their catalytic power. Direct comparison of the designed enzymes to primary amine catalysts in solution revealed a rate acceleration of 10(5)-fold for the most active of the designed retroaldolases. Through pH-rate studies of the designed retroaldolases and evaluation of a Brønsted correlation for a series of amine catalysts, we found that lysine pK(a) values are shifted by 3-4 units in the enzymes but that the catalytic contributions from the shifted pK(a) values are estimated to be modest, about 10-fold. For the most active of the reported enzymes, we evaluated the catalytic contribution of two other design components: a motif intended to stabilize a bound water molecule and hydrophobic substrate binding interactions. Mutational analysis suggested that the bound water motif does not contribute to the rate acceleration. Comparison of the rate acceleration of the designed substrate relative to a minimal substrate suggested that hydrophobic substrate binding interactions contribute around 10(3)-fold to the enzymatic rate acceleration. Altogether, these results suggest that substrate binding interactions and shifting the pK(a) of the catalytic lysine can account for much of the enzyme's rate acceleration. Additional observations suggest that these interactions are limited in the specificity of placement of substrate and active site catalytic groups. Thus, future design efforts may benefit from a focus on achieving precision in binding interactions and placement of catalytic groups.",

In conjunction with the design process, extensive computational analyses were carried out to evaluate the potential performance of four of the designs, as presented here. The enzyme-catalyzed reactions were modeled using mixed quantum and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations in the context of Monte Carlo (MC) statistical mechanics simulations. Free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations were used to characterize the free-energy surfaces for the catalyzed reactions as well as for reference processes in water. The simulations yielded detailed information about the catalytic mechanisms, activation barriers, and structural evolution of the active sites over the course of the reactions. The catalytic mechanism for the designed enzymes KE07, KE10(V131N), and KE15 was found to be concerted with proton transfer, generally more advanced in the transition state than breaking of the isoxazolyl N-O bond. On the basis of the free-energy results, all three enzymes were anticipated to be active. Ideas for further improvement of the enzyme designs also emerged. On the technical side, the synergy of parallel QM/MM and experimental efforts in the design of artificial enzymes is well illustrated.",

These combinatorial mutants as well as strategically placed point mutants in the two turns had a similar range of thermodynamic stabilities, but strikingly different folding kinetics. A glycine to alanine substitution in the second beta-turn increased the rate of unfolding more than tenfold but had little effect on the rate of folding, while mutation of a symmetrically disposed glycine residue in the first turn had little effect on unfolding but slowed the rate of folding nearly tenfold.

Here we identify the C-terminal domain of the gE ectodomain (CgE) as the minimal Fc-binding domain and present a 1.78-angstroms CgE structure. A 5-angstroms gE-gI/Fc crystal structure, which was independently verified by a theoretical prediction method, reveals that CgE binds Fc at the C(H)2-C(H)3 interface, the binding site for several mammalian and bacterial Fc-binding proteins. The structure identifies interface histidines that may confer pH-dependent binding and regions of CgE implicated in cell-to-cell spread of virus.

Here we describe the application of Rosetta Design for the genetic optimization of an artificial transfer hydrogenase (ATHase hereafter), [(η(5)-Cp*)Ir(pico)Cl] ⊂ WT hCA II (Cp* = Me5C5(-)), for the asymmetric reduction of a cyclic imine, the precursor of salsolsidine. Based on a crystal structure of the ATHase, computational design afforded four hCAII variants with protein backbone-stabilizing and hydrophobic cofactor-embedding mutations. In dansylamide-competition assays, these designs showed 46-64-fold improved affinity for the iridium pianostool complex [(η(5)-Cp*)Ir(pico)Cl]. Gratifyingly, the new designs yielded a significant improvement in both activity and enantioselectivity (from 70% ee (WT hCA II) to up to 92% ee and a 4-fold increase in total turnover number) for the production of (S)-salsolidine. Introducing additional hydrophobicity in the Cp*-moiety of the Ir-catalyst provided by adding a propyl substituent on the Cp* moiety yields the most (S)-selective (96% ee) ATHase reported to date. X-ray structural data indicate that the high enantioselectivity results from embedding the piano stool moiety within the protein, consistent with the computational model.",

Here, we interrogated >50 RAD51C missense variants, finding that mutations in residues conserved with RAD51 strongly predicted HR deficiency and disrupted interactions with other RAD51 paralogs. A cluster of mutations was identified in and around the Walker A box that led to impairments in HR, interactions with three other RAD51 paralogs, binding to single-stranded DNA, and ATP hydrolysis. We generated structural models of the two RAD51 paralog complexes containing RAD51C, RAD51B-RAD51C-RAD51D-XRCC2 and RAD51C-XRCC3.

Ovarian cancer patients with variants in this cluster showed exceptionally long survival, which may be relevant to the reversion potential of the variants.

First, the phage selection procedure strongly selects against a point mutation in protein L that disrupts folding but is not in the IgG binding interface. Second, variants recovered from a library in which the first third of protein L was randomized are properly folded. The degree of sequence variation in the selected population is striking: the variants have as many as nine substitutions in the 14 residues that were mutagenized. The approach provides a selection for \"foldedness\" that is potentially applicable to any small binding protein.",

The conformational heterogeneity and partially folded nature of most of these states has rendered their characterization by high-resolution structural approaches difficult or even intractable. Here we introduce a method to rapidly infer the tertiary helical arrangements of large RNA molecules in their native and non-native solution states. Multiplexed hydroxyl radical (.OH) cleavage analysis (MOHCA) enables the high-throughput detection of numerous pairs of contacting residues via random incorporation of radical cleavage agents followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We validated this technology by recapitulating the unfolded and native states of a well studied model RNA, the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena ribozyme, at subhelical resolution. We then applied MOHCA to a recently discovered third state of the P4-P6 RNA that is stabilized by high concentrations of monovalent salt and whose partial order precludes conventional techniques for structure determination. The three-dimensional portrait of a compact, non-native RNA state reveals a well ordered subset of native tertiary contacts, in contrast to the dynamic but otherwise similar molten globule states of proteins. With its applicability to nearly any solution state, we expect MOHCA to be a powerful tool for illuminating the many functional structures of large RNA molecules and RNA/protein complexes.",

Thus, incentives for removing various elements from the waste were greatly increased. Also, incentives were greatly overestimated by neglecting all short-term risks and by assuming that elements removed from the waste could be eliminated from the earth without risk. Despite these conservative assumptions, the study found that for reasonable isolation conditions, the potential incremental radiation doses would be of the same order as or less than doses from natural sources. Although not a comprehensive evaluation or partitioning incentives, the study does show that incentives for removal of any elements, including the transuranics, from high-level waste do not exist for the situations investigated.

Because activity gradually diminishes to normal levels with repeated testing, it has been argued that this behavior represents a reversible or transient effect of ischemia. The present study challenged this notion by testing ischemic gerbils at a time when increased activity is not observed with repeated testing. Ischemic (5-min bilateral carotid occlusion) and sham gerbils were tested for 14 consecutive days after reperfusion in an open-field apparatus (n = 6/condition). As previously reported, ischemic gerbils exhibited a significant increase in activity (days 1 and 2) which returned to control levels with repeated testing (days 13 and 14). A second group of ischemic and sham gerbils (n = 6/condition) were tested only on days 13 and 14 after reperfusion. In contrast to those tested repeatedly, these ischemic gerbils displayed increased locomotor activity as compared with sham controls. In addition, gerbils in the repeated testing conditions were evaluated in a semi-novel testing environment on days 15 and 16 after surgery. The locomotor activity of ischemic gerbils significantly increased in response to the semi-novel environment. These results suggest that the effects of ischemia on locomotor activity are not limited to a brief period after occlusion and may represent a permanent deficit. In addition, as previously suggested, this behavior may represent a deficit in habituation or spatial mapping rather than motor hyperactivity.",

We find that three of the four redesigned proteins fold much faster than their naturally occurring counterparts. While natural selection thus does not appear to operate on protein folding rates, the majority of the designed proteins unfold considerably faster than their naturally occurring counterparts, suggesting possible selection for a high free energy barrier to unfolding. In contrast to almost all naturally occurring proteins of less than 100 residues but consistent with simple computational models, the folding energy landscape for Top7 appears to be quite complex, suggesting the smooth energy landscapes and highly cooperative folding transitions observed for small naturally occurring proteins may also reflect the workings of natural selection.",

Signals received at the cell surface are relayed into the nucleus, where MAPK phosphorylates and thereby modulates the activities of a subset of transcription factors. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a new component of this signal transduction pathway called Mae (for modulator of the activity of Ets). Mae is a signalling intermediate that directly links the MAPK signalling pathway to its downstream transcription factor targets. Phosphorylation by MAPK of the critical serine residue (Ser 127) of the Drosophila transcription factor Yan depends on Mae, and is mediated by the binding of Yan to Mae through their Pointed domains. This phosphorylation is both necessary and sufficient to abrogate transcriptional repression by Yan. Mae also regulates the activity of the transcriptional activator Pointed-P2 by a similar mechanism. Mae is essential for the normal development and viability of Drosophila, and is required in vivo for normal signalling of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Our study indicates that MAPK signalling specificity may depend on proteins that couple specific substrates to the kinase.",

Recently, we have demonstrated that the transition state, dictating folding kinetics, is characterized as the state of maximum dynamic cooperativity, i.e., the state of maximum correlations between amino acid contact formations. Here, we investigate the evolutionary conservation of those amino acids contributing significantly to the dynamic cooperativity. We find a strong indication of a new kind of relationship-necessary but not sufficient causality-between the evolutionary conservation and the dynamic cooperativity: larger contributions to the dynamic cooperativity arise from more conserved residues, but not vice versa. This holds for all the protein systems for which long folding simulation trajectories are available. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic demonstration of any kind of evolutionary conservation of amino acids relevant to folding kinetics.",

        "abstract": "Sex is an obligate step in the life cycle of the malaria parasite and occurs in the midgut of the mosquito vector. With both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium berghei, the tryptophan metabolite xanthurenic acid induces the release of motile male gametes from red blood cells (exflagellation), a prerequisite for fertilization. The addition of cGMP or phosphodiesterase inhibitors to cultures of mature gametocytes has also been shown to stimulate exflagellation. Here, we demonstrate that there is a guanylyl cyclase activity associated with mature P. falciparum gametocyte membrane preparations, which is dependent on the presence of Mg(2+)/Mn(2+) but is inhibited by Ca(2+). Significantly, this activity is increased on addition of xanthurenic acid. In contrast, a xanthurenic acid precursor (3-hydroxykynurenine), which is not an inducer of exflagellation, does not induce this guanylyl cyclase activity. These results therefore suggest that xanthurenic acid-induced exflagellation may be mediated by activation of the parasite cGMP signalling pathway.",

Though growing evidence suggests that novel variants arise during prolonged infections, most infections are acute. Understanding how efficiently variants emerge and transmit among acutely-infected hosts is therefore critical for predicting the pace of long-term SARS-CoV-2 evolution. To characterize how within-host diversity is generated and propagated, we combine extensive laboratory and bioinformatic controls with metrics of within- and between-host diversity to 133 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from acutely-infected individuals. We find that within-host diversity is low and transmission bottlenecks are narrow, with very few viruses founding most infections. Within-host variants are rarely transmitted, even among individuals within the same household, and are rarely detected along phylogenetically linked infections in the broader community. These findings suggest that most variation generated within-host is lost during transmission.",

The core of these interactions is increasingly known, but novel interactions continue to be discovered, and the information remains scattered across different database resources, experimental modalities and levels of mechanistic detail. The STRING database (https://string-db.org/) systematically collects and integrates protein-protein interactions-both physical interactions as well as functional associations. The data originate from a number of sources: automated text mining of the scientific literature, computational interaction predictions from co-expression, conserved genomic context, databases of interaction experiments and known complexes/pathways from curated sources. All of these interactions are critically assessed, scored, and subsequently automatically transferred to less well-studied organisms using hierarchical orthology information. The data can be accessed via the website, but also programmatically and via bulk downloads. The most recent developments in STRING (version 12.0) are: (i) it is now possible to create, browse and analyze a full interaction network for any novel genome of interest, by submitting its complement of encoded proteins, (ii) the co-expression channel now uses variational auto-encoders to predict interactions, and it covers two new sources, single-cell RNA-seq and experimental proteomics data and (iii) the confidence in each experimentally derived interaction is now estimated based on the detection method used, and communicated to the user in the web-interface. Furthermore, STRING continues to enhance its facilities for functional enrichment analysis, which are now fully available also for user-submitted genomes.",

We design proteins with idealized serine-containing catalytic triads and assess their nucleophilicity directly in native biological systems using activity-based organophosphate probes. Crystal structures of the most successful designs show unprecedented agreement with computational models, including extensive hydrogen bonding networks between the catalytic triad (or quartet) residues, and mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that these networks are critical for serine activation and organophosphate reactivity. Following optimization by yeast display, the designs react with organophosphate probes at rates comparable to natural serine hydrolases.

The experimental data serve to guide the search for the lowest energy state towards the deep minimum at the native state which is frequently missed in Rosetta de novo structure calculations. However, as the protein size increases, sampling again becomes limiting; for example, the standard Rosetta protocol involving Monte Carlo fragment insertion starting from an extended chain fails to converge for proteins over 150 amino acids even with guidance from chemical shifts (CS-Rosetta) and other NMR data. The primary limitation of this protocol--that every folding trajectory is completely independent of every other--was recently overcome with the development of a new approach involving resolution-adapted structural recombination (RASREC). Here we describe the RASREC approach in detail and compare it to standard CS-Rosetta. We show that the improved sampling of RASREC is essential in obtaining accurate structures over a benchmark set of 11 proteins in the 15-25 kDa size range using chemical shifts, backbone RDCs and HN-HN NOE data; in a number of cases the improved sampling methodology makes a larger contribution than incorporation of additional experimental data. Experimental data are invaluable for guiding sampling to the vicinity of the global energy minimum, but for larger proteins, the standard Rosetta fold-from-extended-chain protocol does not converge on the native minimum even with experimental data and the more powerful RASREC approach is necessary to converge to accurate solutions.",

However, amino acids that are enzymatically important and present in the C2 domain of mammalian adenylyl cyclases are located in the C1 domain of the P. falciparum proteins and vice versa. In addition, certain key residues in these domains are more characteristic of guanylyl cyclases. Consistent with this, guanylyl cyclase activity was obtained following expression of the catalytic domains of PfGCbeta in Escherichia coli. In P. falciparum, expression of both genes was detectable in the sexual but not the asexual blood stages of the life cycle, and PfGCalpha was localized to the parasite/parasitophorous vacuole membrane region of gametocytes.

Enzymes known as sulphydryl oxidases catalyse de novo disulphide formation and initiate intra- and intermolecular dithiol/disulphide relays to deliver the disulphides to substrate proteins. Quiescin sulphydryl oxidase (QSOX) is a unique, multi-domain disulphide catalyst that is localized primarily to the Golgi apparatus and secreted fluids and has attracted attention owing to its overproduction in tumours. In addition to its physiological importance, QSOX is a mechanistically intriguing enzyme, encompassing functions typically carried out by a series of proteins in other disulphide-formation pathways. How disulphides are relayed through the multiple redox-active sites of QSOX and whether there is a functional benefit to concatenating these sites on a single polypeptide are open questions. Here we present the first crystal structure of an intact QSOX enzyme, derived from a trypanosome parasite. Notably, sequential sites in the disulphide relay were found more than 40 Å apart in this structure, too far for direct disulphide transfer. To resolve this puzzle, we trapped and crystallized an intermediate in the disulphide hand-off, which showed a 165° domain rotation relative to the original structure, bringing the two active sites within disulphide-bonding distance. The comparable structure of a mammalian QSOX enzyme, also presented here, shows further biochemical features that facilitate disulphide transfer in metazoan orthologues. Finally, we quantified the contribution of concatenation to QSOX activity, providing general lessons for the understanding of multi-domain enzymes and the design of new catalytic relays.",

A current limitation of this pathway is the restricted product profile, which consists of n-alkanes of 13, 15, and 17 carbons in length. To expand the product profile, we incorporated a new part, FabH2 from Bacillus subtilis , an enzyme known to have a broader specificity profile for fatty acid initiation than the native FabH of Escherichia coli . When provided with the appropriate substrate, the addition of FabH2 resulted in an altered alkane product profile in which significant levels of n-alkanes of 14 and 16 carbons in length are produced. The production of even chain length alkanes represents initial steps toward the expansion of this recently discovered microbial alkane production pathway to synthesize complex fuels.

After clustering the resulting trajectories into conformational families, the average molecular mechanics--Poisson Boltzmann/surface area (MM-PBSA) free energies and alpha carbon (C(alpha)) RMSDs were then calculated for each family. Those conformational families with the lowest average free energies also contained the best C(alpha) RMSD structures (1.4 A for S15 and HP-36 core) and the lowest average C(alpha) RMSDs (1.8 A for S15, 2.1 A for HP-36 core). For comparison, control simulations starting with the two experimental structures were very stable, each consisting of a single conformational family, with an average C(alpha) RMSD of 1.3 A for S15 and 1.2 A for HP-36 core (1.9 A over all residues).

        "abstract": "Abundant and essential motifs, such as phosphate-binding loops (P-loops), are presumed to be the seeds of modern enzymes. The Walker-A P-loop is absolutely essential in modern NTPase enzymes, in mediating binding, and transfer of the terminal phosphate groups of NTPs. However, NTPase function depends on many additional active-site residues placed throughout the protein's scaffold. Can motifs such as P-loops confer function in a simpler context? We applied a phylogenetic analysis that yielded a sequence logo of the putative ancestral Walker-A P-loop element: a β-strand connected to an α-helix via the P-loop. Computational design incorporated this element into de novo designed β-α repeat proteins with relatively few sequence modifications. We obtained soluble, stable proteins that unlike modern P-loop NTPases bound ATP in a magnesium-independent manner. Foremost, these simple P-loop proteins avidly bound polynucleotides, RNA, and single-strand DNA, and mutations in the P-loop's key residues abolished binding. Binding appears to be facilitated by the structural plasticity of these proteins, including quaternary structure polymorphism that promotes a combined action of multiple P-loops. Accordingly, oligomerization enabled a 55-aa protein carrying a single P-loop to confer avid polynucleotide binding. Overall, our results show that the P-loop Walker-A motif can be implemented in small and simple β-α repeat proteins, primarily as a polynucleotide binding motif.",

Biofilm characteristics were determined by scanning electron microscopy. L. monocytogenes produced well-formed biofilms within 24 h at 37 °C on coupon surfaces. Treating Listeria-laden biofilms with the CE isolates individually at either 4 or 8 °C for 3 weeks substantially reduced or eliminated listeriae in the biofilms.

We evaluated the efficacy of these isolates for reducing Listeria spp. contamination of floor drains of a plant in which fresh poultry is processed. Baseline assays revealed that the mean numbers of Listeria sp. cells in floor drains sampled on six different dates (at approximately biweekly intervals) were 7.5 log(10) CFU/100 cm(2) for drain 8, 4.9 log(10) CFU/100 cm(2) for drain 3, 4.4 log(10) CFU/100 cm(2) for drain 2, 4.1 log(10) CFU/100 cm(2) for drain 4, 3.7 log(10) CFU/100 cm(2) for drain 1, and 3.6 log(10) CFU/100 cm(2) for drain 6. The drains were then treated with 10(7) CE/ml in an enzyme-foam-based cleaning agent four times in 1 week and twice a week for the following 3 weeks. In samples collected 1 week after CE treatments were applied Listeria sp. cells were not detectable (samples were negative as determined by selective enrichment culture) for drains 4 and 6 (reductions of 4.1 and 3.6 log(10) CFU/100 cm(2), respectively), and the mean numbers of Listeria sp. cells were 3.7 log(10) CFU/100 cm(2) for drain 8 (a reduction of 3.8 log(10) CFU/100 cm(2)), <1.7 log(10) CFU/100 cm(2) for drain 1 (detectable only by selective enrichment culture; a reduction of 3.3 log(10) CFU/100 cm(2)), and 2.6 log(10) CFU/100 cm(2) for drain 3 (a reduction of 2.3 log(10) CFU/100 cm(2)). However, the aerobic plate counts for samples collected from floor drains before, during, and after CE treatment remained approximately the same.

        "abstract": "We report the characterization of an unusual adenylyl cyclase gene from Plasmodium falciparum, here designated PfACalpha. The level of mRNA expression is maximum during development of gametocytes (the sexual blood stage of the parasite life cycle). The gene is highly interrupted by 22 introns, and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed that there are multiple mRNA splice variants. One intron has three alternative 3'-splice sites that confer the potential to encode distinct forms of the enzyme using alternative start codons. Deduced amino acid sequences predict membrane-spanning regions, the number of which can vary between two and six depending on the splice variant. Expression of a synthetic form of two of these variants in Xenopus oocytes and in Dictyostelium adenylyl cyclase-deficient mutants, confirms that PfACalpha is a functional adenylyl cyclase. These results identify a novel mechanism in P. falciparum for the generation of multiple isoforms of a key, membrane-bound signaling molecule from a single genomic copy. Comparisons of the catalytic domains of PfACalpha and a second putative P. falciparum adenylyl cyclase (PfACbeta) with those from other species reveal an unexpected similarity with adenylyl cyclases from certain prokaryotes including the cyanobacteria (blue green algae). In addition, the presence of an unusual active site substitution in a position that determines substrate specificity, also characteristic of these prokaryotic forms of the enzyme, further suggests a plastid origin for the Plasmodium cyclases.",

        "abstract": "The var genes encode Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) proteins, a set of highly diverse surface-expressed proteins that mediate adhesion of erythrocytes infected with asexual blood-stage parasites to host endothelium. Switching among expressed PfEMP1 variants in the course of a blood-stage infection is a key component of antigenic variation, and thus immune evasion, by the parasite. The majority of var loci are found in the subtelomeric regions of P. falciparum chromosomes associated with members of other multigene families, including stevor. Both PfEMP1 and STEVOR are expressed in gametocytes, the transmissible parasite stage, but the role of these proteins in the biology of sexual-stage parasites remains unknown. PfEMP1 may continue to mediate antigenic variation in gametocytes, which need to persist in the host for many days before reaching maturity. Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and Northern hybridization, we demonstrate that transcription of a defined subset of type C var loci occurs during gametocyte development in vitro. This transcriptional program occurs in gametocytes regardless of the var expression phenotype of their asexual progenitors and therefore is subject to regulatory processes distinct from those that manage antigenic variation in the asexual parasite. In contrast, the same stevor variants are transcribed in both gametocytes and their asexual progenitors. We also provide evidence that for both asexual parasites and gametocytes, var and stevor transcription patterns are not linked to each other.",

On 1 day, animals received an injection of one of eight doses of 7-OH-DPAT (0-5 mg/kg) and were placed into a distinct compartment for 40 min. On the other day, animals received an injection of saline and were placed into a different compartment for 40 min. Locomotion, sniffing, and yawning were measured following the first and last injection of 7-OH-DPAT. Place conditioning was assessed on the day following the last trial. 7-OH-DPAT produced a U-shaped dose-dependent change in locomotion and sniffing, and an inverted U-shaped dose-dependent change in yawning. Additionally, repeated administration of 0.1 mg/kg sensitized yawning, whereas 5 mg/kg sensitized locomotion. None of the doses of 7-OH-DPAT produced conditioned place preference, however, there was a trend for conditioned place aversion at 0.03 mg/kg. By contrast, LiCl (127 mg/kg) produced conditioned place aversion and amphetamine (1 mg/kg) produced conditioned place preference using the same conditioning parameters. A subsequent experiment in which the number of animals and conditioning trials were increased demonstrated that the 0.03 mg/kg dose of 7-OH-DPAT produced conditioned place aversion. 7-OH-DPAT has a higher affinity for D3 receptors relative to D2 receptors. Therefore, it is suggested that intermediate doses (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) that increase yawning, and decrease locomotion and sniffing, may preferentially occupy D3 receptors. Furthermore, the results suggest that these putative D3-preferring doses have weak aversive effects.",

Using induced chromosomal translocation to pair barcodes representing binding proteins, thousands of distinct interactions can be screened in a single pot.

Results: We have developed a structural model of hZIP4 by combining protein prediction methods with in situ experiments. Conclusion: Analysis of our experiments provides insight into the permeation pathway of hZIP4. Significance: Comparison of this model to membrane transporter crystal structures provides a structural linkage to MFS proteins. Members of the Zrt and Irt protein (ZIP) family are a central participant in transition metal homeostasis as they function to increase the cytosolic concentration of zinc and/or iron. However, the lack of a crystal structure hinders elucidation of the molecular mechanism of ZIP proteins. Here, we employed GREMLIN, a co-evolution-based contact prediction approach in conjunction with the Rosetta structure prediction program to construct a structural model of the human (h) ZIP4 transporter. The predicted contact data are best fit by modeling hZIP4 as a dimer. Mutagenesis of residues that comprise a central putative hZIP4 transmembrane transition metal coordination site in the structural model alter the kinetics and specificity of hZIP4. Comparison of the hZIP4 dimer model to all known membrane protein structures identifies the 12-transmembrane monomeric Piriformospora indica phosphate transporter (PiPT), a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), as a likely structural homolog.",

Details of the intracellular signalling events controlling development of the male and female gametes from their precursors (gametocytes) remain sparse in P. falciparum. Previous work involving the addition of pharmacological agents to gametocytes implicated cGMP in exflagellation--the emergence of highly motile, flagellated male gametes from the host red blood cell. In this study we show that decreased GC activity in parasites having undergone disruption of the PfGCbeta gene had no significant effect on gametogenesis. By contrast, decreased cGMP-PDE activity during gametocyte development owing to disruption of the PfPDEdelta gene, led to a severely reduced ability to undergo gametogenesis. This suggests that the concentration of cGMP must be maintained below a threshold in the developing gametocyte to allow subsequent differentiation to proceed normally.

Fifteen min later, they were placed into a distinct compartment and injected with saline or cocaine (4.2 mg/kg, i.v.).

Locomotion and stereotypies were assessed after the first and last injection, and conditioned place preference was assessed 24 hr after the last conditioning day. After behavioral testing, receptors occupied by sulpiride were quantified by injecting rats intracranially with their respective dose of sulpiride, followed by a systemic injection of the irreversible antagonist N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ). Receptors protected from EEDQ induced inactivation by sulpiride were revealed on autoradiograms of sections labeled with 3H-sulpiride. Sulpiride did not alter cocaine-conditioned place preference or cocaine-induced stereotypies. However, the two lowest doses of intra-accumbens sulpiride attenuated cocaine-induced locomotion and occupied > 42% of the sulpiride binding sites in the NAc, and the highest dose completely reversed cocaine-induced locomotion and occupied > 96% of the sulpiride binding sites in the NAc. Intracaudate sulpiride also attenuated cocaine-induced locomotion without occupying a significant number of binding sites in the NAc. These findings suggest that D2-like receptors in the NAc and anterior medial caudate-putamen are involved in cocaine-induced locomotion, but not cocaine-conditioned place preference.",

At this angular scale, multiple stars are typically blended in the photometric apertures. In order to identify false positives and confirm transiting exoplanets, we have assembled a follow-up network (KELT-FUN) to conduct imaging with spatial resolution, cadence, and photometric precision higher than the KELT telescopes, as well as spectroscopic observations of the candidate host stars. The KELT-FUN team has followed-up over 1600 planet candidates since 2011, resulting in more than 20 planet discoveries.

        "abstract": "We describe a de novo computational approach for designing proteins that recapitulate the binding sites of natural cytokines, but are otherwise unrelated in topology or amino acid sequence. We use this strategy to design mimics of the central immune cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) that bind to the IL-2 receptor βγc heterodimer (IL-2Rβγc) but have no binding site for IL-2Rα (also called CD25) or IL-15Rα (also known as CD215). The designs are hyper-stable, bind human and mouse IL-2Rβγc with higher affinity than the natural cytokines, and elicit downstream cell signalling independently of IL-2Rα and IL-15Rα. Crystal structures of the optimized design neoleukin-2/15 (Neo-2/15), both alone and in complex with IL-2Rβγc, are very similar to the designed model. Neo-2/15 has superior therapeutic activity to IL-2 in mouse models of melanoma and colon cancer, with reduced toxicity and undetectable immunogenicity. Our strategy for building hyper-stable de novo mimetics could be applied generally to signalling proteins, enabling the creation of superior therapeutic candidates.",

We report here the characterization of an unusual PKG from the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (designated PfPKG). The 97.5 kDa protein contains some of the structural features of mammalian PKGs but, uniquely, contains a third predicted cGMP binding site and a degenerate fourth. Using both protein kinase activity assays and Western blotting with native P. falciparum proteins, we demonstrate here that PfPKG is expressed predominantly in the ring stage of the life cycle, suggesting a role in the development of asexual blood stage parasites. An Escherichia coli-derived recombinant protein (PfPKG2, Met115-Phe853) was purified and shown to have phosphotransferase activity in terms of both substrate phosphorylation and auto-phosphorylation. This activity was stimulated at least fivefold by 1.0 microM cyclic GMP, but was not stimulated by cAMP or by 8-pCPT-cGMP, which is a potent activator of mammalian PKGs. Several protein kinase inhibitors exhibited a range of inhibitory effects on PfPKG activity. Biochemical analysis therefore shows that PfPKG is distinct from mammalian PKGs with respect to both cyclic nucleotide analogue activation and inhibition profiles.",

It is also the major antigen stimulating the host's protective immune response, specifically, the production of neutralizing antibodies. Recently, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 possessing multiple mutations in the S protein, designated P.1, emerged in Brazil. Here, we characterized a P.1 variant isolated in Japan by using Syrian hamsters, a well-established small animal model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19). In hamsters, the variant showed replicative abilities and pathogenicity similar to those of early and contemporary strains (i.e., SARS-CoV-2 bearing aspartic acid [D] or glycine [G] at position 614 of the S protein). Sera and/or plasma from convalescent patients and BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccinees showed comparable neutralization titers across the P.1 variant, S-614D, and S-614G strains. In contrast, the S-614D and S-614G strains were less well recognized than the P.1 variant by serum from a P.1-infected patient. Prior infection with S-614D or S-614G strains efficiently prevented the replication of the P.1 variant in the lower respiratory tract of hamsters upon reinfection. In addition, passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies to hamsters infected with the P.1 variant or the S-614G strain led to reduced virus replication in the lower respiratory tract. However, the effect was less pronounced against the P.1 variant than the S-614G strain. These findings suggest that the P.1 variant may be somewhat antigenically different from the early and contemporary strains of SARS-CoV-2.",

As EndMT contributes to a multitude of diseases, pharmacological modulation of the signaling pathways underlying EndMT may prove to be effective as a therapeutic treatment. Additionally, EndMT in ECs could also be exploited to acquire multipotent MSCs, which can be readily re-differentiated into various distinct cell types. In this review, we will consider current models of EndMT, how manipulation of this process might improve treatment of clinically important pathologies and how it could be harnessed to advance regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.",

Here we demonstrate that, in the vBNST, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is expressed in neurons that innervate the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a site where the CRF receptor antagonist antalarmin prevents the reinstatement of cocaine seeking by a stressor, intermittent footshock, following intravenous self-administration in rats. The vBNST receives dense noradrenergic innervation and expresses β adrenergic receptors (ARs). Footshock-induced reinstatement was prevented by bilateral intra-vBNST injection of the β-2 AR antagonist, ICI-118,551, but not the β-1 AR antagonist, betaxolol. Moreover, bilateral intra-vBNST injection of the β-2 AR agonist, clenbuterol, but not the β-1 agonist, dobutamine, reinstated cocaine seeking, suggesting that activation of vBNST β-2 AR is both necessary for stress-induced reinstatement and sufficient to induce cocaine seeking. The contribution of a β-2 AR-regulated vBNST-to-VTA pathway that releases CRF was investigated using a disconnection approach. Injection of ICI-118,551 into the vBNST in one hemisphere and antalarmin into the VTA of the contralateral hemisphere prevented footshock-induced reinstatement, whereas ipsilateral manipulations failed to attenuate stress-induced cocaine seeking, suggesting that β-2 AR regulate vBNST efferents that release CRF into the VTA, activating CRF receptors, and promoting cocaine use. Last, reinstatement by clenbuterol delivered bilaterally into the vBNST was prevented by bilateral vBNST pretreatment with antalarmin, indicating that β-2 AR-mediated actions in the vBNST also require local CRF receptor activation. Understanding the processes through which stress induces cocaine seeking should guide the development of new treatments for addiction.",

Previous experiments assessing H/D isotope effects are applied to various model proteins, including lambda and Arc repressor variants, a coiled coil domain, cytochrome c, colicin immunity protein 7, proteins L and G, acylphosphatase, chymotrypsin inhibitor II and a Src SH3 domain. The change in free energy accompanied by backbone deuteration is highly correlated to secondary structure composition when hydrogen bonds are divided into two classes. The number of helical hydrogen bonds correlates with an average equilibrium isotope effect of 8.6 +/- 0.9 cal x mol(-1) x site(-1). However, beta-sheet and long-range hydrogen bonds have little isotope effect. The kinetic isotope effects support our hypothesis that, for helical proteins, hydrophobic association cannot be separated from helix formation in the transition state. Therefore, folding models that describe an incremental build-up of structure in which hydrophobic burial and hydrogen bond formation occur commensurately are more consistent with the data than are models that posit the extensive formation of one quantity before the other.",

In one of the crystal forms, the entire N-terminal histidine-tag region was immobilized through the coordination of zinc ions and its structural conformation along with the zinc coordination scheme were determined. However, the ordering of the histidine tag by zinc does not affect the overall structure of the rest of the protein. Structural comparisons of the tryptophan-containing variant with an NMR-derived wild-type structure, which contains a tyrosine at position 47, reveals a common fold, although the overall backbone root-mean-square difference is 1.5 A. The Y47W substitution only caused local rearrangement of several side chains, the most prominent of which is the rotation of the Tyr34 side chain, resulting in a 6 A displacement of its hydroxyl group. A small methyl-sized cavity bounded by beta-strands 1, 2 and 4 and the alpha-helix was found in the structures of the Y47W-substituted protein L B1 domain. This cavity may be created as the result of subsequent side-chain rearrangements caused by the Y47W substitution.

While antibody-based drugs have undeniable utility, peptides of the 1-9 kDa size range (10-80 amino acids) have drawn interest as alternate drug scaffolds This is born of a desire to identify compounds with the advantages of antibody-based therapeutics (affinity, potency, specificity, and ability to disrupt protein:protein interactions) without all of their liabilities (large size, expensive manufacturing, and necessity of humanization). Of these alternate scaffolds, cystine-dense peptides (CDPs) have several specific benefits. Due to their stable intra-chain disulfide bridges, CDPs often demonstrate resistance to heat and proteolysis, along with low immunogenicity. These properties do not require chemical modifications, permitting CDP screening by conventional genetic means. The cystine topology of a typical CDP requires an oxidative environment, and we have found that the mammalian secretory pathway is most effective at allowing diverse CDPs to achieve a stable fold. As such, high-diversity screens to identify CDPs that interact with targets of interest can be efficiently conducted using mammalian surface display. In this protocol, we present the theory and tools to conduct a mammalian surface display screen for CDPs that bind with targets of interest, including the steps to validate binding and mature the affinity of preliminary candidates. With these methods, CDPs of all kinds can be brought to bear against targets that would benefit from a peptide-based intervention.",

The spontaneous alpha-N-6 gluconoylation at the amino group of the His-tagged SH3 domain contributed to the observed extra mass.

Flexibility of the substrate is critical for recognition by Ube2w, and either point mutations in or the removal of the flexible C terminus of Ube2w inhibits substrate binding and modification.

For 37 proteins for which NMR ensembles were available and which had similar structures in solution and in the crystal, all of the restrained Rosetta refined NMR structures were sufficiently accurate to be used for solving the corresponding X-ray crystal structures by molecular replacement. The protocol for restrained refinement of protein NMR structures was also compared with restrained CS-Rosetta calculations. For proteins smaller than 10 kDa, restrained CS-Rosetta, starting from extended conformations, provides slightly more accurate structures, while for proteins in the size range of 10-25 kDa the less CPU intensive restrained Rosetta refinement protocols provided equally or more accurate structures. The restrained Rosetta protocols described here can improve the accuracy of protein NMR structures and should find broad and general for studies of protein structure and function.",

Here, we present an automated method (RosettaOligomers) for determining the solution structures of oligomeric systems using only chemical shifts, sparse NOEs, and domain orientation restraints from residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) without a need for a previously determined structure of the monomeric subunit. The method integrates previously developed Rosetta protocols for solving the structures of monomeric proteins using sparse NMR data and for predicting the structures of both nonintertwined and intertwined symmetric oligomers. We illustrated the performance of the method using a benchmark set of nine protein dimers, one trimer, and one tetramer with available experimental data and various interface topologies. The final converged structures are found to be in good agreement with both experimental data and previously published high-resolution structures. The new approach is more readily applicable to large oligomeric systems than conventional structure-determination protocols, which often require a large number of NOEs, and will likely become increasingly relevant as more high-molecular weight systems are studied by NMR.",

Indeed, energy-based refinement of comparative models generally leads to degradation rather than improvement in model quality, and, hence, most current comparative modeling procedures omit physically based refinement. However, despite their inaccuracies, current force fields do contain information that is orthogonal to the evolutionary information on which comparative models are based, and, hence, refinement might be able to improve comparative models if the space that is sampled is restricted sufficiently so that false attractors are avoided.

Here we investigate an extension of Zwanzig's simple and general model of folding in which local and nonlocal interactions are represented by functions of single and multiple conformational degrees of freedom, respectively. The kinetics and thermodynamics of folding are studied for a series of energy functions in which the energy of the native structure is fixed, but the relative contributions of local and nonlocal interactions to this energy are varied over a broad range. For funnel shaped energy landscapes, we find that 1) the rate of folding increases, but the stability of the folded state decreases, as the contribution of local interactions to the energy of the native structure increases, and 2) the amount of native structure in the unfolded state and the transition state vary considerably with the local interaction strength. Simple exponential kinetics and a well-defined free energy barrier separating folded and unfolded states are observed when nonlocal interactions make an appreciable contribution to the energy of the native structure; in such cases a transition state theory type approximation yields reasonably accurate estimates of the folding rate. Bumps in the folding funnel near the native state, which could result from desolvation effects, side chain freezing, or the breaking of nonnative contacts, significantly alter the dependence of the folding rate on the local interaction strength: the rate of folding decreases when the local interaction strength is increased beyond a certain point. A survey of the distribution of strong contacts in the protein structure database suggests that evolutionary optimization has involved both kinetics and thermodynamics: strong contacts are enriched at both very short and very long sequence separations.",

Two different architectures of the T3SS needle have been previously proposed. First, an atomic model of the Salmonella typhimurium needle was generated from solid-state NMR data. The needle subunit protein, PrgI, comprises a rigid-extended N-terminal segment and a helix-loop-helix motif with the N-terminus located on the outside face of the needle. Second, a model of the Shigella flexneri needle was generated from a high-resolution 7.7-Å cryo-electron microscopy density map. The subunit protein, MxiH, contains an N-terminal α-helix, a loop, another α-helix, a 14-residue-long β-hairpin (Q51-Q64) and a C-terminal α-helix, with the N-terminus facing inward to the lumen of the needle. In the current study, we carried out solid-state NMR measurements of wild-type Shigella flexneri needles polymerized in vitro and identified the following secondary structure elements for MxiH: a rigid-extended N-terminal segment (S2-T11), an α-helix (L12-A38), a loop (E39-P44) and a C-terminal α-helix (Q45-R83). Using immunogold labeling in vitro and in vivo on functional needles, we located the N-terminus of MxiH subunits on the exterior of the assembly, consistent with evolutionary sequence conservation patterns and mutagenesis data. We generated a homology model of Shigella flexneri needles compatible with both experimental data: the MxiH solid-state NMR chemical shifts and the state-of-the-art cryoEM density map. These results corroborate the solid-state NMR structure previously solved for Salmonella typhimurium PrgI needles and establish that Shigella flexneri and Salmonella typhimurium subunit proteins adopt a conserved structure and orientation in their assembled state. Our study reveals a common structural architecture of T3SS needles, essential to understand T3SS-mediated infection and develop treatments.",

We present a new, multilevel approach to beta-sheet structure prediction that circumvents this difficulty by reformulating structure generation in terms of a folding tree. Nonlocal connections in this tree allow us to explicitly sample alternative beta-strand pairings while simultaneously exploring local conformational space using backbone torsion-space moves. An iterative, energy-biased resampling strategy is used to explore the space of beta-strand pairings; we expect that such a strategy will be generally useful for searching large conformational spaces with a high degree of combinatorial complexity.",

        "abstract": "Improving an enzyme's initially low catalytic efficiency with a new target substrate by an order of magnitude or two may require only a few rounds of mutagenesis and screening or selection. However, subsequent rounds of optimization tend to yield decreasing degrees of improvement (diminishing returns) eventually leading to an optimization plateau. We aimed to optimize the catalytic efficiency of bacterial phosphotriesterase (PTE) toward V-type nerve agents. Previously, we improved the catalytic efficiency of wild-type PTE toward the nerve agent VX by 500-fold, to a catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of 5 × 106 M-1 min-1. However, effective in vivo detoxification demands an enzyme with a catalytic efficiency of >107 M-1 min-1. Here, following eight additional rounds of directed evolution and the computational design of a stabilized variant, we evolved PTE variants that detoxify VX with a kcat/KM ≥ 5 × 107 M-1 min-1 and Russian VX (RVX) with a kcat/KM ≥ 107 M-1 min-1. These final 10-fold improvements were the most time consuming and laborious, as most libraries yielded either minor or no improvements. Stabilizing the evolving enzyme, and avoiding tradeoffs in activity with different substrates, enabled us to obtain further improvements beyond the optimization plateau and evolve PTE variants that were overall improved by >5000-fold with VX and by >17 000-fold with RVX. The resulting variants also hydrolyze G-type nerve agents with high efficiency (GA, GB at kcat/KM > 5 × 107 M-1 min-1) and can thus serve as candidates for broad-spectrum nerve-agent prophylaxis and post-exposure therapy using low enzyme doses.",

Measurements of methyl 2H spin relaxation rates, which probe dynamics on a picosecond-nanosecond time scale, and three-bond 3J(Cgamma-CO), 3J(Cgamma-N) and 3J(Calpha-Cdelta) scalar coupling constants, which are sensitive to motion spanning a wide range of time-scales, reveal changes in the magnitude of side-chain dynamics in response to mutation. Observed differences in the time-scale of motions between the variants have been related to changes in energetic barriers. Of interest, several of the residues with different motional properties across the variants are far from the site of mutation, suggesting the presence of long-range interactions within the protein that can be probed through studies of dynamics.",

        "abstract": "nce Reengineering naturally occurring proteins to have new functions has had considerable impact on industrial and biomedical applications, but is limited by the finite number of known proteins. A promise of de novo protein design is to generate a larger and more diverse set of protein structures than is currently available. This vision has not yet been realized for small-molecule binder or enzyme design due to the complexity of pocket-containing structures. Here we present an algorithm that systematically generates NTF2-like protein structures with diverse pocket geometries. The scaffold sets, the insights gained from detailed structural characterization, and the computational method for generating unlimited numbers of structures should contribute to a new generation of de novo small-molecule binding proteins and catalysts. To create new enzymes and biosensors from scratch, precise control over the structure of small-molecule binding sites is of paramount importance, but systematically designing arbitrary protein pocket shapes and sizes remains an outstanding challenge. Using the NTF2-like structural superfamily as a model system, we developed an enumerative algorithm for creating a virtually unlimited number of de novo proteins supporting diverse pocket structures. The enumerative algorithm was tested and refined through feedback from two rounds of large-scale experimental testing, involving in total the assembly of synthetic genes encoding 7,896 designs and assessment of their stability on yeast cell surface, detailed biophysical characterization of 64 designs, and crystal structures of 5 designs. The refined algorithm generates proteins that remain folded at high temperatures and exhibit more pocket diversity than naturally occurring NTF2-like proteins. We expect this approach to transform the design of small-molecule sensors and enzymes by enabling the creation of binding and active site geometries much more optimal for specific design challenges than is accessible by repurposing the limited number of naturally occurring NTF2-like proteins.",

Here we describe a large-scale energy optimization-based refinement method that incorporates advances in both search and energy function accuracy that can substantially improve the accuracy of low-resolution homology models. The method refined low-resolution homology models into correct folds for 50 of 84 diverse protein families and generated improved models in recent blind structure prediction experiments.

Using directed mutagenesis, we identified three LF-PA contact points defined by a specific disulfide crosslink and two pairs of complementary charge-reversal mutations. These contact points were consistent with the lowest energy LF-PA complex found by using Rosetta protein-protein docking. These results illustrate how biochemical and computational methods can be combined to produce reliable models of large complexes. The model shows that EF and LF bind through a highly electrostatic interface, with their flexible N-terminal region positioned at the entrance of the heptameric PA pore and thus poised to initiate translocation in an N- to C-terminal direction.",

The results of such large-scale structure-functional annotation provide a comprehensive view of the MSY proteome, shedding light on MSY-related processes. We found that, in total, at least 60 domains are encoded by 27 distinct MSY genes, of which 42 (70%) were reliably mapped to currently known structures.

We discuss relatively straightforward COMPASS predictions that are new and interesting to us, and that would require a substantial time and effort to justify even for a skilled PSI-BLAST user. All of the presented COMPASS hits are independently confirmed by other methods, including the ab initio structure-prediction method ROSETTA. The tertiary structure predictions made by ROSETTA proved to be useful for improving sequence-derived alignments, because they are based on a reasonable folding of the polypeptide chain rather than on the information from sequence databases. The ability of COMPASS to predict new relations within the PFAM database indicates the high sensitivity of COMPASS searches and substantiates its potential value for the discovery of previously unknown similarities between protein families.",

We also show that another parasite protein with putative cyclic nucleotide binding sites, Plasmodium falciparum EPAC (PfEpac), does not play an essential role in blood stages.

The resulting model has the accuracy of AlphaFold2 on monomers, and AlphaFold2-multimer on complexes, with better computational scaling for large proteins and complexes. This excellent performance is achieved without hallmark features of AlphaFold2, invariant point attention and triangle attention, indicating that these are not essential for high accuracy prediction.

Refinement of the NMR structure ensemble, using a Rosetta protocol in the absence of NMR restraints, resulted in significant improvements not only in structure quality, but also in molecular replacement (MR) performance with the raw X-ray diffraction data using MOLREP and Phaser. This method has recently been shown to be generally applicable with improved MR performance demonstrated for eight NMR structures refined using Rosetta (Qian et al., Nature 2007;450:259-264). Additionally, NMR structures of HSPC034 calculated by standard methods that include NMR restraints have improvements in the RMSD to the crystal structure and MR performance in the order DYANA, CYANA, XPLOR-NIH, and CNS with explicit water refinement (CNSw). Further Rosetta refinement of the CNSw structures, perhaps due to more thorough conformational sampling and/or a superior force field, was capable of finding alternative low energy protein conformations that were equally consistent with the NMR data according to the Recall, Precision, and F-measure (RPF) scores. On further examination, the additional MR-performance shortfall for NMR refined structures as compared with the X-ray structure were attributed, in part, to crystal-packing effects, real structural differences, and inferior hydrogen bonding in the NMR structures. A good correlation between a decrease in the number of buried unsatisfied hydrogen-bond donors and improved MR performance demonstrates the importance of hydrogen-bond terms in the force field for improving NMR structures. The superior hydrogen-bond network in Rosetta-refined structures demonstrates that correct identification of hydrogen bonds should be a critical goal of NMR structure refinement.

A49, 97-104] which makes use of the information that proteins consist of connected linear chains of atoms. An initial electron-density map is generated with inaccurate phases derived from a partial structure or from isomorphous replacement. A linear connected skeleton is then constructed from the map using a modified version of Greer's algorithm [Greer (1985). Methods Enzymol. 115, 206-226] and a new map is created from the skeleton. This 'skeletonized' map is Fourier transformed to obtained new phases, which are combined with any starting-phase information and the experimental structure-factor amplitudes to produce a new map. The procedure is iterated until convergence is reached. In this paper significant improvements to the method are described as is a challenging molecular-replacement test case in which initial phases are calculated from a model containing only one third of the atoms of the intact protein. Application of the skeletonization procedure yields an easily interpretable map. In contrast, application of solvent flattening does not significantly improve the starting map. The iterative skeletonization procedure performs well in the presence of random noise and missing data, but requires Fourier data to at least 3.0 A. The constraints of linearity and connectedness prove strong enough to restore not only missing phase information, but also missing amplitudes. This enables the use of a powerful statistical test, analogous to the 'free R factor' of conventional refinement [Brünger (1992). Nature (London), 355, 472-474], for optimizing the performance of the skeletonization procedure. In the accompanying paper, we describe the application of the method to the solution of the structure of the protease inhibitor ecotin bound to trypsin and to a single isomorphous replacement problem.",

Most of the previous studies in this area focused on O-GlcNAc modification of the amyloid-forming proteins themselves. Here we used synthetic protein chemistry to discover that O-GlcNAc also activates the anti-amyloid activity of certain small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), a potentially more important modification event that can act broadly and substoichiometrically. More specifically, we found that O-GlcNAc increases the ability of sHSPs to block the amyloid formation of both α-synuclein and Aβ(1-42). Mechanistically, we show that O-GlcNAc near the sHSP IXI-domain prevents its ability to intramolecularly compete with substrate binding. Finally, we found that, although O-GlcNAc levels are globally reduced in Alzheimer's disease brains, the modification of relevant sHSPs is either maintained or increased, which suggests a mechanism to maintain these potentially protective O-GlcNAc modifications. Our results have important implications for neurodegenerative diseases associated with amyloid formation and potentially other areas of sHSP biology.",

We find enrichments in the native distributions for T-shaped and parallel offset arrangements of aromatic residue pairs, in parallel stacked arrangements of cation-aromatic pairs, in parallel stacked pairs involving proline residues, and in parallel offset arrangements for aliphatic residue pairs. We then investigate the extent to which the distinctive features of native packing can be explained using Lennard-Jones and electrostatics models. Finally, we derive orientation-dependent pi-pi, cation-pi and hydrophobic interaction potentials based on the differences between the native and compact decoy distributions and investigate their efficacy for high-resolution protein structure prediction.

What has become very clear is that cyclic nucleotides play vital roles in controlling every stage of the complex malaria parasite life cycle.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the technology that is currently most widely used for the analysis of these highly complex metabolite mixtures, and hundreds of metabolites can be detected without any upfront separation. We have investigated in this study whether gas chromatography (GC) separation in combination with flame ionisation detection (FID) and mass spectrometry (MS) detection can be used for metabolite profiling from urine. We show that although GC sample preparation is much more involved than for NMR, hundreds of metabolites can reproducibly be detected and analysed by GC. We show that the data quality is sufficiently high--particularly if appropriate baseline correction and time-warping methods are applied--to allow for data comparison by chemometrics methods. A sample set of urines from eleven healthy human volunteers was analysed independently by GC and NMR, and subsequent chemometrics analysis of the two datasets showed some similar features. As judged by NIST database searches of the GC/MS data some of the major metabolites that are detected by NMR are also visible by GC/MS. Since in contrast to NMR every peak in GC corresponds to a single metabolite, the electron ionisation spectra can be used to quickly identify metabolites of interest if their reference spectra are present in a searchable database. In summary, we show that GC is a method that can be used as a complementary tool to NMR for metabolite profiling of urine samples.",

        "abstract": "Long insertions into a loop of a folded host protein are expected to have destabilizing effects because of the entropic cost associated with loop closure unless the inserted sequence adopts a folded structure with amino- and carboxy-termini in close proximity. A loop entropy reduction screen based on this concept was used in an attempt to retrieve folded sequences from random sequence libraries. A library of long random sequences was inserted into a loop of the SH2 domain, displayed on the surface of M13 phage, and the inserted sequences that did not disrupt SH2 function were retrieved by panning using beads coated with a phosphotyrosine containing SH2 peptide ligand. Two sequences of a library of 2 x 10(8) sequences were isolated after multiple rounds of panning, and were found to have recovery levels similar to the wild-type SH2 domain and to be relatively intolerant to further mutation in PCR mutagenesis experiments. Surprisingly, although these inserted sequences exhibited little nonrandom structure, they do not significantly destabilize the host SH2 domain. Additional insertion variants recovered at lower levels in the panning experiments were also found to have a minimal effect on the stability and peptide-binding function of the SH2 domain. The additional level of selection present in the panning experiments is likely to involve in vivo folding and assembly, as there was a rough correlation between recovery levels in the phage-panning experiments and protein solubility. The finding that loop insertions of 60-80 amino acids have minimal effects on SH2 domain stability suggests that the free energy cost of inserting long loops may be considerably less than polymer theory estimates based on the entropic cost of loop closure, and, hence, that loop insertion may have provided an evolutionary route to multidomain protein structures.",

Widely used molecular mechanics (MM) forcefields obtain parameters from experimental data and quantum chemistry calculations on small molecules but do not have a clear way to take advantage of the information in high-resolution macromolecular structures. In contrast, knowledge-based methods largely ignore the physical chemistry of interatomic interactions, and instead derive parameters almost exclusively from macromolecular structures. This can involve considerable double counting of the same physical interactions. Here, we describe a method for forcefield improvement that combines the strengths of the two approaches. We use this method to improve the Rosetta all-atom forcefield, in which the total energy is expressed as the sum of terms representing different physical interactions as in MM forcefields and the parameters are tuned to reproduce the properties of macromolecular structures. To resolve inaccuracies resulting from possible double counting of interactions, we compare distribution functions from low-energy modeled structures to those from crystal structures. The structural and physical bases of the deviations between the modeled and reference structures are identified and used to guide forcefield improvements. We describe improvements resolving double counting between backbone hydrogen bond interactions and Lennard-Jones interactions in helices; between sidechain-backbone hydrogen bonds and the backbone torsion potential; and between the sidechain torsion potential and Lennard-Jones interactions. Discrepancies between computed and observed distributions are also used to guide the incorporation of an explicit Cα-hydrogen bond in β sheets.

The gene consists of five exons and four introns. The open reading frame resulting from removal of the four introns encodes a protein of 562 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 65.3 kDa. The encoded protein, termed PfCDPK3, consists of four distinct domains characteristic of a member of the CDPK family and displays the highest homology (46% identity and 69% similarity) to PfCDPK2, the second CDPK of P. falciparum. The N-terminal variable domain is rich in serine/threonine and lysine and contains multiple consensus phosphorylation sites for a range of protein kinases. The catalytic domain possesses all conserved motifs of the protein kinase family except for the highly conserved glutamic acid residue in subdomain VIII, which is replaced by a glutamine residue. The sequence of the junction domain comprising 31 amino acid residues is less conserved. The calmodulin-like regulatory domain contains four EF-hand calcium-binding motifs, each consisting of a loop of 12 amino acid residues which is flanked by two alpha-helices. Southern blotting of genomic DNA digests showed that the Pfcdpk3 gene is present as a single copy per haploid genome. A 2900 nucleotide transcript of this gene is expressed specifically in the sexual erythrocytic stage, indicating that PfCDPK3 is involved in sexual stage-specific events.

        "abstract": "The Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway has a well-documented, context-dependent role in breast cancer development. In normal and premalignant cells, it acts as a tumor suppressor. By contrast, during the malignant phases of breast cancer progression, the TGF-β signaling pathway elicits tumor promoting effects particularly by driving the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which enhances tumor cell migration, invasion and ultimately metastasis to distant organs. The molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern this dual capacity are being uncovered at multiple molecular levels. This review will focus on recent advances relating to how epigenetic changes such as acetylation and methylation control the outcome of TGF-β signaling and alter the fate of breast cancer cells. In addition, we will highlight how this knowledge can be further exploited to curb tumorigenesis by selective targeting of the TGF-β signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is commonly used as a protein fusion domain to facilitate expression and purification of recombinant proteins, and a SUMO-specific protease is then used to remove SUMO from these proteins. Although this protease is highly specific, its limited solubility and stability hamper its utility as an in vitro reagent. Here, we report improved SUMO protease enzymes obtained via two approaches. First, we developed a computational method and used it to re-engineer WT Ulp1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to improve protein solubility. Second, we discovered an improved SUMO protease via genomic mining of the thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum, as proteins from thermophilic organisms are commonly employed as reagent enzymes. Following expression in Escherichia coli, we found that these re-engineered enzymes can be more thermostable and up to 12 times more soluble, all while retaining WT-or-better levels of SUMO protease activity. The computational method we developed to design solubility-enhancing substitutions is based on the RosettaScripts application for the macromolecular modeling suite Rosetta, and it is broadly applicable for the improvement of solution properties of other proteins. Moreover, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of a SUMO protease from C. thermophilum to 1.44 Å resolution. This structure revealed that this enzyme exhibits structural and functional conservation with the S. cerevisiae SUMO protease, despite exhibiting only 28% sequence identity. In summary, by re-engineering the Ulp1 protease and discovering a SUMO protease from C. thermophilum, we have obtained proteases that are more soluble, more thermostable, and more efficient than the current commercially available Ulp1 enzyme.",

Alternatively, a 3D structure can be defined by incorporating a multivalent cross-linking agent, and this approach has been successfully developed for the selection of bicyclic peptides from large random-sequence libraries. By contrast, there is no general method for the de novo computational design of multicross-linked proteins with predictable and well-defined folds, including ones not found in nature. Here we use Rosetta and Tertiary Motifs (TERMs) to design small proteins that fold around multivalent cross-linkers. The hydrophobic cross-linkers stabilize the fold by macrocyclic restraints, and they also form an integral part of a small apolar core. The designed CovCore proteins were prepared by chemical synthesis, and their structures were determined by solution NMR or X-ray crystallography. These mesosized proteins, lying between conventional proteins and small peptides, are easily accessible either through biosynthetic precursors or chemical synthesis. The unique tertiary structures and ease of synthesis of CovCore proteins indicate that they should provide versatile templates for developing inhibitors of protein-protein interactions.",

Here, multiple rational design methods were used to engineer ICAM-1 mutants with enhanced affinity for LFA-1. Five amino acid substitutions 1) enhance the hydrophobicity and packing of residues surrounding Glu-34 of ICAM-1, which coordinates to a Mg2+ in the LFA-1 I domain, and 2) alter associations at the edges of the binding interface. The affinity of the most improved ICAM-1 mutant for intermediate- and high-affinity LFA-1 I domains was increased by 19-fold and 22-fold, respectively, relative to wild type. Moreover, potency was similarly enhanced for inhibition of LFA-1-dependent ligand binding and cell adhesion. Thus, rational design can be used to engineer novel adhesion molecules with high monomeric affinity; furthermore, the ICAM-1 mutant holds promise for targeting LFA-1-ICAM-1 interaction for biological studies and therapeutic purposes.",

Because of the large chemical space spanned by drug-like molecules, classical force fields contain thousands of parameters describing atom-pair distance and torsional preferences; each parameter is typically optimized independently on simple representative molecules. Here, we describe a new approach in which small molecule force field parameters are jointly optimized guided by the rich source of information contained within thousands of available small molecule crystal structures. We optimize parameters by requiring that the experimentally determined molecular lattice arrangements have lower energy than all alternative lattice arrangements. Thousands of independent crystal lattice-prediction simulations were run on each of 1386 small molecule crystal structures, and energy function parameters of an implicit solvent energy model were optimized, so native crystal lattice arrangements had the lowest energy. The resulting energy model was implemented in Rosetta, together with a rapid genetic algorithm docking method employing grid-based scoring and receptor flexibility. The success rate of bound structure recapitulation in cross-docking on 1112 complexes was improved by more than 10% over previously published methods, with solutions within <1 Å in over half of the cases. Our results demonstrate that small molecule crystal structures are a rich source of information for guiding molecular force field development, and the improved Rosetta energy function should increase accuracy in a wide range of small molecule structure prediction and design studies.",

        "abstract": "Previous in vitro studies have shown that group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) regulate synaptic glutamate release. The present study used microdialysis to characterize this regulation in vivo in rat nucleus accumbens. Reverse dialysis of the group III mGluR agonist l-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4) decreased, whereas the antagonist (R,S)-alpha-methylserine-O-phosphate (MSOP) increased the extracellular level of glutamate. The decrease by L-AP4 or the increase by MSOP was antagonized by co-administration of MSOP or L-AP4, respectively. Activation of mGluR4a by (1S,3R,4S)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid or mGluR6 by 2-amino-4-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)butyric acid had no effect on extracellular glutamate. (R,S)-4-Phosphonophenylglycine (PPG), another group III agonist with high affinity for mGluR4/6/8, reduced extracellular glutamate only at high concentrations capable of binding to mGluR7. The increase in extracellular glutamate by MSOP was tetrodotoxin-independent, and resistant to both the L-type and N-type Ca2+ channel blockers. L-AP4 failed to block 30 mm K+-induced vesicular glutamate release. Blockade of glutamate uptake by d,l-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate caused a Ca2+-independent elevation in extracellular glutamate that was reversed by L-AP4. Finally, (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine, an inhibitor of cystine-glutamate antiporters, attenuated the L-AP4-induced reduction in extracellular glutamate. Together, these data indicate that group III mGluRs regulate in vivo extracellular glutamate in the nucleus accumbens by inhibiting non-vesicular glutamate release.",

However, helix-destabilizing mutations had little effect on the rate of folding; in particular, a triple glycine substitution on the solvent-exposed side of the helix increased the unfolding rate 56-fold while reducing the folding rate less than threefold.

Evolutionary optimization of a primitive design afforded an efficient and enantioselective enzyme (BH32.14) for the Morita-Baylis-Hillman (MBH) reaction. BH32.14 is suitable for preparative-scale transformations, accepts a broad range of aldehyde and enone coupling partners and is able to promote selective monofunctionalizations of dialdehydes. Crystallographic, biochemical and computational studies reveal that BH32.14 operates via a sophisticated catalytic mechanism comprising a His23 nucleophile paired with a judiciously positioned Arg124. This catalytic arginine shuttles between conformational states to stabilize multiple oxyanion intermediates and serves as a genetically encoded surrogate of privileged bidentate hydrogen-bonding catalysts (for example, thioureas). This study demonstrates that elaborate catalytic devices can be built from scratch to promote demanding multi-step processes not observed in nature.",

Here we report the structure of an archaeal group II chaperonin in its prehydrolysis ATP-bound state at subnanometer resolution using single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Structural comparison of Mm-cpn in ATP-free, ATP-bound, and ATP-hydrolysis states reveals that ATP binding alone causes the chaperonin to close slightly with a ∼45° counterclockwise rotation of the apical domain. The subsequent ATP hydrolysis drives each subunit to rock toward the folding chamber and to close the lid completely. These motions are attributable to the local interactions of specific active site residues with the nucleotide, the tight couplings between the apical and intermediate domains within the subunit, and the aligned interactions between two subunits across the rings. This mechanism of structural changes in response to ATP is entirely different from those found in group I chaperonins.",

In recent years, 3-D electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) has assumed an increasingly important role in determining the structures of these large macromolecular assemblies to intermediate resolutions (6-10 A). While these structures provide a snapshot of the assembly and its components in well-defined functional states, the resolution limits the ability to build accurate structural models. In contrast, sequence-based modeling techniques are capable of producing relatively robust structural models for isolated proteins or domains. In this work, we developed and applied a hybrid modeling approach, utilizing cryoEM density and ab initio modeling to produce a structural model for the core domain of a herpesvirus structural protein, VP26. Specifically, this method, first tested on simulated data, utilizes the cryoEM density map as a geometrical constraint in identifying the most native-like models from a gallery of models generated by ab initio modeling. The resulting model for the core domain of VP26, based on the 8.5-A resolution herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) capsid cryoEM structure and mutational data, exhibited a novel fold. Additionally, the core domain of VP26 appeared to have a complementary interface to the known upper-domain structure of VP5, its cognate binding partner. While this new model provides for a better understanding of the assembly and interactions of VP26 in HSV-1, the approach itself may have broader applications in modeling the components of large macromolecular assemblies.",

While considerable protein structural information is available, the most successful current methods use sequence information alone, in part because it has been a challenge to model the subtle structural changes accompanying sequence substitutions. Protein structure prediction networks such as AlphaFold model sequence-structure relationships very accurately, and we reasoned that if it were possible to specifically train such networks on binding data, more generalizable models could be created. We show that placing a classifier on top of the AlphaFold network and fine-tuning the combined network parameters for both classification and structure prediction accuracy leads to a model with strong generalizable performance on a wide range of Class I and Class II peptide-MHC interactions that approaches the overall performance of the state-of-the-art NetMHCpan sequence-based method. The peptide-MHC optimized model shows excellent performance in distinguishing binding and non-binding peptides to SH3 and PDZ domains.

Nanoparticles of different sizes and geometries can be designed and combined with appropriate antigens to fit the requirements of different immunization strategies. Here, we describe detailed antigenic, structural, and functional characterization of computationally designed tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral nanoparticle immunogens displaying trimeric HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) ectodomains. Env trimers, based on subtype A (BG505) or consensus group M (ConM) sequences and engineered with SOSIP stabilizing mutations, were fused to the underlying trimeric building block of each nanoparticle. Initial screening yielded one icosahedral and two tetrahedral nanoparticle candidates, capable of presenting twenty or four copies of the Env trimer. A number of analyses, including detailed structural characterization by cryo-EM, demonstrated that the nanoparticle immunogens possessed the intended structural and antigenic properties. Comparing the humoral responses elicited by ConM-SOSIP trimers presented on a two-component tetrahedral nanoparticle to the corresponding soluble protein revealed that multivalent presentation increased the proportion of the overall antibody response directed against autologous neutralizing Ab epitopes present on the ConM-SOSIP trimers. Author Summary Protein constructs based on soluble ectodomains of HIV glycoprotein (Env) trimers are the basis of many current HIV vaccine platforms. Multivalent antigen display is one strategy applied to improve the immunogenicity of different subunit vaccine candidates.

Although DNA microarrays have decreased the cost of oligonucleotide synthesis, the use of array-synthesized oligos in practice is limited by short synthesis lengths, high synthesis error rates, low yield and the challenges of assembling long constructs from complex pools. Toward addressing these issues, we developed a protocol for multiplex pairwise assembly of oligos from array-synthesized oligonucleotide pools. To evaluate the method, we attempted to assemble up to 2271 targets ranging in length from 192-252 bases using pairs of array-synthesized oligos. Within sets of complexity ranging from 131-250 targets, we observed error-free assemblies for 90.5% of all targets. When all 2271 targets were assembled in one reaction, we observed error-free constructs for 70.6%. While the assembly method intrinsically increased accuracy to a small degree, we further increased accuracy by using a high throughput 'Dial-Out PCR' protocol, which combines Illumina sequencing with an in-house set of unique PCR tags to selectively amplify perfect assemblies from complex synthetic pools. This approach has broad applicability to DNA assembly and high-throughput functional screens.",

Topoisomerase-II has been identified as a crucial regulator of segregation in a wide range of organisms and exhibits premitotic accumulation at centromeres. Consistent with this property, treatment of cells with the topoisomerase-II inhibitor etoposide promotes chromosomal cleavage at sites within centromeric DNA. In the case of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, despite a completed genome sequence, there are no experimental data on the nature of centromeres. To address this issue, we have used etoposide-mediated topoisomerase-II cleavage as a biochemical marker to map centromeric DNA on all 14 parasite chromosomes. We find that topoisomerase-II activity is concentrated at single chromosomal loci and that cleavage sites extend over approximately 10 kb. A shared feature of these topoisomerase-II cleavage sites is the presence of an extremely AT-rich ( approximately 97%) domain with a strictly defined size limit of 2.3-2.5 kb. Repetitive arrays identified within the domains do not display interchromosomal conservation in terms of length, copy number, or sequence.

The present study examined the role of β-adrenergic receptor subtypes in the stressor-induced reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-induced (15 mg/kg i.p.) conditioned place preference in mice. Forced swim (6 min at 22°C) stress or activation of central noradrenergic neurotransmission by administration of the selective α(2) adrenergic receptor antagonist 2-[(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-1H-isoindole (BRL-44,408) (10 mg/kg i.p.) induced reinstatement in wild-type, but not β- adrenergic receptor-deficient Adrb1/Adrb2 double-knockout, mice.

Forced swim-induced, but not BRL-44,408-induced, reinstatement was also blocked by a high (20 mg/kg) but not low (10 mg/kg) dose of the β(1) adrenergic receptor antagonist betaxolol, and isoproterenol-induced reinstatement was blocked by pretreatment with either ICI-118,551 or betaxolol, suggesting a potential cooperative role for β(1) and β(2) adrenergic receptors in stress-induced reinstatement. Overall, these findings suggest that targeting β-adrenergic receptors may represent a promising pharmacotherapeutic strategy for preventing drug relapse, particularly in cocaine addicts whose drug use is stress related.",

A theoretical understanding of the signal-to-noise ratio in likelihood-based molecular replacement searches has been developed to account for the influence of model quality and completeness, as well as the resolution of the diffraction data. Here we show that, contrary to current belief, molecular replacement need not be restricted to the use of models comprising a substantial fraction of the unknown structure. Instead, likelihood-based methods allow a continuum of applications depending predictably on the quality of the model and the resolution of the data. Unexpectedly, our understanding of the signal-to-noise ratio in molecular replacement leads to the finding that, with data to sufficiently high resolution, fragments as small as single atoms of elements usually found in proteins can yield ab initio solutions of macromolecular structures, including some that elude traditional direct methods.",

We show that intranasal delivery of HB36.6 affords protection in mice lethally challenged with diverse strains of influenza independent of Fc-mediated effector functions or a host antiviral immune response. This designed protein prevents infection when given as a single dose of 6.0 mg/kg up to 48 hours before viral challenge and significantly reduces disease when administered as a daily therapeutic after challenge. A single dose of 10.0 mg/kg HB36.6 administered 1-day post-challenge resulted in substantially better protection than 10 doses of oseltamivir administered twice daily for 5 days. Thus, binding of HB36.6 to the influenza HA stem region alone, independent of a host response, is sufficient to reduce viral infection and replication in vivo.

        "abstract": "Prediction of protein structures from sequences is a fundamental problem in computational biology. Algorithms that attempt to predict a structure from sequence primarily use two sources of information. The first source is physical in nature: proteins fold into their lowest energy state. Given an energy function that describes the interactions governing folding, a method for constructing models of protein structures, and the amino acid sequence of a protein of interest, the structure prediction problem becomes a search for the lowest energy structure. Evolution provides an orthogonal source of information: proteins of similar sequences have similar structure, and therefore proteins of known structure can guide modeling. The relatively successful Rosetta approach takes advantage of the first, but not the second source of information during model optimization. Following the classic work by Andrej Sali and colleagues, we develop a probabilistic approach to derive spatial restraints from proteins of known structure using advances in alignment technology and the growth in the number of structures in the Protein Data Bank. These restraints define a region of conformational space that is high-probability, given the template information, and we incorporate them into Rosetta's comparative modeling protocol. The combined approach performs considerably better on a benchmark based on previous CASP experiments. Incorporating evolutionary information into Rosetta is analogous to incorporating sparse experimental data: in both cases, the additional information eliminates large regions of conformational space and increases the probability that energy-based refinement will hone in on the deep energy minimum at the native state.",

Tel orchestrates endothelial sprouting by binding to the generic co-repressor, CtBP. The Tel-CtBP complex temporally restricts a VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)-mediated pulse of dll4 expression and thereby directly links VEGF receptor intracellular signalling and intercellular Notch-Dll4 signalling. It further controls branching by regulating expression of other factors that constrain angiogenesis such as sprouty family members and ve-cadherin. Thus, the Tel-CtBP complex conditions endothelial cells for angiogenesis by controlling the balance between stimulatory and antagonistic sprouting cues. Tel control of branching seems to be a refinement of invertebrate tracheae morphogenesis that requires Yan, the invertebrate orthologue of Tel. This work highlights Tel and its associated networks as potential targets for the development of therapeutic strategies to inhibit pathological angiogenesis.",

Depending on the size of the protein and quality of the spectral data, this can be a time-consuming manual process requiring several rounds of peak list refinement and structure determination. Programs such as Aria, CYANA, and AutoStructure can generate models using unassigned NOESY data but are very sensitive to the quality of the input peak lists and can converge to inaccurate structures if the signal-to-noise of the peak lists is low. Here, we show that models with high accuracy and reliability can be produced by combining the strengths of the high-resolution structure prediction program Rosetta with global measures of the agreement between structure models and experimental data. A first round of models generated using CS-Rosetta (Rosetta supplemented with backbone chemical shift information) are filtered on the basis of their goodness-of-fit with unassigned NOESY peak lists using the DP-score, and the best fitting models are subjected to high resolution refinement with the Rosetta rebuild-and-refine protocol. This hybrid approach uses both local backbone chemical shift and the unassigned NOESY data to direct Rosetta trajectories toward the native structure and produces more accurate models than AutoStructure/CYANA or CS-Rosetta alone, particularly when using raw unedited NOESY peak lists. We also show that when accurate manually refined NOESY peak lists are available, Rosetta refinement can consistently increase the accuracy of models generated using CYANA and AutoStructure.",

To find new classes of PKG inhibitors to serve as alternative chemical starting points, we performed a high-throughput screen of the GSK Full Diversity Collection using recombinant P. falciparum PKG. We developed a robust enzymatic assay in a 1536-well plate format. Promising compounds were then tested for activity against P. falciparum asexual blood stage growth, selectivity and cytotoxicity.

Class 1 compounds have a pyrimidine linker and inhibit parasite growth at late schizogony, whereas class 2 compounds have a nonpyrimidine linker and inhibit growth in the trophozoite stage, indicating different modes of action for the two classes. The compounds also inhibited cyclic GMP (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKG), and their potency against this enzyme was greatly reduced by substitution of the enzyme's gatekeeper residue at the ATP binding site. The effectiveness of the class 1 compounds against a parasite line expressing the modified PKG was also substantially reduced, suggesting that these compounds kill the parasite primarily through inhibition of PKG rather than CDPK1. HSP90 was identified as a binding partner of class 2 compounds, and a representative compound bound to the ATP binding site in the N-terminal domain of HSP90. Reducing the size of the gatekeeper residue of CDPK1 enabled inhibition of the enzyme by bumped kinase inhibitors; however, a parasite line expressing the modified enzyme showed no change in sensitivity to these compounds. Taken together, these findings suggest that CDPK1 may not be a suitable target for further inhibitor development and that the primary mechanism through which the imidazopyridazines kill parasites is by inhibition of PKG or HSP90.",

Our study pinpoints the role of structured water molecules in conjoining hotspot residues that govern stability with residues that control selectivity.

The present study examined alterations in stressor-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in rats provided daily access to cocaine for self-administration (SA) under long-access conditions (1.0 mg/kg/infusion; 6 hx14 days). Cocaine self-administering rats displayed reduced basal plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels but showed an augmented restraint-induced percent increase response from baseline compared to saline self-administering controls when measured 24 days after SA testing. This augmented CORT response may have been attributable to impaired glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated feedback regulation of HPA function, since cocaine self-administering rats were also less susceptible to dexamethasone (0.01 mg/kg, i.p.) suppression of plasma CORT levels. GR protein expression measured using Western blot analysis was significantly reduced in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (including the paraventricular nucleus [PVN]) but not in the pituitary gland, ventromedial hypothalamus, dorsal hippocampus, ventral subiculum, medial prefrontal cortex or amygdala in cocaine self-administering rats. Surprisingly, basal corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA or post-restraint increases in CRH mRNA measured at a single (90 min) time-point in the PVN using in situ hybridization did not differ between groups.

The role of each cGMP-binding site in PfPKG activation remains unknown. We have analysed the effect of mutation of each cGMP-binding site (individually and in combination) on PfPKG activation in vitro. The most striking result was that mutation of cGMP site 3 resulted in a 10-49-fold increase in the K (a((cGMP))) value and a 45-55% decrease in maximal activity compared with wild-type. Mutations involving only cGMP-binding sites 1 and 2 had less effect on both the K (a((cGMP))) values and the maximal activities. These results suggest that, although all three cGMP-binding sites are involved in PfPKG activation, cGMP-binding site 3 has the greatest influence on activation. A mutation in the fourth, degenerate cGMP-binding site decreased PfPKG maximal activity by 40%, but did not change the K (a((cGMP))) value for the PfPKG mutant, suggesting that this site does not bind cGMP, but is required for full activation of PfPKG.

One key feature of hydrogen bond networks that makes them difficult to rationally engineer is that they are highly cooperative and are not energetically favorable until the hydrogen bonding potential has been satisfied for all buried polar groups in the network. Existing computational methods for protein design are ill-equipped for creating these highly cooperative networks because they rely on energy functions and sampling strategies that are focused on pairwise interactions. To enable the design of complex hydrogen bond networks, we have developed a new sampling protocol in the molecular modeling program Rosetta that explicitly searches for sets of amino acid mutations that can form self-contained hydrogen bond networks. For a given set of designable residues, the protocol often identifies many alternative sets of mutations/networks, and we show that it can readily be applied to large sets of residues at protein-protein interfaces or in the interior of proteins. The protocol builds on a recently developed method in Rosetta for designing hydrogen bond networks that has been experimentally validated for small symmetric systems but was not extensible to many larger protein structures and complexes. The sampling protocol we describe here not only recapitulates previously validated designs with performance improvements but also yields viable hydrogen bond networks for cases where the previous method fails, such as the design of large, asymmetric interfaces relevant to engineering protein-based therapeutics.",

The application of this paradigm could be accelerated if methods were available for fusing N- and C-terminal domains from newly identified LHEs into chimeric enzymes with hybrid cleavage sites. Here we have analyzed the structural requirements for fusion of domains extracted from six single-chain I-OnuI family LHEs, spanning 40-70% amino acid identity. Our analyses demonstrate that both the LAGLIDADG helical interface residues and the linker peptide composition have important effects on the stability and activity of chimeric enzymes. Using a simple domain fusion method in which linker peptide residues predicted to contact their respective domains are retained, and in which limited variation is introduced into the LAGLIDADG helix and nearby interface residues, catalytically active enzymes were recoverable for ≈ 70% of domain chimeras.

GPCRs can also activate distinct signaling pathways through arrestins. Active states of GPCRs form by small rearrangements of the ligand-binding, or orthosteric, site that are amplified into larger conformational changes. Molecular understanding of the allosteric coupling between ligand binding and G protein or arrestin interaction is emerging from structures of several GPCRs crystallized in inactive and active states, spectroscopic data, and computer simulations.

On the other hand, for the Lyn kinase domain, a non-globular protein with bilobal structure and a large concavity on the surface, implicit solvent does not accurately model solvation to faithfully reproduce partially buried electrostatic interactions and lobe-lobe conformations. Our work reveals that local structure and dynamics of small, globular proteins are modeled well using FACTS and GBMVII. Nonetheless, global conformations and electrostatic interactions in concavities of multi-lobal proteins resulting from simulations with implicit solvent models do not match those obtained from explicit water simulations.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies of the conformations of peptides spanning the length of the alpha-spectrin SH3 domain suggested that SH3 domains lack independently folding substructures. Using a local structure prediction method based on the I-sites library of sequence-structure motifs, we identified a seven residue peptide in the src SH3 domain predicted to adopt a native-like structure, a type II beta-turn bridging unpaired beta-strands, that was not contained intact in any of the SH3 domain peptides studied earlier. NMR characterization confirmed that the isolated peptide, FKKGERL, adopts a structure similar to that adopted in the native protein: the NOE and 3JNHalpha coupling constant patterns were indicative of a type II beta-turn, and NOEs between the Phe and the Leu side-chains suggest that they are juxtaposed as in the prediction and the native structure. These results support the idea that high-confidence I-sites predictions identify protein segments that are likely to form native-like structures early in folding.",

Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'8-has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.",

There are numerous alternative ways of associating individual configurations into collective states, and in deciding on the number of such clustered states there is a trade-off between human interpretability (smaller number of states) and accuracy of representation (larger number of states). Here we introduce a trajectory likelihood measure for assessing alternative discrete state models of protein folding. We find that widely used rmsd-based clustering methods require large numbers of initial states and a second agglomeration step based on kinetic connectivity to produce models with high predictive power; this is the approach taken in elegant recent work with Markov State Models of protein folding. In contrast, we find that grouping of states based on secondary structure pairings or contact maps, when refined with K-means clustering, yields higher likelihood models with many fewer states. Using the most predictive contact map representation to study the folding transitions of the WW domain in very long molecular dynamics simulations, we identify new states and transitions. The methods should be generally useful for investigating the structural transitions in protein folding simulations for larger proteins.",

Here, we test experimentally the robustness of the src SH3-domain folding transition state to changes in topology by covalently constraining regions of the protein with disulfide crosslinks and then performing kinetic analysis on point mutations in the context of these modified proteins. Circularization (crosslinking the N and C termini) of the src SH3 domain makes the protein topologically symmetric and causes delocalization of structure in the transition state ensemble suggesting a change in the folding mechanism. In contrast, crosslinking a single structural element (the distal beta-hairpin) which is an essential part of the transition state, results in a protein that folds 30 times faster, but does not change the distribution of structure in the transition state. As the transition states of distantly related SH3 domains were previously found to be very similar, we conclude that the free energy landscape of this protein family contains deep features which are relatively insensitive to sequence variations but can be altered by changes in topology.",

Entropy maximization is also beset by multiple false solutions: electron-density maps are readily generated which satisfy the same Fourier amplitude constraints but have higher entropies than the true solution. We conclude that a successful ab initio approach must make use of high-resolution Fourier data and/or stronger chemical constraints. One such constraint is the connectivity of the macromolecule.

We show that by extending RFdiffusion8 to enable binder design to flexible targets, and to refining input structure models by successive noising and denoising (partial diffusion), picomolar-affinity binders can be generated to helical peptide targets by either refining designs generated with other methods, or completely de novo starting from random noise distributions without any subsequent experimental optimization. The RFdiffusion designs enable the enrichment and subsequent detection of parathyroid hormone and glucagon by mass spectrometry, and the construction of bioluminescence-based protein biosensors.

In rats, daily retrieval of drug-associated memories 10 minutes or 1 hour but not 6 hours before extinction sessions attenuated drug-induced reinstatement, spontaneous recovery, and renewal of conditioned drug effects and drug seeking.

Residual stresses as high as 10 MPa were observed in the cement mantle. Residual stresses of this magnitude are potentially high enough to initiate damage within the cement mantle or at the stem/cement interface immediately post-implantation.

These guidelines, which are based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a foundation for the delivery of quality cardiovascular care. The ACC and AHA sponsor the development and publication of clinical practice guidelines without commercial support, and members volunteer their time to the writing and review efforts. Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but these guidelines are relevant to patients throughout the world. Although guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and align with patients’ interests. Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances, and should not replace clinical judgment. Recommendations for guideline-directed management and therapy, which encompasses clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, and both pharmacological and procedural treatments, are effective only when followed by both practitioners and patients. Adherence to recommendations can be enhanced by shared decision-making between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities. The ACC/AHA Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines strives to ensure that the guideline writing committee both contains requisite expertise and is representative of the broader medical community by selecting experts from a broad array of backgrounds, representing different geographic regions, sexes, races, ethnicities, intellectual perspectives/biases, and scopes of clinical practice, and by inviting organizations and professional societies with related interests and expertise to participate as partners or collaborators. The ACC and AHA have rigorous policies and methods to ensure that documents are developed without bias or improper influence. The complete policy on relationships with industry and other entities (RWI) can be found online. Beginning in 2017, numerous modifications to the guidelines have been and continue to be implemented to make guidelines shorter and enhance “user friendliness.” Guidelines are written and presented in a modular knowledge chunk format, in which each chunk includes a table of recommendations, a brief synopsis, recommendation-specific supportive text and, when appropriate, flow diagrams or additional tables. Hyperlinked references are provided for each modular knowledge chunk to facilitate quick access and review. More structured guidelines–including word limits (“targets”) and a web guideline supplement for useful but noncritical tables and figures–are 2 such changes. This Preamble is an abbreviated version, with the detailed version available online. The reader is encouraged to consult the full-text guideline for additional guidance and details, since the executive summary contains mainly the recommendations.",

Thus, research focuses on developing catalytic bioscavengers as an alternative approach using OP-hydrolyzing enzymes such as Brevundimonas diminuta phosphotriesterase (PTE). Recently, a PTE mutant dubbed C23 was engineered, exhibiting reversed stereoselectivity and high catalytic efficiency (k cat/K M) for the hydrolysis of the toxic enantiomers of VX, CVX, and VR. Additionally, C23's ability to prevent systemic toxicity of VX using a low protein dose has been shown in vivo. In this study, the catalytic efficiencies of V-agent hydrolysis by two newly selected PTE variants were determined. Moreover, in order to establish trends in sequence-activity relationships along the pathway of PTE's laboratory evolution, we examined k cat/K M values of several variants with a number of V-type and G-type nerve agents as well as with different OP pesticides. Although none of the new PTE variants exhibited k cat/K M values >107 M-1 min-1 with V-type nerve agents, which is required for effective prophylaxis, they were improved with VR relative to previously evolved variants.

        "abstract": "A high-quality genome sequence of any model organism is an essential starting point for genetic and other studies. Older clone-based methods are slow and expensive, whereas faster, cheaper short-read-only assemblies can be incomplete and highly fragmented, which minimizes their usefulness. The last few years have seen the introduction of many new technologies for genome assembly. These new technologies and associated new algorithms are typically benchmarked on microbial genomes or, if they scale appropriately, on larger (e.g., human) genomes. However, plant genomes can be much more repetitive and larger than the human genome, and plant biochemistry often makes obtaining high-quality DNA that is free from contaminants difficult. Reflecting their challenging nature, we observe that plant genome assembly statistics are typically poorer than for vertebrates.",

We have investigated the kinetic role of the computationally designed residues and further characterized the enzyme's product profile.

Mass spectrometry revealed that the engineered enzyme produces two products of the formose reaction-dihydroxyacetone and glycolaldehyde-with the product profile dependent on the formaldehyde concentration. We further explored the effects of this product profile on the thermodynamics and yield of the overall carbon assimilation from the formolase pathway to help guide future efforts to engineer this pathway.",

Here we describe a method that allows robust modeling of protein structures of up to 225 residues by combining (1)H(N), (13)C, and (15)N backbone and (13)Cβ chemical shift data, distance restraints derived from homologous structures, and a physically realistic all-atom energy function. Accurate models are distinguished from inaccurate models generated using incorrect sequence alignments by requiring that (i) the all-atom energies of models generated using the restraints are lower than models generated in unrestrained calculations and (ii) the low-energy structures converge to within 2.0 Å backbone rmsd over 75% of the protein. Benchmark calculations on known structures and blind targets show that the method can accurately model protein structures, even with very remote homology information, to a backbone rmsd of 1.2-1.9 Å relative to the conventional determined NMR ensembles and of 0.9-1.6 Å relative to X-ray structures for well-defined regions of the protein structures. This approach facilitates the accurate modeling of protein structures using backbone chemical shift data without need for side-chain resonance assignments and extensive analysis of NOESY cross-peak assignments.",

The method takes advantage of the \"atom-tree\" representation of molecular systems and modular architecture of the Rosetta3 software suite to incorporate explicit metal ion coordination geometry into previously developed de novo prediction and loop modeling protocols. Zinc cofactors are tethered to their interacting residues based on coordination geometries observed in natural zinc-binding proteins. The incorporation of explicit zinc atoms and their coordination geometry in both de novo structure prediction and loop modeling significantly improves sampling near the native conformation. The method can be readily extended to predict protein structures bound to other metal and/or small chemical cofactors with well-defined coordination or ligation geometry.",

We used computational protein design to generate protein models with binding sites for 17-OHP containing an extended, nonpolar, shape-complementary binding pocket for the four-ring core of the compound, and hydrogen bonding residues at the base of the pocket to interact with carbonyl and hydroxyl groups at the more polar end of the ligand. Eight of 16 designed proteins experimentally tested bind 17-OHP with micromolar affinity. A co-crystal structure of one of the designs revealed that 17-OHP is rotated 180° around a pseudo-two-fold axis in the compound and displays multiple binding modes within the pocket, while still interacting with all of the designed residues in the engineered site. Subsequent rounds of mutagenesis and binding selection improved the ligand affinity to nanomolar range, while appearing to constrain the ligand to a single bound conformation that maintains the same \"flipped\" orientation relative to the original design. We trace the discrepancy in the design calculations to two sources: first, a failure to model subtle backbone changes which alter the distribution of sidechain rotameric states and second, an underestimation of the energetic cost of desolvating the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups of the ligand. The difference between design model and crystal structure thus arises from both sampling limitations and energy function inaccuracies that are exacerbated by the near two-fold symmetry of the molecule.",

This process is typically guided by a knowledge‐based energy function and uses a heuristic optimization method. The fragments play two important roles in this process: they define the set of structural parameters available, and they also assume the role of the main variation operators that are used by the optimiser. Previous analysis has typically focused on the first of these roles. In particular, the relationship between local amino acid sequence and local protein structure has been studied by a range of authors. The correlation between the two has been shown to vary with the window length considered, and the results of these analyses have informed directly the choice of fragment length in state‐of‐the‐art prediction techniques. Here, we focus on the second role of fragments and aim to determine the effect of fragment length from an optimization perspective. We use theoretical analyses to reveal how the size and structure of the search space changes as a function of insertion length. Furthermore, empirical analyses are used to explore additional ways in which the size of the fragment insertion influences the search both in a simulation model and for the fragment‐assembly technique, Rosetta.

        "abstract": "hosphatases play a critical role in the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle and signal transduction. A putative protein serine/threonine phosphatase gene has been isolated from the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The gene has an unusual intron that contains four repeats of 32 nucleotides and displays a high degree of size polymorphism among different strains of P. falciparum. The open reading frame reconstituted by removal of the intron encodes a protein of 466 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 53.7 kDa. The encoded protein, termed protein phosphatase beta (PP-beta), is composed of two distinct domains. The C-terminal domain comprises 315 amino acids and exhibits a striking similarity to the catalytic subunits of the type-2A protein phosphatases. Database searches revealed that the catalytic domain has the highest similarity to Schizosaccharomyces pombe Ppa1 (58% identity and 73% similarity). However, it contains a hydrophilic insert consisting of five amino acids. The N-terminal domain comprises 151 amino acid residues and exhibits several striking features, including high levels of charged amino acids and asparagine, and multiple consensus phosphorylation sites for a number of protein kinases. An overall structural comparison of PP-beta with other members of the protein phosphatase 2A group revealed that PP-beta is more closely related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPH22. Southern blots of genomic DNA digests and chromosomal separations showed that PP-beta is a single-copy gene and is located on chromosome 9. A 2800-nucleotide transcript of this gene is expressed specifically in the sexual erythrocytic stage (gametocytes). The results indicate that PP-beta may be involved in sexual stage development.",

Tumor cells often take advantage of this pathway by overexpressing the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 to evade destruction by the immune system. Alternatively, if there is a decrease in function of the PD-1 pathway, unchecked activation of the immune system and autoimmunity can result. Using a combination of computation and experiment, we designed a hyperstable 40-residue miniprotein, PD-MP1, that specifically binds murine and human PD-1 at the PD-L1 interface with a Kd of ∼100 nM. The apo crystal structure shows that the binder folds as designed with a backbone RMSD of 1.3 Å to the design model. Trimerization of PD-MP1 resulted in a PD-1 agonist that strongly inhibits murine T cell activation. This small, hyperstable PD-1 binding protein was computationally designed with an all-beta interface, and the trimeric agonist could contribute to treatments for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.",

We describe a computationally designed protein that tightly binds EED and disrupts PRC2 function in both cancer and stem cells. Expression of the binder at different stem cell stages identifies the first critical repressive H3K27me3 mark in embryonic development. The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) histone methyltransferase plays a central role in epigenetic regulation in development and in cancer, and hence to interrogate its role in a specific developmental transition, methods are needed for disrupting function of the complex with high temporal and spatial precision. The catalytic and substrate recognition functions of PRC2 are coupled by binding of the N-terminal helix of the Ezh2 methylase to an extended groove on the EED trimethyl lysine binding subunit. Disrupting PRC2 function can in principle be achieved by blocking this single interaction, but there are few approaches for blocking specific protein–protein interactions in living cells and organisms. Here, we describe the computational design of proteins that bind to the EZH2 interaction site on EED with subnanomolar affinity in vitro and form tight and specific complexes with EED in living cells. Induction of the EED binding proteins abolishes H3K27 methylation in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and at all but the earliest stage blocks self-renewal, pinpointing the first critical repressive H3K27me3 marks in development.",

An activity from HeLa cells that removes 5-hydroxymethyluracil (HmU) from DNA has been partially purified and characterized using a battery of oligonucleotides containing modified bases. This partially purified activity preferentially removes HmU mispaired with guanine. The HmU repair activity also acts on uracil and fluorouracil but not 5-substituted uracil derivatives with halogens larger than fluorine. However, neither mispaired thymine nor ethenocytosine are substrates. HmU is readily removed when paired with guanine, hypoxanthine (deoxyinosine), and purine (deoxynebularine), but not from single-stranded substrates. Upon the basis of these substrate preferences, we conclude that (1) the mispaired HmU repair activity is distinct from previously reported glycosylases including UDG, TDG, MUG, and SMUG1 activities, (2) the binding pocket is highly selective for the 5-hydroxymethyl group, and (3) the preference for mispaired HmU derives from reduced thermal stability of the mispair, as opposed to selective recognition of the mispaired guanine residue in the opposing DNA strand.",

In the UK, the initial peak was in April 2020; in the county of Norfolk (UK) and surrounding areas, which has a stable, low-density population, over 3200 cases were reported between March and August 2020. As part of the activities of the national COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK) we undertook whole genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in positive clinical samples from the Norfolk region. These samples were collected by four major hospitals, multiple minor hospitals, care facilities and community organizations within Norfolk and surrounding areas. We combined clinical metadata with the sequencing data from regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes to understand the origins, genetic variation, transmission and expansion (spread) of the virus within the region and provide context nationally. Data were fed back into the national effort for pandemic management, whilst simultaneously being used to assist local outbreak analyses. Overall, 1565 positive samples (172 per 100 000 population) from 1376 cases were evaluated; for 140 cases between two and six samples were available providing longitudinal data. This represented 42.6 % of all positive samples identified by hospital testing in the region and encompassed those with clinical need, and health and care workers and their families. In total, 1035 cases had genome sequences of sufficient quality to provide phylogenetic lineages. These genomes belonged to 26 distinct global lineages, indicating that there were multiple separate introductions into the region. Furthermore, 100 genetically distinct UK lineages were detected demonstrating local evolution, at a rate of ~2 SNPs per month, and multiple co-occurring lineages as the pandemic progressed. Our analysis: identified a discrete sublineage associated with six care facilities; found no evidence of reinfection in longitudinal samples; ruled out a nosocomial outbreak; identified 16 lineages in key workers which were not in patients, indicating infection control measures were effective; and found the D614G spike protein mutation which is linked to increased transmissibility dominates the samples and rapidly confirmed relatedness of cases in an outbreak at a food processing facility. The large-scale genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples has provided valuable additional data for public health epidemiology in the Norfolk region, and will continue to help identify and untangle hidden transmission chains as the pandemic evolves.",

In the recent rounds of CAPRI (6-12), large backbone conformational changes occur upon binding for several target complexes. To address these challenges, we explicitly introduced backbone flexibility in our modeling procedures by combining rigid-body docking with protein structure prediction techniques such as modeling variable loops and building homology models. Encouragingly, using this approach we were able to correctly predict a significant backbone conformational change of an interface loop for Target 20 (12 A rmsd between those in the unbound monomer and complex structures), but accounting for backbone flexibility in protein-protein docking is still very challenging because of the significantly larger conformational space, which must be surveyed.

Conditional gene disruption causes a profound reduction in invasion of erythrocytes and rapid death of those merozoites that invade. We show that this dual phenotype results from elevated cAMP levels and hyperactivation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Phosphoproteomic analysis of PDEβ-null parasites reveals a >2-fold increase in phosphorylation at over 200 phosphosites, more than half of which conform to a PKA substrate consensus sequence.

International arrivals and domestic travelers have increased over the last\ndecade. However, for as many historical landmarks, amazing nightlife scenes, and striking landscapes there are to take in, oftentimes that also means major urban centers can have their share of crime, which can result in tourists becoming victims of crime. These paper objectives are to assess the effects of crime\non health and the relationship between the number of visitors and the types and patterns of crimes, over time, in two cities engaged in mass tourism. A quantitative methodology was utilized to analyze thirteen years of crime data from the US Federal Bureau of Investigations. Based on the data, this research by itself, cannot adequately explain the variations in violent crime rates of either of the two cities. The results of the Pearson�s product-moment correlation coefficient showed the tourist city of Honolulu with an inverse relationship between the number of visitors and violent crimes while Las Vegas results showed\nsignificant correlation between the number of visitors and crime. The results also showed relationships between increasing law enforcement employees and crime reduction. These results could assist these and other cities in studying more distinctively the relationship between crime and tourism as well as the\nlocalization of crimes on visitors in order to engage in measurement and prevention efforts which would serve visitors as well as residents.",

In this study, we have examined the effects of ras upon haemopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation, using two human cell lines which represent different stages of haemopoietic cell maturation. When a mutant H12-ras gene (codon 12: gly-->asp) was expressed in the monoblastic cell line, U937, marked inhibition of growth was seen together with morphological, functional and immunophenotypic evidence of monocytic maturation. Infection of U937 cells with a c-myc retrovirus produced similar changes strongly suggesting that Myc plays an important role in this action of Ras. By contrast, expression of H12-ras promoted factor-independent growth of the multipotent cell line, TF-1. Furthermore, mutant ras dramatically enhanced the growth of TF-1 cells in the presence of added GM-CSF or erythropoietin, but did not influence the state of differentiation of these cells. These data clearly indicate that in haemopoietic cells, Ras may promote either proliferation or differentiation depending upon cell type and/or state of maturation.",

During the first survey, we analyzed 166 samples representing 14 types of fish and 5 other types of seafood. An overall prevalence of 21.7% was found. Thirty-three samples (19.9%) harbored C. botulinum type A, 4 (2.4%) type B, 1 (0.6%) type E, and 1 sample (0.6%) type F. The most probable number (MPN) for C. botulinum in Pacific rockfish (red snapper) and salmon ranged from 9-240 and 3-120 organisms/100 g, respectively, in selected samples. The second survey examined 54 samples of fresh fillets representing 15 types of fish. Seventy grams of homogenate were vacuum packaged and incubated at 30°C for 3 d. Of the 54 samples, 36 (66.7%) resulted in toxin production. Of these 36 samples, 18 had type A C. botulinum , 8 type E, 4 nonproteolytic (np) type B, 2 proteolytic type B, 1 type F (np), and 3 harbored both type A and E organisms. When duplicate samples of each homogenate were incubated at 12°C for 8 d and at 8°C for 14 and 28 d, seven more samples initially shown at 30°C to harbor only one type of C. botulinum revealed the presence of a second type (4 had type E and 3 had B [np]). The high prevalence of nonproteolytic spore types is of particular significance when considering the risk of C. botulinum growth in fresh and minimally processed seafood stored for extended times under modified atmospheres at low temperatures.",

        "abstract": "nce Despite considerable advances in de novo protein design in recent years, it still remains challenging to engineer proteins with large internal cavities that can be functionalized to become biotechnological tools, such as specific binders, sensors, or catalysts. In this work, we outline a computational strategy to combine multiple de novo designed domains into symmetric protein assemblies that enclose large internal chambers. The high stability of de novo scaffolds enables ready functionalization of these chambers; for instance, with specific metal-binding sites, as demonstrated here by generating a lanthanide-binding protein with ultra-high affinity. De novo protein design has succeeded in generating a large variety of globular proteins, but the construction of protein scaffolds with cavities that could accommodate large signaling molecules, cofactors, and substrates remains an outstanding challenge. The long, often flexible loops that form such cavities in many natural proteins are difficult to precisely program and thus challenging for computational protein design. Here we describe an alternative approach to this problem. We fused two stable proteins with C2 symmetry—a de novo designed dimeric ferredoxin fold and a de novo designed TIM barrel—such that their symmetry axes are aligned to create scaffolds with large cavities that can serve as binding pockets or enzymatic reaction chambers. The crystal structures of two such designs confirm the presence of a 420 cubic Ångström chamber defined by the top of the designed TIM barrel and the bottom of the ferredoxin dimer. We functionalized the scaffold by installing a metal-binding site consisting of four glutamate residues close to the symmetry axis. The protein binds lanthanide ions with very high affinity as demonstrated by tryptophan-enhanced terbium luminescence. This approach can be extended to other metals and cofactors, making this scaffold a modular platform for the design of binding proteins and biocatalysts.",

The algorithm is based on a hierarchical workflow and can be parallelized on supercomputers with up to 128,000 compute cores with near perfect efficiency. Such scaling behavior is notable, as with Moore's law continuing only in the number of cores per chip, parallelizability is a critical property of new algorithms.

T3SSs span both membranes of Gram-negative bacteria by forming a structure of connected oligomeric rings termed the needle complex (NC). Here, the localization of subunits in the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium T3SS NC were probed via mass spectrometry-assisted identification of chemical cross-links in intact NC preparations. Cross-links between amino acids near the amino terminus of the outer membrane ring component InvG and the carboxyl terminus of the inner membrane ring component PrgH and between the two inner membrane components PrgH and PrgK allowed for spatial localization of the three ring components within the electron density map structures of NCs. Mutational and biochemical analysis demonstrated that the amino terminus of InvG and the carboxyl terminus of PrgH play a critical role in the assembly and function of the T3SS apparatus. Analysis of an InvG mutant indicates that the structure of the InvG oligomer can affect the switching of the T3SS substrate to translocon and effector components.

The final enzyme in the synthesis of this phosphoinositide, a Type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K), is activated by the small G protein ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1). In mammals, the ARF-PIP5K pathway is a key regulator of cell motility, secretion and cell signalling. We report the characterisation of a unique, putative bifunctional PIP5K in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The protein comprises a C-terminal, functional PIP5K domain with catalytic specificity for phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. The recombinant enzyme is activated by ARF1 but not phosphatidic acid. The protein also incorporates an unusual N-terminal domain with potential helix-loop-helix EF-hand-like motifs that is a member of the neuronal calcium sensor family (NCS). Intriguingly, NCS-1 has been shown to stimulate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate synthesis by activating mammalian and yeast phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta in vitro in a calcium-dependent manner. The unexpected physical attachment of an NCS-like domain to the plasmodial PIP5K might reflect a unique functional link between the calcium and PtdIns(4,5)P(2) pathways allowing modulation of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) production in response to changes in intracellular calcium concentrations within the parasite.",

Im proteins are broadly cross-reactive yet specific inhibitors binding cognate and non-cognate DNases with K(d) values that vary between 10(-4) and 10(-14) M, characteristics that are explained by a 'dual-recognition' mechanism. In this work, we addressed for the first time the energetics of Im protein recognition by colicin DNases through a combination of E9 DNase alanine scanning and double-mutant cycles (DMCs) coupled with kinetic and calorimetric analyses of cognate Im9 and non-cognate Im2 binding, as well as computational analysis of alanine scanning and DMC data. We show that differential DeltaDeltaGs observed for four E9 DNase residues cumulatively distinguish cognate Im9 association from non-cognate Im2 association. E9 DNase Phe86 is the primary specificity hotspot residue in the centre of the interface, which is coordinated by conserved and variable hotspot residues of the cognate Im protein. Experimental DMC analysis reveals that only modest coupling energies to Im9 residues are observed, in agreement with calculated DMCs using the program ROSETTA and consistent with the largely hydrophobic nature of E9 DNase-Im9 specificity contacts. Computed values for the 12 E9 DNase alanine mutants showed reasonable agreement with experimental DeltaDeltaG data, particularly for interactions not mediated by interfacial water molecules. DeltaDeltaG predictions for residues that contact buried water molecules calculated using solvated rotamer models met with mixed success; however, we were able to predict with a high degree of accuracy the location and energetic contribution of one such contact. Our study highlights how colicin DNases are able to utilise both conserved and variable amino acids to distinguish cognate from non-cognate Im proteins, with the energetic contributions of the conserved residues modulated by neighbouring specificity sites.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the genetic basis for a phenotype is a central goal in biological research. Much has been learnt about bacterial genomes by creating large mutant libraries and looking for conditionally important genes. However, current genome-wide methods are largely unable to assay essential genes which are not amenable to disruption. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new version of \"TraDIS\" (transposon directed insertion-site sequencing) that we term \"TraDIS-Xpress\" that combines an inducible promoter into the transposon cassette. This allows controlled overexpression and repression of all genes owing to saturation of inserts adjacent to all open reading frames as well as conventional inactivation. We applied TraDIS-Xpress to identify responses to the biocide triclosan across a range of concentrations. Triclosan is endemic in modern life, but there is uncertainty about its mode of action with a concentration-dependent switch from bacteriostatic to bactericidal action unexplained. Our results show a concentration-dependent response to triclosan with different genes important in survival between static and cidal exposures. These genes include those previously reported to have a role in triclosan resistance as well as a new set of genes, including essential genes. Novel genes identified as being sensitive to triclosan exposure include those involved in barrier function, small molecule uptake, and integrity of transcription and translation. We anticipate the approach we show here, by allowing comparisons across multiple experimental conditions of TraDIS data, and including essential genes, will be a starting point for future work examining how different drug conditions impact bacterial survival mechanisms.",

However, the resulting coarse-grained sampling of possible side-chain terminal positions is problematic for the design of protein function, which depends on precise positioning of side-chain atoms. Although backbone flexibility can greatly increase the conformation freedom of side-chain functional groups, it is not obvious which backbone movements will generate the critical constellation of atoms responsible for protein function. Here, we report an automated method for identifying protein backbone movements that can give rise to any specified set of desired side-chain atomic placements and interactions, using protein-DNA interfaces as a model system. We use a library of previously observed protein-DNA interactions (motifs) and a rotamer-based description of side-chain conformation freedom to identify placements for the protein backbone that can give rise to a favorable side-chain interaction with DNA. We describe a tree-search algorithm for identifying those combinations of interactions from the library that can be realized with minimal perturbation of the protein backbone.

        "abstract": "Cell proliferation and differentiation are governed by a finely controlled balance between repression and activation of gene expression. The vertebrate Ets transcriptional repressor Tel (ETV6) and its invertebrate orthologue Yan, play pivotal roles in cell fate determination although the precise mechanisms by which repression of gene expression by these factors is achieved are not clearly defined. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the primary site of sumoylation of Tel, lysine 11 (K11), which is highly conserved in vertebrates (except Danio rerio). We demonstrate that in cells PIAS3 binds to Tel and stimulates sumoylation of K11 in the nucleus. Both Tel monomers and oligomers are efficiently sumoylated on K11 in vitro; but in cells only Tel oligomers are found conjugated with SUMO, whereas sumoylation of Tel monomers is transitory and appears to sensitize them for proteasomal degradation. Mechanistically, sumoylation of K11 inhibits repression of gene expression by full-length Tel. In accordance with this observation, we found that sumoylation impedes Tel association with DNA. By contrast, a Tel isoform lacking K11 (TelM43) is strongly repressive. This isoform results from translation from an alternative initiation codon (M43) that is common to all Tel proteins that also contain the K11 sumoylation consensus site. We find that PIAS3 may have a dual, context-dependent influence on Tel; it mediates Tel sumoylation, but it also augments Tel's repressive function in a sumoylation-independent fashion. Our data support a model that suggests that PIAS-mediated sumoylation of K11 and the emergence of TelM43 in early vertebrates are linked and that this serves to refine spatiotemporal control of gene expression by Tel by establishing a pool of Tel molecules that are available either to be recycled to reinforce repression of gene expression or are degraded in a regulated fashion.",

We studied the folding behavior of src SH3 at various conditions by circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence, and X-ray solution scattering methods. On the src SH3 folding pathway, an alpha-helix-rich intermediate appeared not only at subzero temperatures but also above 0 degrees C. The fraction of alpha-helix in the kinetically observed intermediate is ca. 26% based on the kinetic CD experiment. X-ray solution scattering revealed that the intermediate was compact but not fully packed. The analysis of CD implies that the amplitude of the burst phase is proportional to the helical fraction calculated according to the helix-coil transition theory. This strongly suggests that the initial folding core is formed by the collapse of much less stably existing alpha-helices.",

        "abstract": "General approaches for designing sequence-specific peptide-binding proteins would have wide utility in proteomics and synthetic biology. However, designing peptide-binding proteins is challenging, as most peptides do not have defined structures in isolation, and hydrogen bonds must be made to the buried polar groups in the peptide backbone1-3. Here, inspired by natural and re-engineered protein-peptide systems4-11, we set out to design proteins made out of repeating units that bind peptides with repeating sequences, with a one-to-one correspondence between the repeat units of the protein and those of the peptide. We use geometric hashing to identify protein backbones and peptide-docking arrangements that are compatible with bidentate hydrogen bonds between the side chains of the protein and the peptide backbone12. The remainder of the protein sequence is then optimized for folding and peptide binding. We design repeat proteins to bind to six different tripeptide-repeat sequences in polyproline II conformations. The proteins are hyperstable and bind to four to six tandem repeats of their tripeptide targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities in vitro and in living cells. Crystal structures reveal repeating interactions between protein and peptide interactions as designed, including ladders of hydrogen bonds from protein side chains to peptide backbones. By redesigning the binding interfaces of individual repeat units, specificity can be achieved for non-repeating peptide sequences and for disordered regions of native proteins.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale human genetic data1-3 have shown that cancer mutations display strong tissue-selectivity, but how this selectivity arises remains unclear. Here, using experimental models, functional genomics and analyses of patient samples, we demonstrate that the lineage transcription factor paired box 8 (PAX8) is required for oncogenic signalling by two common genetic alterations that cause clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) in humans: the germline variant rs7948643 at 11q13.3 and somatic inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor (VHL)4-6. VHL loss, which is observed in about 90% of ccRCCs, can lead to hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2A) stabilization6,7. We show that HIF2A is preferentially recruited to PAX8-bound transcriptional enhancers, including a pro-tumorigenic cyclin D1 (CCND1) enhancer that is controlled by PAX8 and HIF2A. The ccRCC-protective allele C at rs7948643 inhibits PAX8 binding at this enhancer and downstream activation of CCND1 expression. Co-option of a PAX8-dependent physiological programme that supports the proliferation of normal renal epithelial cells is also required for MYC expression from the ccRCC metastasis-associated amplicons at 8q21.3-q24.3 (ref. 8). These results demonstrate that transcriptional lineage factors are essential for oncogenic signalling and that they mediate tissue-specific cancer risk associated with somatic and inherited genetic variants.",

Repeat proteins are computationally docked against a functionally relevant region of the target protein surface that varies in the different subtypes, and the interface sequences are optimized for affinity and specificity first computationally and then experimentally. We used this approach to generate a series of human Frizzled (Fz) subtype-selective antagonists with extensive shape complementary interaction surfaces considerably larger than those of repeat proteins selected from random libraries.

Intraerythrocytic stages efficiently trigger Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell activation and degranulation through poorly understood mechanisms. P. falciparum blood-stage extracts are known to contain phosphoantigens able to stimulate Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, but how these are presented by intact infected red blood cells (iRBCs) remains elusive. Here we show that, unlike activation by phosphoantigen-expressing cells, Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell activation by intact iRBCs is independent of butyrophilin expression by the iRBC, and contact with an intact iRBC is not required. Moreover, blood-stage culture supernatants proved to be as potent activators of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells as iRBCs. Bioactivity in the microenvironment is attributable to phosphoantigens, as it is dependent on the parasite DOXP pathway, on Vγ9Vδ2 TCR signaling, and on butyrophilin expression by Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. Kinetic studies showed that the phosphoantigens were released at the end of the intraerythrocytic cycle at the time of parasite egress. We document exquisite sensitivity of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, which respond to a few thousand parasites. These data unravel a novel framework, whereby release of phosphoantigens into the extracellular milieu by sequestered parasites likely promotes activation of distant Vγ9Vδ2 T cells that in turn exert remote antiparasitic functions.",

        "abstract": "d: Examining the beliefs about fast food and health, especially the consequences of fast food intake (FFI) on health, among college students will be a crucial factor in turning the tide on current morbidity and mortality statistics. Purpose: This article examines the results of a survey among Midwestern college-aged students about their fast food restaurant menu item selection and how they perceive that these choices are affecting their health as a means to direct university curriculum. Methods: Researchers used SurveyMonkey to disseminate a questionnaire to currently enrolled college students from 3 area tertiary educational institutions. The survey was analyzed using SPSS for mean, standard deviation, and chi-square. Results: Statistical differences were found between male (N = 110) and female (N = 389) college students in terms of number of fast food visits (P = 0.032), consumption of diet soda (P = 0.009), consumption of hamburgers (P = 0.000), and what is considered harmful FFI (P = 0.032; effect size for all results was very small, η2 = 0.02). Discussion: This study indicates some gender differences between college students' fast food menu choices; that is, more males than females consume fast food, feel that hamburgers are not harmful, and consume less diet soda. Translation to Health Education Practice: The results indicate less fast food consumption among this population than hypothesized but supported previous research in terms of gender and FFI. Health educators may have successfully emphasized the deleterious consequences of fast food such that actual consumption is being underreported or this population has lower fast food consumption compared to other geographic locations. With the increasing emergence of televised cooking, health educators may want to fashion nutrition information around wholesome raw ingredients and organic methods to promote positive food choices among all age groups.",

        "abstract": "Several all-helical single-domain proteins have been shown to fold rapidly (microsecond time scale) to a compact intermediate state and subsequently rearrange more slowly to the native conformation. An understanding of this process has been hindered by difficulties in experimental studies of intermediates in cases where they are both low-populated and only transiently formed. One such example is provided by the on-pathway folding intermediate of the small four-helix bundle FF domain from HYPA/FBP11 that is populated at several percent with a millisecond lifetime at room temperature. Here we have studied the L24A mutant that has been shown previously to form nonnative interactions in the folding transition state. A suite of Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill relaxation dispersion NMR experiments have been used to measure backbone chemical shifts and amide bond vector orientations of the invisible folding intermediate that form the input restraints in calculations of atomic resolution models of its structure. Despite the fact that the intermediate structure has many features that are similar to that of the native state, a set of nonnative contacts is observed that is even more extensive than noted previously for the wild-type (WT) folding intermediate. Such nonnative interactions, which must be broken prior to adoption of the native conformation, explain why the transition from the intermediate state to the native conformer (millisecond time scale) is significantly slower than from the unfolded ensemble to the intermediate and why the L24A mutant folds more slowly than the WT.",

In cattle slaughterhouses, aerobic viable counts were measured by sponging the brisket at the end of the line to determine whether the slaughterhouse air had led to contamination of the carcasses. Furthermore, a replica cattle carcass with settle plates attached was exposed to similar conditions. The greatest contamination of the plates occurred at the hide puller (P < 0.01). The use of ultraclean air reduced the deposition of organisms onto settle plates (P < 0.01). The airborne route contributed to contamination in cattle slaughterhouses, but other vectors were more important. Further study of contamination of the brisket, at the time that it was first exposed, showed that knives transfer contamination from the hide. The use of ultraclean air at this position showed that the airborne route was a contributor to contamination (P < 0.1), but it was not the greatest vector. In lamb slaughterhouses, the highest counts on settle plates were found at the fleece puller (P < 0.05). The highest counts on the lamb carcasses were found on the brisket exposed from the start of the line to just after the fleece puller (P < 0.05). There was no clear relationship between the measured counts and the concentration of organisms in the air, indicating that the airborne route in lamb slaughterhouses contributes less to carcass contamination than do the surface contacts.",

        "abstract": "nding challenge in protein design is the design of binders against therapeutically relevant target proteins via scaffolding the discontinuous binding interfaces present in their often large and complex binding partners. There is currently no method for sampling through the almost unlimited number of possible protein structures for those capable of scaffolding a specified discontinuous functional site; instead, current approaches make the sampling problem tractable by restricting search to structures composed of pre-defined secondary structural elements. Such restriction of search has the disadvantage that considerable trial and error can be required to identify architectures capable of scaffolding an arbitrary discontinuous functional site, and only a tiny fraction of possible architectures can be explored. Here we build on recent advances in de novo protein design by deep network hallucination to develop a solution to this problem which eliminates the need to pre-specify the structure of the scaffolding in any way. We use the trRosetta residual neural network, which maps input sequences to predicted inter-residue distances and orientations, to compute a loss function which simultaneously rewards recapitulation of a desired structural motif and the ideality of the surrounding scaffold, and generate diverse structures harboring the desired binding interface by optimizing this loss function by gradient descent. We illustrate the power and versatility of the method by scaffolding binding sites from proteins involved in key signaling pathways with a wide range of secondary structure compositions and geometries. The method should be broadly useful for designing small stable proteins containing complex functional sites.",

Cystine is intracellularly reduced to cysteine, a building block of GSH. As such, system xc(-) can regulate the antioxidant capacity of cells. Moreover, in several brain regions, system xc(-) is the major source of extracellular glutamate. As such this antiporter is able to fulfill key physiological functions in the CNS, while evidence indicates it also plays a role in certain brain pathologies. Since the transcription of xCT, the specific subunit of system xc(-), is enhanced by the presence of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines, system xc(-) could be involved in toxic extracellular glutamate release in neurological disorders that are associated with increased oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. System xc(-) has also been reported to contribute to the invasiveness of brain tumors and, as a source of extracellular glutamate, could participate in the induction of peritumoral seizures. Two independent reviews (Pharmacol. Rev. 64, 2012, 780; Antioxid. Redox Signal. 18, 2013, 522), approached from a different perspective, have recently been published on the functions of system xc(-) in the CNS. In this review, we highlight novel achievements and insights covering the regulation of system xc(-) as well as its involvement in emotional behavior, cognition, addiction, neurological disorders and glioblastomas, acquired in the past few years. System xc(-) constitutes an important source of extrasynaptic glutamate in the brain. By modulating the tone of extrasynaptic metabotropic or ionotropic glutamate receptors, it affects excitatory neurotransmission, the threshold for overexcitation and excitotoxicity and, as a consequence, behavior. This review describes the current knowledge of how system xc(-) is regulated and involved in physiological as well as pathophysiological brain functioning.",

Phosphoproteomic analyses reveal multiple ICM1 phosphorylation events dependent on PKG activity. Stage-specific depletion of Plasmodium berghei ICM1 prevents gametogenesis due to a block in intracellular calcium mobilization, while conditional loss of Plasmodium falciparum ICM1 is detrimental for the parasite resulting in severely reduced calcium mobilization, defective egress, and lack of invasion.

Bipartite split mFAPs enable real-time monitoring of protein-protein association and (unlike widely used split GFP reporter systems) are fully reversible, allowing direct readout of association and dissociation events.

Since the three-dimensional aromaticity and charge distributions of the carborane side chain are quite different from any side chains of proteinogenic amino acids, there is no report whether LCba can be a substrate for the translation machinery. Here, we report studies on the ribosomal incorporation of LCba into peptide via initiation and elongation using the flexizyme-assisted translation system. Our results indicate that only the initiation step could tolerate LCba incorporation, but the elongation steps could not, very likely due to its steric bulkiness of the side chain. Based on this knowledge, we have designed a library of macrocyclic peptides initiated by α-N-(2-choloroacetyl)-l-carboranylalanine (ClAc-LCba) and selected molecules capable of binding to human epidermal growth factor receptor (hEGFR). Two peptides that were forwarded to deeper studies exhibited affinities with KD values at 16 and 20 nM against hEGFR. Computational modeling of one of the peptides suggested that the carborane side chain might be directly involved in the interaction with the hydrophobic β-sheet core in the EGF binding site of hEGFR, which is consistent with the mutational data where replacing LCba residue with LPhe completely eliminated the binding activity. Cell lines that stably express hEGFR could be stained by incubation with the C-terminal fluorescein-labeled peptides, whereas hEGFR-negative cells could not be stained. This study provides a general strategy for the de novo discovery of carborane-containing macrocyclic peptides targeting various tumor biomarker proteins, potentially applicable to boron neutron capture therapy.",

After one round of site-directed saturation mutagenesis, improved variants of the two best designs, RA114 and RA117, exhibited among the highest kcat (>10(-3)s(-1)) and kcat/KM (11-25M(-1)s(-1)) values observed for retroaldolase designs prior to comprehensive directed evolution. In both cases, the >10(5)-fold rate accelerations that were achieved are within 1-3 orders of magnitude of the rate enhancements reported for the best catalysts for related reactions, including catalytic antibodies (kcat/kuncat=10(6) to 10(8)) and an extensively evolved computational design (kcat/kuncat>10(7)). The catalytic sites, revealed by X-ray structures of optimized versions of the two active designs, are in close agreement with the design models except for the catalytic lysine in RA114. We further improved the variants by computational remodeling of the loops and yeast display selection for reactivity of the catalytic lysine with a diketone probe, obtaining an additional order of magnitude enhancement in activity with both approaches.",

Each ectodomain, comprising a unique combination of three variable (Ig) domains, exhibits isoform-specific homophilic binding in vitro. Although we have proposed that the ability of Dscam1 isoforms to distinguish between one another is crucial for neural circuit assembly, via a process called self-avoidance, whether recognition specificity is essential in vivo has not been addressed. Here we tackle this issue by assessing the function of Dscam1 isoforms with altered binding specificities. We generated pairs of chimeric isoforms that bind to each other (heterophilic) but not to themselves (homophilic). These isoforms failed to support self-avoidance or did so poorly. By contrast, coexpression of complementary isoforms within the same neuron restored self-avoidance. These data establish that recognition between Dscam1 isoforms on neurites of the same cell provides the molecular basis for self-avoidance.",

        "abstract": "A key in understanding the neurobiology of addiction and developing effective pharmacotherapies is revealing drug-induced plasticity that results in heightened relapse susceptibility. Previous studies have demonstrated that increased extracellular glutamate, but not dopamine, in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) is necessary for cocaine-induced reinstatement. In this report, we examined whether drug-induced adaptations that are necessary to generate cocaine-induced reinstatement also determine relapse vulnerability. To do this, rats were assigned to self-administer cocaine under conditions resulting in low (2 h/d; 0.5 mg/kg/infusion, i.v.) or high (6 h/d; 1.0 mg/kg/infusion, i.v.) levels of drug intake since these manipulations produce groups of rats exhibiting differences in the magnitude of cocaine-induced reinstatement. Approximately 19 d after the last session, cocaine-induced drug seeking and extracellular levels of glutamate and dopamine in the NAcc were measured. Contrary to our hypothesis, high-intake rats exhibited a more robust cocaine-induced increase in extracellular levels of dopamine but not glutamate. Further, increased reinstatement in high-intake rats was no longer observed when the D(1) receptor antagonist SCH-23390 was infused into the NAcc. The sensitized dopamine response to cocaine in high-intake rats may involve blunted cystine-glutamate exchange by system x(c(-)). Reduced (14)C-cystine uptake through system x(c(-)) was evident in NAcc tissue slices obtained from high-intake rats, and the augmented dopamine response in these rats was no longer observed when subjects received the cysteine prodrug N-acetyl cysteine. These data reveal a role for drug-induced NAcc dopamine in heightened relapse vulnerability observed in rats with a history of high levels of drug intake.",

Cellular and molecular mechanisms enabling the parasite to sense and respond to the intra- and the extra-cellular environments are therefore key elements for the proliferation and transmission of Plasmodium, and therefore are, from a public health perspective, strategic targets in the fight against this deadly disease. The MALSIG consortium, which was initiated in February 2009, was designed with the primary objective to integrate research ongoing in Europe and India on i) the properties of Plasmodium signalling molecules, and ii) developmental processes occurring at various points of the parasite life cycle. On one hand, functional studies of individual genes and their products in Plasmodium falciparum (and in the technically more manageable rodent model Plasmodium berghei) are providing information on parasite protein kinases and phosphatases, and of the molecules governing cyclic nucleotide metabolism and calcium signalling. On the other hand, cellular and molecular studies are elucidating key steps of parasite development such as merozoite invasion and egress in blood and liver parasite stages, control of DNA replication in asexual and sexual development, membrane dynamics and trafficking, production of gametocytes in the vertebrate host and further parasite development in the mosquito. This article, which synthetically reviews such signalling molecules and cellular processes, aims to provide a glimpse of the global frame in which the activities of the MALSIG consortium will develop over the next three years.",

        "abstract": "The loss of control over cocaine use and persistently heightened susceptibility to drug relapse that define human cocaine addiction are consequences of drug-induced neuroplasticity and can be studied in rats self-administering cocaine under conditions of daily long access (LgA) as escalating patterns of drug intake and heightened susceptibility to reinstatement. This study investigated the potential contribution of elevated glucocorticoids at the time of LgA cocaine self-administration (SA) to these behavioral indices of addiction-related neuroplasticity. Rats provided 14 days of 6-h access (LgA) to cocaine showed a progressive escalation of SA and were more susceptible to cocaine-induced reinstatement (10 mg/kg, i.p.) compared to rats self-administering under short-access (ShA; 2 h) conditions. A surgical adrenalectomy and corticosterone replacement (ADX/C) regimen that eliminated SA-induced increases in corticosterone (CORT) while maintaining the diurnal pattern of secretion failed to alter SA or reinstatement in ShA rats but slowed escalation and attenuated later reinstatement in LgA rats when applied before but not after chronic LgA SA testing. Although the contribution of other adrenal hormones cannot be ruled out, these data suggest that elevated glucocorticoids at the time of cocaine exposure may be required for the effects of LgA SA on cocaine intake and later reinstatement. The inability of daily CORT administration before daily ShA SA, at a dose that reproduced the response during LgA SA, to mimic the effects of LgA SA suggests that elevated glucocorticoids during SA may play a permissive role in cocaine-induced neuroplasticity that contributes to addiction.",

To determine the precise residues that cause instability, we calculated the folding free energy (Delta G) of a collection of FRB mutants by measuring their intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence during reversible chaotropic denaturation. Our results implicate the T2098L point mutation as a key determinant of instability. Further, we found that some of the mutants in this collection were destabilized by up to 6 kcal mol(-1) relative to the wild type. To investigate how these mutants behave in cells, we expressed firefly luciferase fused to FRB mutants in African green monkey kidney (COS) cell lines and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). When unstable FRB mutants were used, we found that the protein levels and the luminescence intensities were low. However, addition of a chemical ligand for FRB, rapamycin, restored luciferase activity. Interestingly, we found a roughly linear relationship between the Delta G of the FRB mutants calculated in vitro and the relative chemical rescue in cells. Because rapamycin is capable of simultaneously binding both FRB and the chaperone, FK506-binding protein (FKBP), we next examined whether FKBP might contribute to the protection of FRB mutants. Using both in vitro experiments and a cell-based model, we found that FKBP stabilizes the mutants. These findings are consistent with recent models that suggest damage to intrinsic Delta G can be corrected by pharmacological chaperones. Further, these results provide a collection of conditionally stable fusion partners for use in controlling protein stability.",

(2007) Nature445, 447-451]. This APOBEC2 structure had considerable impact in the HIV field because it was considered a good model for the structure of APOBEC3G, an important HIV restriction factor that abrogates HIV infectivity in the absence of the viral accessory protein Vif. The quaternary structure and the arrangement of the monomers of APOBEC2 in the crystal were taken as being representative for APOBEC3G and exploited in explaining its enzymatic and anti-HIV activity. Here we show, unambiguously, that in contrast to the findings for the crystal, APOBEC2 is monomeric in solution. The nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of full-length APOBEC2 reveals that the N-terminal tail that was removed for crystallization resides close to strand β2, the dimer interface in the crystal structure, and shields this region of the protein from engaging in intermolecular contacts. In addition, the presence of the N-terminal region drastically alters the aggregation propensity of APOBEC2, rendering the full-length protein highly soluble and not prone to precipitation. In summary, our results cast doubt on all previous structure-function predictions for APOBEC3G that were based on the crystal structure of APOBEC2.",

It has been shown that a conformational change of the integrin beta-subunit headpiece (i.e. the beta I domain and the hybrid domain) plays a critical role in regulating integrin ligand binding affinity and function. Previous studies have used coarse methods (a glycan wedge, mutations in transmembrane contacts) to force the beta-subunit into either the open or closed conformation. Here, we demonstrate a detailed understanding of this conformational change by applying computational design techniques to select five amino acid side chains that play an important role in the energetic balance between the open and closed conformations of alphaIIbbeta3. Eight single-point mutants were designed at these sites, of which five bound ligands much better than wild type. Further, these mutants were found to be in a more extended conformation than wild type, suggesting that the conformational change at the ligand binding headpiece was propagated to the legs of the integrin. This detailed understanding of the conformational change will assist in the development of allosteric drugs that either stabilize or destabilize specific integrin conformations without occluding the ligand-binding site.",

        "abstract": "Evolutionary pressure on residue interactions, intramolecular or intermolecular, that are important for protein structure or function can lead to covariance between the two positions. Recent methodological advances allow much more accurate contact predictions to be derived from this evolutionary covariance signal. The practical application of contact predictions has largely been confined to structural bioinformatics, yet, as this work seeks to demonstrate, the data can be of enormous value to the structural biologist working in X-ray crystallo-graphy, cryo-EM or NMR. Integrative structural bioinformatics packages such as Rosetta can already exploit contact predictions in a variety of ways. The contribution of contact predictions begins at construct design, where structural domains may need to be expressed separately and contact predictions can help to predict domain limits. Structure solution by molecular replacement (MR) benefits from contact predictions in diverse ways: in difficult cases, more accurate search models can be constructed using ab initio modelling when predictions are available, while intermolecular contact predictions can allow the construction of larger, oligomeric search models. Furthermore, MR using supersecondary motifs or large-scale screens against the PDB can exploit information, such as the parallel or antiparallel nature of any β-strand pairing in the target, that can be inferred from contact predictions. Contact information will be particularly valuable in the determination of lower resolution structures by helping to assign sequence register. In large complexes, contact information may allow the identity of a protein responsible for a certain region of density to be determined and then assist in the orientation of an available model within that density. In NMR, predicted contacts can provide long-range information to extend the upper size limit of the technique in a manner analogous but complementary to experimental methods. Finally, predicted contacts can distinguish between biologically relevant interfaces and mere lattice contacts in a final crystal structure, and have potential in the identification of functionally important regions and in foreseeing the consequences of mutations.",

Previously, monomeric AFPs have been conjugated to the termini of branched polymers to increase their activity through the simultaneous binding of more than one AFP to ice. Here, we describe a superior approach to increasing AFP activity through oligomerization that eliminates the need for conjugation reactions with varying levels of efficiency. A moderately active AFP from a fish and a hyperactive AFP from an Antarctic bacterium were genetically fused to the C-termini of one component of the 24-subunit protein cage T33-21, resulting in protein nanoparticles that multivalently display exactly 12 AFPs. The resulting nanoparticles exhibited freezing point depression >50-fold greater than that seen with the same concentration of monomeric AFP and a similar increase in the level of ice-recrystallization inhibition. These results support the anchored clathrate mechanism of binding of AFP to ice. The enhanced freezing point depression could be due to the difficulty of overgrowing a larger AFP on the ice surface and the improved ice-recrystallization inhibition to the ability of the nanoparticle to simultaneously bind multiple ice grains. Oligomerization of these proteins using self-assembling protein cages will be useful in a variety of biotechnology and cryobiology applications.",

We found that stimulation of the VMN, achieved by local microinjections of AMPA, decreased standard chow consumption in food-restricted rats (e.g., homeostatic feeding); surprisingly, this manipulation failed to alter palatable food consumption in satiated rats (e.g., hedonic feeding). In contrast, inhibition of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), through local microinjections of GABA receptor agonists baclofen and muscimol, decreased hedonic feeding without altering homeostatic feeding. PACAP microinjections produced the site-specific changes in synaptic transmission needed to decrease feeding via VMN or NAc circuitry. PACAP into the NAc mimicked the actions of GABA agonists by reducing hedonic feeding without altering homeostatic feeding. In contrast, PACAP into the VMN mimicked the actions of AMPA by decreasing homeostatic feeding without affecting hedonic feeding. Slice electrophysiology recordings verified PACAP excitation of VMN neurons and inhibition of NAc neurons. These data suggest that the VMN and NAc regulate distinct circuits giving rise to unique feeding drives, but that both can be regulated by the neuropeptide PACAP to potentially curb excessive eating stemming from either drive.",

        "abstract": "Eukaryotic transmembrane helical (TMH) proteins perform a wide diversity of critical cellular functions, but remain structurally largely uncharacterized and their high-resolution structure prediction is currently hindered by the lack of close structural homologues. To address this problem, we present a novel and generic method for accurately modeling large TMH protein structures from distant homologues exhibiting distinct loop and TMH conformations. Models of the adenosine A2AR and chemokine CXCR4 receptors were first ranked in GPCR-DOCK blind prediction contests in the receptor structure accuracy category. In a benchmark of 50 TMH protein homolog pairs of diverse topology (from 5 to 12 TMHs), size (from 183 to 420 residues) and sequence identity (from 15% to 70%), the method improves most starting templates, and achieves near-atomic accuracy prediction of membrane-embedded regions. Unlike starting templates, the models are of suitable quality for computer-based protein engineering: redesigned models and redesigned X-ray structures exhibit very similar native interactions. The method should prove useful for the atom-level modeling and design of a large fraction of structurally uncharacterized TMH proteins from a wide range of structural homologues.",

A long-standing design approach uses genetic fusion to join protein homo-oligomer subunits via α-helical linkers to form more complex symmetric assemblies, but this method is hampered by linker flexibility and a dearth of geometric solutions. Here, we describe a general computational method for rigidly fusing homo-oligomer and spacer building blocks to generate user-defined architectures that generates far more geometric solutions than previous approaches. The fusion junctions are then optimized using Rosetta to minimize flexibility. We apply this method to design and test 92 dihedral symmetric protein assemblies using a set of designed homodimers and repeat protein building blocks. Experimental validation by native mass spectrometry, small-angle X-ray scattering, and negative-stain single-particle electron microscopy confirms the assembly states for 11 designs. Most of these assemblies are constructed from designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), held in place on one end by α-helical fusion and on the other by a designed homodimer interface, and we explored their use for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure determination by incorporating DARPin variants selected to bind targets of interest. Although the target resolution was limited by preferred orientation effects and small scaffold size, we found that the dual anchoring strategy reduced the flexibility of the target-DARPIN complex with respect to the overall assembly, suggesting that multipoint anchoring of binding domains could contribute to cryo-EM structure determination of small proteins.",

However, many protein cage designs that are tested in the lab do not form the desired assembly, and improving the success rate of design has been a point of recent emphasis. Here we present two protein structures solved by X-ray crystallography of designed protein oligomers that form two-component cages with tetrahedral symmetry. To improve on the past tendency toward poorly soluble protein, we used a computational protocol that favors the formation of hydrogen-bonding networks over exclusively hydrophobic interactions to stabilize the designed protein-protein interfaces. Preliminary characterization showed highly soluble expression, and solution studies indicated successful cage formation by both designed proteins. For one of the designs, a crystal structure confirmed at high resolution that the intended tetrahedral cage was formed, though several flipped amino acid side chain rotamers resulted in an interface that deviates from the precise hydrogen-bonding pattern that was intended. A structure of the other designed cage showed that, under the conditions where crystals were obtained, a noncage structure was formed wherein a porous 3D protein network in space group I21 3 is generated by an off-target twofold homomeric interface. These results illustrate some of the ongoing challenges of developing computational methods for polar interface design, and add two potentially valuable new entries to the growing list of engineered protein materials for downstream applications.",

A limitation of this approach is that the interactions between the side chains themselves are not constrained. An extensive connected hydrogen bond network involving the catalytic residues was observed in a designed retroaldolase following directed evolution. Such connected networks could increase catalytic activity by preorganizing active site residues in catalytically competent orientations, and enabling concerted interactions between side chains during catalysis, for example, proton shuffling. We developed a method for designing active sites in which the catalytic side chains, in addition to making interactions with the transition state, are also involved in extensive hydrogen bond networks. Because of the added constraint of hydrogen-bond connectivity between the catalytic side chains, to find solutions, a wider range of interactions between these side chains and the transition state must be considered. Our new method starts from a ChemDraw-like two-dimensional representation of the transition state with hydrogen-bond donors, acceptors, and covalent interaction sites indicated, and all placements of side-chain functional groups that make the indicated interactions with the transition state, and are fully connected in a single hydrogen-bond network are systematically enumerated. The RosettaMatch method can then be used to identify realizations of these fully-connected active sites in protein scaffolds. The method generates many fully-connected active site solutions for a set of model reactions that are promising starting points for the design of fully-preorganized enzyme catalysts.",

In malaria parasites, cooperative activation of PKG triggers crucial developmental transitions throughout the complex life cycle. We have determined the cGMP-free crystallographic structures of PKG from Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, revealing how key structural components, including an N-terminal autoinhibitory segment (AIS), four predicted cyclic nucleotide-binding domains (CNBs), and a kinase domain (KD), are arranged when the enzyme is inactive. The four CNBs and the KD are in a pentagonal configuration, with the AIS docked in the substrate site of the KD in a swapped-domain dimeric arrangement. We show that although the protein is predominantly a monomer (the dimer is unlikely to be representative of the physiological form), the binding of the AIS is necessary to keep Plasmodium PKG inactive. A major feature is a helix serving the dual role of the N-terminal helix of the KD as well as the capping helix of the neighboring CNB. A network of connecting helices between neighboring CNBs contributes to maintaining the kinase in its inactive conformation. We propose a scheme in which cooperative binding of cGMP, beginning at the CNB closest to the KD, transmits conformational changes around the pentagonal molecule in a structural relay mechanism, enabling PKG to orchestrate rapid, highly regulated developmental switches in response to dynamic modulation of cGMP levels in the parasite.",

To trigger cell differentiation, these barriers to transcriptional activation must be relieved, and it is established that posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and sumoylation, can specifically impair the repressive functions of Tel and Yan and are crucial for modulating their transcriptional activity. To date, however, relatively little is known about the control of Tel and Yan protein degradation. In recent years, there has been a concentrated effort to assign functions to the large number of F-box proteins encoded by both vertebrate and invertebrate genomes. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a previously unreported, evolutionarily conserved F-box protein named Fbl6. We isolated both human and Drosophila melanogaster fbl6 cDNA and show that the encoded Fbl6 protein binds to both Tel and Yan via their SAM domains. We demonstrate that both Tel and Yan are ubiquitinated, a process which is stimulated by Fbl6 and leads to proteasomal degradation. We recently established that the sumoylation of Tel on lysine 11 negatively regulates its repressive function and that the sumoylation of Tel monomers, but not that of Tel oligomers, may sensitize Tel for proteasomal degradation. Here, we found that Fbl6 regulates Tel/Yan protein stability and allows appropriate spatiotemporal control of gene expression by these repressors.",

This catalytic prowess has inspired efforts to design de novo helical bundle scaffolds that bind porphyrin cofactors. However, such designs lack the large open substrate binding pocket of P450s, and hence, the range of chemical transformations accessible is limited. Here, with the goal of combining the advantages of the P450 catalytic site geometry with the almost unlimited customizability of de novo protein design, we design a high-affinity heme-binding protein, dnHEM1, with an axial histidine ligand, a vacant coordination site for generating reactive intermediates, and a tunable distal pocket for substrate binding. A 1.6 Å X-ray crystal structure of dnHEM1 reveals excellent agreement to the design model with key features programmed as intended. The incorporation of distal pocket substitutions converted dnHEM1 into a proficient peroxidase with a stable neutral ferryl intermediate. In parallel, dnHEM1 was redesigned to generate enantiocomplementary carbene transferases for styrene cyclopropanation (up to 93% isolated yield, 5000 turnovers, 97:3 e.r.) by reconfiguring the distal pocket to accommodate calculated transition state models.

Phosphorylation of glycerol by GK is the rate-limiting step in glycerol utilization. Deletion of this gene from P. falciparum had no effect on asexual parasite growth, but surprisingly also had no effect on gametocyte development or exflagellation, suggesting that these life cycle stages do not utilize host-derived glycerol as a carbon source. Kinetic studies of purified PfGK showed that the enzyme is not regulated by fructose 1,6 bisphosphate. The high-resolution crystal structure of P. falciparum GK, the first of a eukaryotic GK, reveals two domains embracing a capacious ligand-binding groove. In the complexes of PfGK with glycerol and ADP, we observed closed and open forms of the active site respectively.

This paper looks at collective learning as a concept, its evolution within hominine species, its role in human demography, and the two great revolutions of human history: agriculture and industry. The paper then goes on to explain the connection of collective learning to Jared Diamond’s Tasmanian Effect. Collective learning also played a key role in the two Great Divergences of the past two thousand years.

We describe the creation of an extensive set of HE variants with novel DNA cleavage specificities using an integrated experimental and computational approach. Using computational modeling and an improved selection strategy, which optimizes specificity in addition to activity, we engineered an endonuclease to cleave in a gene associated with Anopheles sterility and another to cleave near a mutation that causes pyruvate kinase deficiency.

Unusual complementarity-determining region (CDR) structural features revealed by our analyses identify a previously unrecognized mechanism by which the highly variable CDR3 regions define ligand specificity. In addition to the pMHC contact residues contributed by CDR3, the CDR3 residues buried deep within the V alpha/V beta interface exert indirect effects on recognition by influencing the V alpha/V beta interdomain angle. This phenomenon represents an additional mechanism for increasing the potential diversity of the TCR repertoire. Both the direct and indirect effects exerted by CDR residues can impact global TCR/MHC docking. Analysis of the available TCR structures in light of these results highlights the significance of the V alpha/V beta interdomain angle in determining specificity and indicates that TCR/pMHC interface features do not distinguish autoimmune from non-autoimmune class II-restricted TCRs.",

Implementing these methods is often accomplished by researchers with domain expertise but without formal training in software engineering or computer science. This arrangement has led to underappreciation of sustainability and maintainability of scientific software tools developed in academic environments. Some software tools have avoided this fate, including the scientific library Rosetta. We use this software and its community as a case study to show how modern software development can be accomplished successfully, irrespective of subject area. Rosetta is one of the largest software suites for macromolecular modeling, with 3.1 million lines of code and many state-of-the-art applications. Since the mid 1990s, the software has been developed collaboratively by the RosettaCommons, a community of academics from over 60 institutions worldwide with diverse backgrounds including chemistry, biology, physiology, physics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. Developing this software suite has provided us with more than two decades of experience in how to effectively develop advanced scientific software in a global community with hundreds of contributors. Here we illustrate the functioning of this development community by addressing technical aspects (like version control, testing, and maintenance), community-building strategies, diversity efforts, software dissemination, and user support. We demonstrate how modern computational research can thrive in a distributed collaborative community.

Previous guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl; an ionic denaturant) experiments of a designed, naturally occurring βα fold, Di-III_14, revealed a cooperative, two-state unfolding transition and a modest stability. Continuous-flow mixing experiments in our laboratory revealed a simple two-state reaction in the microsecond to millisecond time range and consistent with the thermodynamic results. In striking contrast, the protein remains folded up to 9.25 M in urea, a neutral denaturant, and hydrogen exchange (HDX) NMR analysis in water revealed the presence of numerous high-energy states that interconvert on a time scale greater than seconds. The complex protection pattern for HDX corresponds closely with a pair of electrostatic networks on the surface and an extensive network of hydrophobic side chains in the interior of the protein. Mutational analysis showed that electrostatic and hydrophobic networks contribute to the resistance to urea denaturation for the WT protein; remarkably, single charge reversals on the protein surface restore the expected urea sensitivity. The roughness of the energy surface reflects the densely packed hydrophobic core; the removal of only two methyl groups eliminates the high-energy states and creates a smooth surface. The design of a very stable βα fold containing electrostatic and hydrophobic networks has created a complex energy surface rarely observed in natural proteins.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the neurobiological processes that contribute to the establishment and expression of stress-induced regulation of cocaine use in addicted individuals is important for the development of new and better treatment approaches. It has been previously shown that rats self-administering cocaine under long-access conditions (6 h daily) display heightened susceptibility to the reinstatement of extinguished cocaine seeking by a stressor, electric footshock, or i.c.v. administration of the stressor-responsive neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). This study tested the hypothesis that adrenal responsiveness during earlier long-access cocaine self-administration (SA) is necessary for the establishment of later CRF-dependent stress-induced reinstatement. Reinstatement by footshock, but not a cocaine challenge (10 mg/kg, i.p.) following long-access SA, was blocked by i.c.v. administration of the CRF receptor antagonist, α-helical CRF(9-41) (10 μg). Elimination of SA-induced adrenal responses through surgical adrenalectomy and diurnal corticosterone replacement (ADX/C) before 14 days of SA under long-access conditions had minimal impact on cocaine SA, but blocked later footshock-induced reinstatement. By contrast, ADX/C after SA, but before extinction and reinstatement testing, failed to reduce footshock-induced reinstatement. Likewise, ADX/C before 14 days long-access SA prevented later reinstatement by i.c.v. CRF (0.5 or 1.0 μg). However, significant CRF-induced reinstatement was observed when rats underwent ADX/C following SA, but before extinction and reinstatement testing, although a modest but statistically nonsignificant reduction in sensitivity to CRF's reinstating effects was observed. Taken together, these findings suggest that adrenal-dependent neuroadaptations in CRF responsiveness underlie the increased susceptibility to stress-induced relapse that emerges with repeated cocaine use.",

We redesigned the disordered region of MICA with RosettaDesign to increase NKG2D binding. Mutations that stabilize this region were expected to increase association kinetics without changing dissociation kinetics, increase affinity of interaction, and reduce entropy loss upon binding. MICA mutants were stable in solution, and they were amenable to surface plasmon resonance evaluation of NKG2D binding kinetics and thermodynamics. Several MICA mutants bound NKG2D with enhanced affinity, kinetic changes were primarily observed during association, and thermodynamic changes in entropy were as expected. However, none of the 15 combinations of mutations predicted to stabilize the receptor-bound MICA conformation enhanced NKG2D affinity, whereas all 10 mutants predicted to be destabilized bound NKG2D with increased on-rates. Five of these had affinities enhanced by 0.9-1.8 kcal/mol over wild type by one to three non-contacting substitutions.

        "abstract": "We recently used computational protein design to create an extremely stable, globular protein, Top7, with a sequence and fold not observed previously in nature. Since Top7 was created in the absence of genetic selection, it provides a rare opportunity to investigate aspects of the cellular protein production and surveillance machinery that are subject to natural selection. Here we show that a portion of the Top7 protein corresponding to the final 49 C-terminal residues is efficiently mis-translated and accumulates at high levels in Escherichia coli. We used circular dichroism, size-exclusion chromatography, small-angle X-ray scattering, analytical ultra-centrifugation, and NMR spectroscopy to show that the resulting C-terminal fragment (CFr) protein adopts a compact, extremely stable, homo-dimeric structure. Based on the solution structure, we engineered an even more stable variant of CFr by disulfide-induced covalent circularisation that should be an excellent platform for design of novel functions. The accumulation of high levels of CFr exposes the high error rate of the protein translation machinery. The rarity of correspondingly stable fragments in natural proteins coupled with the observation that high quality ribosome binding sites are found to occur within E. coli protein-coding regions significantly less often than expected by random chance implies a stringent evolutionary pressure against protein sub-fragments that can independently fold into stable structures. The symmetric self-association between two identical mis-translated CFr sub-domains to generate an extremely stable structure parallels a mechanism for natural protein-fold evolution by modular recombination of protein sub-structures.",

To overcome this limitation, we develop ProteinGenerator, a sequence space diffusion model based on RoseTTAfold that simultaneously generates protein sequences and structures. Beginning from random amino acid sequences, our model generates sequence and structure pairs by iterative denoising, guided by any desired sequence and structural protein attributes. To explore the versatility of this approach, we designed proteins enriched for specific amino acids, with internal sequence repeats, with masked bioactive peptides, with state dependent structures, and with key sequence features of specific protein families. ProteinGenerator readily generates sequence-structure pairs satisfying the input conditioning (sequence and/or structural) criteria, and experimental validation showed that the designs were monomeric by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), had the desired secondary structure content by circular dichroism (CD), and were thermostable up to 95°C. By enabling the simultaneous optimization of both sequence and structure, ProteinGenerator allows for the design of functional proteins with specific sequence and structural attributes, and paves the way for protein function optimization by active learning on sequence-activity datasets.",

        "abstract": "Stressful and aversive events promote maladaptive reward-seeking behaviors such as drug addiction by acting, in part, on the mesolimbic dopamine system. Using animal models, data from our laboratory and others show that stress and cocaine can interact to produce a synergistic effect on reward circuitry. This effect is also observed when the stress hormone corticosterone is administered directly into the nucleus accumbens (NAc), indicating that glucocorticoids act locally in dopamine terminal regions to enhance cocaine's effects on dopamine signaling. However, prior studies in behaving animals have not provided mechanistic insight. Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, we examined the effect of systemic corticosterone on spontaneous dopamine release events (transients) in the NAc core and shell in behaving rats. A physiologically relevant systemic injection of corticosterone (2 mg/kg i.p.) induced an increase in dopamine transient amplitude and duration (both voltammetric measures sensitive to decreases in dopamine clearance), but had no effect on the frequency of transient release events. This effect was compounded by cocaine (2.5 mg/kg i.p.). However, a second experiment indicated that the same injection of corticosterone had no detectable effect on the dopaminergic encoding of a palatable natural reward (saccharin). Taken together, these results suggest that corticosterone interferes with naturally occurring dopamine uptake locally, and this effect is a critical determinant of dopamine concentration specifically in situations in which the dopamine transporter is pharmacologically blocked by cocaine.",

The manual sequence changes involve both reversions of amino acid mutations back to the identity present in the parent scaffold and the introduction of residues making additional interactions with the binding partner or backing up first shell interactions. Automation of this manual sequence refinement process would allow more systematic evaluation and considerably reduce the amount of human designer effort involved. Here we introduce a benchmark for evaluating the ability of automated methods to recapitulate the sequence changes made to computer-generated models by human designers, and use it to assess alternative computational methods. We find the best performance for a greedy one-position-at-a-time optimization protocol that utilizes metrics (such as shape complementarity) and local refinement methods too computationally expensive for global Monte Carlo (MC) sequence optimization. This protocol should be broadly useful for improving the stability and function of designed binding proteins.",

        "abstract": "Protein structure prediction methods such as Rosetta search for the lowest energy conformation of the polypeptide chain. However, the experimentally observed native state is at a minimum of the free energy, rather than the energy. The neglect of the missing configurational entropy contribution to the free energy can be partially justified by the assumption that the entropies of alternative folded states, while very much less than unfolded states, are not too different from one another, and hence can be to a first approximation neglected when searching for the lowest free energy state. The shortcomings of current structure prediction methods may be due in part to the breakdown of this assumption. Particularly problematic are proteins with significant disordered regions which do not populate single low energy conformations even in the native state. We describe two approaches within the Rosetta structure modeling methodology for treating such regions. The first does not require advance knowledge of the regions likely to be disordered; instead these are identified by minimizing a simple free energy function used previously to model protein folding landscapes and transition states. In this model, residues can be either completely ordered or completely disordered; they are considered disordered if the gain in entropy outweighs the loss of favorable energetic interactions with the rest of the protein chain. The second approach requires identification in advance of the disordered regions either from sequence alone using for example the DISOPRED server or from experimental data such as NMR chemical shifts. During Rosetta structure prediction calculations the disordered regions make only unfavorable repulsive contributions to the total energy. We find that the second approach has greater practical utility and illustrate this with examples from de novo structure prediction, NMR structure calculation, and comparative modeling.",

To meet this challenge, here we combine the dimerisable Cre (DiCre) system with the use of multiple lox sites to simultaneously generate multiple recombination events of the same gene. We focused on the Plasmodium falciparum cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), creating in parallel conditional disruption of the gene plus up to two allelic replacements. We use the approach to demonstrate that PKG has no scaffolding or adaptor role in intraerythrocytic development, acting solely at merozoite egress.

Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) has been used to make several immunotoxins that have been evaluated in clinical trials. Immunogenicity of the bacterial toxin and off-target toxicity have limited the efficacy of these immunotoxins. To address these issues, we have previously made RITs in which the Fv is connected to domain III (PE24) by a furin cleavage site (FCS), thereby removing unneeded sequences of domain II. However, the PE24 containing RITs do not contain the naturally occurring disulfide bond around the furin cleavage sequence, because it was removed when domain II was deleted. This could potentially allow PE24 containing immunotoxins to be cleaved and inactivated before internalization by cell surface furin or other proteases in the blood stream or tumor microenvironment. Here, we describe five new RITs in which a disulfide bond is engineered to protect the FCS. The most active of these, SS1-Fab-DS3-PE24, shows a longer serum half-life than an RIT without the disulfide bond and has the same anti-tumor activity, despite being less cytotoxic in vitro.

Its pepsin-like aspartic protease (retropepsin) is an integral part of the expressed retroviral polyproteins. As in all retroviral life cycles, release and dimerization of the protease (PR) is strictly required for polyprotein processing and virion maturation. Biophysical and NMR studies have indicated that in the absence of substrates or inhibitors M-PMV PR should fold into a stable monomer, but the crystal structure of this protein could not be solved by molecular replacement despite countless attempts. Ultimately, a solution was obtained in mr-rosetta using a model constructed by players of the online protein-folding game Foldit. The structure indeed shows a monomeric protein, with the N- and C-termini completely disordered. On the other hand, the flap loop, which normally gates access to the active site of homodimeric retropepsins, is clearly traceable in the electron density. The flap has an unusual curled shape and a different orientation from both the open and closed states known from dimeric retropepsins. The overall fold of the protein follows the retropepsin canon, but the C(α) deviations are large and the active-site 'DTG' loop (here NTG) deviates up to 2.7 Å from the standard conformation. This structure of a monomeric retropepsin determined at high resolution (1.6 Å) provides important extra information for the design of dimerization inhibitors that might be developed as drugs for the treatment of retroviral infections, including AIDS.",

        "abstract": "vaccines that confer broad and durable protection against diverse virus strains would have a major impact on global health. However, next-generation vaccine design efforts have been complicated by challenges including the genetic plasticity of the virus and the immunodominance of certain epitopes in its glycoprotein antigens. Here we show that computationally designed, two-component nanoparticle immunogens induce potently neutralizing and broadly protective antibody responses against a wide variety of influenza viruses. The nanoparticle immunogens display 20 hemagglutinin (HA) trimers in a highly immunogenic array, and their assembly in vitro enables precisely controlled co-display of multiple distinct HAs in defined ratios. Nanoparticle immunogens displaying the four HAs of licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIV) elicited hemagglutination inhibition and neutralizing antibody responses to vaccine-matched strains that were equivalent or superior to commercial QIV in mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primates. The nanoparticle immunogens—but not QIV—simultaneously induced broadly protective antibody responses to heterologous viruses, including H5N1 and H7N9, by targeting the subdominant yet conserved HA stem. Unlike previously reported influenza vaccine candidates, our nanoparticle immunogens can alter the intrinsic immunodominance hierarchy of HA to induce both potent receptor-blocking and broadly cross-reactive stem-directed antibody responses and are attractive candidates for a next-generation influenza vaccine that could replace current seasonal vaccines. One Sentence Summary Nanoparticle immunogens displaying four seasonal influenza hemagglutinins elicit neutralizing antibodies directed at both the immunodominant head and the conserved stem and confer broad protective immunity.",

The biosensors, comprising one ligand-binding domain monomer fused to a DNA-binding domain and another fused to a transcriptional activation domain, activate reporter gene expression in response to steroid binding and receptor dimerization. The introduction of a destabilizing mutation to the dimer interface increased biosensor dynamic range by an order of magnitude. Computational redesign of the dimer interface and functional selections were used to create heterodimeric pairs with further improved dynamic range. A heterodimeric biosensor built from the digoxigenin and progesterone ligand-binding domains functioned as a synthetic \"AND\"-gate, with 20-fold stronger response to the two ligands in combination than to either one alone. We also identified mutations that increase the sensitivity or selectivity of the biosensors to chemically similar ligands.

Structures combining tandem DHRs demonstrate a wide range of molecular geometries, many of which are not observed in nature. Understanding cooperativity of DHR proteins provides insight into the molecular origins of Rosetta-based protein design hyperstability and facilitates comparison of energy distributions in artificial and naturally occurring protein folds. Here, we use a nearest-neighbor Ising model to quantify the intrinsic and interfacial free energies of four different DHRs. We measure the folding free energies of constructs with varying numbers of internal and terminal capping repeats for four different DHR folds, using guanidine-HCl and glycerol as destabilizing and solubilizing cosolvents. One-dimensional Ising analysis of these series reveals that, although interrepeat coupling energies are within the range seen for naturally occurring repeat proteins, the individual repeats of DHR proteins are intrinsically stable. This favorable intrinsic stability, which has not been observed for naturally occurring repeat proteins, adds to stabilizing interfaces, resulting in extraordinarily high stability. Stable repeats also impart a downhill shape to the energy landscape for DHR folding. These intrinsic stability differences suggest that part of the success of Rosetta-based design results from capturing favorable local interactions.",

Activation of the immune system, in particular T-cells, is emerging as a possible mechanism underlying DN disease progression in humans and animal models. We hypothesized that inhibition of T-cell activation will ameliorate DN. Interaction of B7-1 (CD80) on the surface of antigen presenting cells with its binding partners, CTLA4 (CD152) and CD28 on T-cells, is essential for T-cell activation. In this study we used the soluble CTLA4-Fc fusion protein Abatacept to block cell surface B7-1, preventing the cellular interaction and inhibiting T-cell activation. When Abatacept was dosed in an animal model of diabetes-induced albuminuria, it reduced albuminuria in both prevention and intervention modes. The number of T-cells infiltrating the kidneys of DN animals correlated with the degree of albuminuria, and treatment with Abatacept reduced the number of renal T-cells. As B7-1 induction has been recently proposed to underlie podocyte damage in DN, Abatacept could be efficacious in DN by protecting podocytes. However, this does not appear to be the case as B7-1 was not expressed in 1) kidneys of DN animals; 2) stimulated human podocytes in culture; or 3) glomeruli of DN patients. We conclude that Abatacept ameliorates DN by blocking systemic T-cell activation and not by interacting with podocytes.",

To verify these sites biochemically and to probe their relative contributions to the protein L-Ig kappa light chain (kappa) interaction, we compared the binding of PLW (the Y47W mutant of the B1 domain) to that of mutants designed to disrupt binding to sites 1 and 2, using gel filtration, BIAcore surface plasmon resonance, fluorescence titration, and solid-phase radioimmunoassays. Gel filtration experiments show that PLW binds kappa both in 1:1 complexes and multivalently, consistent with two binding sites. Covalent dimers of the A20C and V51C mutants of PLW were prepared to eliminate site 1 and site 2 binding, respectively; both the A20C and V51C dimers bind kappa in 1:1 complexes and multivalently, indicating that neither site 1 nor site 2 is solely responsible for kappa binding. The A20R mutant was designed computationally to eliminate site 1 binding while preserving site 2 binding; consistent with this design, the A20R mutant binds kappa in 1:1 complexes but not multivalently. To probe the contributions of amino acid side chains to binding, we prepared 75 point mutants spanning nearly every residue of PLW; BIAcore studies of these mutants revealed two binding-energy \"hot spots\" consistent with sites 1 and 2. These data indicate that PLW binds kappa at both sites with similar affinities (high nanomolar), with the strongest contributions to the binding energy from Tyr34 (site 2) and Tyr36 (site 1). Compared to other protein-protein complexes, the binding is insensitive to amino acid substitutions at these sites, consistent with the large number of main chain interactions relative to side chain interactions. The strong binding of protein L to Ig kappa light chains of various species may result from the ambidextrous binding of the B1-B5 domains and the unimportance of specific side chain interactions.",

The planet orbits a fast-rotating F0 host star (T eff ≃ 7300 K) in 1.9 days and experiences intense irradiation. Notably, the TESS data show a clear secondary eclipse with a depth of 364 ± 28 ppm and a significant phase-curve signal, from which we obtain a relative day–night planetary flux difference of roughly 320 ppm and a 5.2σ detection of ellipsoidal distortion on the host star.

This approach trains a Potts model on a Multiple Sequence Alignment, then predicts that the edges with highest weight correspond to contacts in the 3D structure. On the other hand, increasingly large Transformers are being pretrained on protein sequence databases but have demonstrated mixed results for downstream tasks, including contact prediction. This has sparked discussion about the role of scale and attention-based models in unsupervised protein representation learning. We argue that attention is a principled model of protein interactions, grounded in real properties of protein family data. We introduce a simplified attention layer, factored attention, and show that it achieves comparable performance to Potts models, while sharing parameters both within and across families. Further, we extract contacts from the attention maps of a pretrained Transformer and show they perform competitively with the other two approaches. This provides evidence that large-scale pretraining can learn meaningful protein features when presented with unlabeled and unaligned data. We contrast factored attention with the Transformer to indicate that the Transformer leverages hierarchical signal in protein family databases not captured by our single-layer models. This raises the exciting possibility for the development of powerful structured models of protein family databases.1",

Fusion proteins are constructed by the linking of two protein domains with a peptide linker. The selection of a linker sequence is important for the construction of stable and bioactive fusion proteins. Empirically designed linkers are generally classified into two categories according to their structural features: flexible linkers and rigid linkers. Rigid linkers with the α-helix-forming sequences A(EAAAK)nA (n=2-5) were first designed about two decades ago to control the distance between two protein domains and to reduce their interference. Thereafter, the helical linkers have been applied to the construction of many fusion proteins to improve expression and bioactivity. In addition, the design of fusion proteins that self-assemble into supramolecular complexes is useful for nanobiotechnology and synthetic biology. A protein that forms a self-assembling oligomer was fused by a rigid helical linker to another protein that forms another self-assembling oligomer, and the fusion protein symmetrically self-assembled into a designed protein nanoparticle or nanomaterial. Moreover, to construct chain-like polymeric nanostructures, extender protein nanobuilding blocks were designed by tandemly fusing two dimeric de novo proteins with helical or flexible linkers. The linker design of fusion proteins can affect conformation and dynamics of self-assembling nanostructures. The present review and methods focus on useful helical linkers to construct bioactive fusion proteins and protein-based nanostructures.",

The ranking proceeds in two steps: first, an optimal assignment of the NMR peaks to atoms is found for each model independently, and second, the models are ranked based on the consistency between the NMR data and the model assuming these optimal assignments. The low-resolution model selected using this ranking procedure had the correct overall fold and a global backbone RMSD of 6.0 angstrom, and was subsequently refined to 3.7 angstrom RMSD. With the incorporation of a small number of NOE and residual dipolar coupling constraints available very early in the traditional spectral assignment process, a model with an RMSD of 2.8 angstrom could rapidly be built.

The basic premise is that insertion of a long disordered sequence into a loop of a host protein will substantially destabilize the host because of the entropic cost of closing a loop in a disordered chain. If the inserted sequence spontaneously folds into a stable structure with the N and C termini close in space, however, this entropic cost is diminished. The host protein function can, therefore, be used to select folded inserted sequences without relying on specific properties of the inserted sequence. This principle is tested using the IgG binding domain of protein L and the lck SH2 domain as host proteins. The results indicate that the loop entropy reduction screen is capable of discriminating folded from unfolded sequences when the proper host protein and insertion point are chosen.",

        "abstract": "Engineered proteins generally must possess a stable structure in order to achieve their designed function. Stable designs, however, are astronomically rare within the space of all possible amino acid sequences. As a consequence, many designs must be tested computationally and experimentally in order to find stable ones, which is expensive in terms of time and resources. Here we use a high-throughput, low-fidelity assay to experimentally evaluate the stability of approximately 200,000 novel proteins. These include a wide range of sequence perturbations, providing a baseline for future work in the field. We build a neural network model that predicts protein stability given only sequences of amino acids, and compare its performance to the assayed values. We also report another network model that is able to generate the amino acid sequences of novel stable proteins given requested secondary sequences. Finally, we show that the predictive model-despite weaknesses including a noisy data set-can be used to substantially increase the stability of both expert-designed and model-generated proteins.",

Prognosis of some ALCL subgroups is still unsatisfactory, and already in second line effective treatment options are lacking. To identify genes defining ALCL cell state and dependencies, we here characterize super-enhancer regions by genome-wide H3K27ac ChIP-seq. In addition to known ALCL key regulators, the AP-1-member BATF3 and IL-2 receptor (IL2R)-components are among the top hits. Specific and high-level IL2R expression in ALCL correlates with BATF3 expression. Confirming a regulatory link, IL-2R-expression decreases following BATF3 knockout, and BATF3 is recruited to IL2R regulatory regions. Functionally, IL-2, IL-15 and Neo-2/15, a hyper-stable IL-2/IL-15 mimic, accelerate ALCL growth and activate STAT1, STAT5 and ERK1/2. In line, strong IL-2Rα-expression in ALCL patients is linked to more aggressive clinical presentation. Finally, an IL-2Rα-targeting antibody-drug conjugate efficiently kills ALCL cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results highlight the importance of the BATF3/IL-2R-module for ALCL biology and identify IL-2Rα-targeting as a promising treatment strategy for ALCL.",

We use the approach to design binders to the human transferrin receptor which shuttles back and forth across the blood–brain barrier. Such binders could be useful for the delivery of therapeutics into the brain. The de novo design of polar protein–protein interactions is challenging because of the thermodynamic cost of stripping water away from the polar groups. Here, we describe a general approach for designing proteins which complement exposed polar backbone groups at the edge of beta sheets with geometrically matched beta strands. We used this approach to computationally design small proteins that bind to an exposed beta sheet on the human transferrin receptor (hTfR), which shuttles interacting proteins across the blood–brain barrier (BBB), opening up avenues for drug delivery into the brain. We describe a design which binds hTfR with a 20 nM Kd, is hyperstable, and crosses an in vitro microfluidic organ-on-a-chip model of the human BBB.

To elucidate the cellular role of AP-2μ in P. falciparum, we performed a conditional gene knockout, which severely disrupted schizont organization and maturation, leading to mislocalization of key merozoite proteins. AP-2μ is thus essential for blood-stage replication. We generated transgenic P. falciparum parasites expressing hemagglutinin-tagged AP-2μ and examined cellular localization by fluorescence and electron microscopy. Together with mass spectrometry analysis of coimmunoprecipitating proteins, these studies identified AP-2μ-interacting partners, including other AP-2 subunits, the K10 kelch-domain protein, and PfEHD, an effector of endocytosis and lipid mobilization, but no evidence was found of interaction with clathrin, the expected coat protein for AP-2 vesicles. In reverse immunoprecipitation experiments with a clathrin nanobody, other heterotetrameric AP-complexes were shown to interact with clathrin, but AP-2 complex subunits were absent.IMPORTANCE We examine in detail the AP-2 adaptin complex from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum In most studied organisms, AP-2 is involved in bringing material into the cell from outside, a process called endocytosis. Previous work shows that changes to the μ subunit of AP-2 can contribute to drug resistance. Our experiments show that AP-2 is essential for parasite development in blood but does not have any role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This suggests that a specialized function for AP-2 has developed in malaria parasites, and this may be important for understanding its impact on drug resistance.",

We identify a sample of 67 systems of transiting exoplanet candidates (with well-determined, edge-on orbital inclinations) that reside in wide visual binary systems. We derive limits on orbital parameters for the wide-binary systems and measure the minimum difference in orbital inclination between the binary and planet orbits. We determine that there is statistically significant difference in the inclination distribution of wide-binary systems with transiting planets compared to a control sample, with the probability that the two distributions are the same being 0.0037. This implies that there is an overabundance of planets in binary systems whose orbits are aligned with those of the binary. The overabundance of aligned systems appears to primarily have semimajor axes less than 700 au. We investigate some effects that could cause the alignment and conclude that a torque caused by a misaligned binary companion on the protoplanetary disk is the most promising explanation.",

The time dependence of ensemble averages allows insight into the time dynamics of the system and, in particular, illustrates the presence of the potential ordering transition. Finally, analysis of the latent variables along the single-particle trajectory allows tracing these parameters on a single-particle level.

To date, the underlying relationships governing both SBP-surface and SBP-SBP interactions and how they give rise to different adsorption mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we combine protein engineering, surface plasmon resonance characterization, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations initiated from Rosetta predictions to gain insights on the interplay of amino acid composition, structure, self-association, and adhesion modality in a panel of variants of the Car9 silica-binding peptide (DSARGFKKPGKR) fused to the C-terminus of superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP). Analysis of kinetics, energetics, and MD-predicted structures shows that the high-affinity binding of Car9 to the silanol-rich surface of silica is dominated by electrostatic contributions and a spectrum of several persistent interactions that, along with a high surface population of bound molecules, promote cooperative interactions between neighboring SBPs and higher order structure formation. Transition from cooperative to Langmuir adhesion in sfGFP-Car9 variants occurs in concert with a reduction of stable surface interactions and self-association, as confirmed by atomic force microscopy imaging of proteins exhibiting the two different binding behaviors. We discuss the implications of these results for the de novo design of SBP-surface binding systems.",

As a result, conventional approaches fail to produce field-ready vaccines before the EID has spread extensively. Lassa is a prototypical emerging infectious disease endemic to West Africa for which no successful vaccine is available. We established the VaxCelerate Consortium to address the need for more rapid vaccine development by creating a platform capable of generating and pre-clinically testing a new vaccine against specific pathogen targets in less than 120 d A self-assembling vaccine is at the core of the approach. It consists of a fusion protein composed of the immunostimulatory Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat shock protein 70 (MtbHSP70) and the biotin binding protein, avidin. Mixing the resulting protein (MAV) with biotinylated pathogen-specific immunogenic peptides yields a self-assembled vaccine (SAV). To meet the time constraint imposed on this project, we used a distributed R&D model involving experts in the fields of protein engineering and production, bioinformatics, peptide synthesis/design and GMP/GLP manufacturing and testing standards. SAV immunogenicity was first tested using H1N1 influenza specific peptides and the entire VaxCelerate process was then tested in a mock live-fire exercise targeting Lassa fever virus. We demonstrated that the Lassa fever vaccine induced significantly increased class II peptide specific interferon-γ CD4(+) T cell responses in HLA-DR3 transgenic mice compared to peptide or MAV alone controls. We thereby demonstrated that our SAV in combination with a distributed development model may facilitate accelerated regulatory review by using an identical design for each vaccine and by applying safety and efficacy assessment tools that are more relevant to human vaccine responses than current animal models.",

The X‐ray structure of the evolved catalyst covalently modified with a 1,3‐diketone inhibitor deviates substantially from the design model, however, with the ligand adopting a completely different orientation than predicted. Moreover, significant activity was maintained even after relocation of the reactive lysine within the apolar binding pocket. These results suggest that the success of the original design is not ascribable to atomically accurate molecular recognition, but rather to successful placement of a reactive lysine adjacent to an apolar binding pocket. Nevertheless, the stabilizing interactions observed at the active site of the evolved variant suggest that improvements in the precision of design calculations will afford enzymes with higher catalytic activities.",

For this reason, buried \"unsatisfied\" polar groups making no hydrogen bonds are very rare in proteins. Efficiently representing the energetic cost of unsatisfied hydrogen bonds with a pairwise-decomposable energy term during protein design is challenging since whether or not a group is satisfied depends on all of its neighbors. Here we describe a method for assigning a pairwise-decomposable energy to sidechain rotamers such that following combinatorial sidechain packing, buried unsaturated polar atoms are penalized. The penalty can be any quadratic function of the number of unsatisfied polar groups, and can be computed very rapidly. We show that inclusion of this term in Rosetta sidechain packing calculations substantially reduces the number of buried unsatisfied polar groups.",

Here, we study the dynamics of explicitly solvated designed proteins through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to gain insight into the causes that lead to the low affinity or instability of most of these designs, despite the prediction of their success by the computational design methodology. Simulations ranging from 500 to 1000 ns per replicate were conducted on 37 designed protein variants encompassing two distinct folds and a range of ligand affinities, resulting in more than 180 μs of combined sampling. The simulations provide retrospective insights into the properties affecting ligand affinity that can prove useful in guiding further steps of design optimization. Features indicate that entropic components are particularly important for affinity, which are not easily incorporated in the empirical models often used in design protocols. Additionally, we demonstrate that the application of machine learning approaches built upon the output from the simulations can help discriminate between successful and failed binders, such that MD could act as a screening step in protein design, resulting in a more efficient process.",

We previously reported that stress, via elevated corticosterone, potentiates cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine seeking following self-administration in rats and that this potentiation appears to involve corticosterone-induced blockade of dopamine clearance via the organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3). In the present study, we use a conditioned place preference/reinstatement paradigm in mice to directly test the hypothesis that corticosterone potentiates cocaine-primed reinstatement by blockade of OCT3. Consistent with our findings following self-administration in rats, pretreatment of male C57/BL6 mice with corticosterone (using a dose that reproduced stress-level plasma concentrations) potentiated cocaine-primed reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-induced conditioned place preference. Corticosterone failed to re-establish extinguished preference alone but produced a leftward shift in the dose-response curve for cocaine-primed reinstatement. A similar potentiating effect was observed upon pretreatment of mice with the non-glucocorticoid OCT3 blocker, normetanephrine. To determine the role of OCT3 blockade in these effects, we examined the abilities of corticosterone and normetanephrine to potentiate cocaine-primed reinstatement in OCT3-deficient and wild-type mice. Conditioned place preference, extinction and reinstatement of extinguished preference in response to low-dose cocaine administration did not differ between genotypes. However, corticosterone and normetanephrine failed to potentiate cocaine-primed reinstatement in OCT3-deficient mice. Together, these data provide the first direct evidence that the interaction of corticosterone with OCT3 mediates corticosterone effects on drug-seeking behavior and establish OCT3 function as an important determinant of susceptibility to cocaine use.",

        "abstract": "Sequence-based neural networks can learn to make accurate predictions from large biological datasets, but model interpretation remains challenging. Many existing feature attribution methods are optimized for continuous rather than discrete input patterns and assess individual feature importance in isolation, making them ill-suited for interpreting non-linear interactions in molecular sequences. Building on work in computer vision and natural language processing, we developed an approach based on deep learning - Scrambler networks - wherein the most salient sequence positions are identified with learned input masks. Scramblers learn to predict Position-Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs) where unimportant nucleotides or residues are scrambled by raising their entropy. We apply Scramblers to interpret the effects of genetic variants, uncover non-linear interactions between cis-regulatory elements, explain binding specificity for protein-protein interactions, and identify structural determinants of de novo designed proteins. We show that Scramblers enable efficient attribution across large datasets and result in high-quality explanations, often outperforming state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "During the course of the asexual erythrocytic stage of development, Plasmodium spp. parasites undergo a series of morphological changes and induce alterations in the host cell. At the end of this stage, the parasites egress from the infected cell, after which the progeny invade a new host cell. These processes are rapid and occur in a time-dependent manner. Of particular importance, egress and invasion of erythrocytes by the parasite are difficult to capture in an unsynchronized culture, or even a culture that has been synchronized within a window of one to several hours. Therefore, precise synchronization of parasite cultures is of paramount importance for the investigation of these processes. Here we describe a method for synchronizing Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium knowlesi asexual blood stage parasites with ML10, a highly specific inhibitor of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) that arrests parasite growth approximately 15 minutes prior to egress. This inhibitor allows parasite cultures to be synchronized so that all parasites are within a window of development of several minutes, with a simple wash step. Furthermore, we show that parasites remain viable for several hours after becoming arrested by the compound and that ML10 has advantages, owing to its high specificity and low EC50, over the previously used PKG inhibitor Compound 2. Here, we demonstrate that ML10 is an invaluable tool for the study of Plasmodium spp. asexual blood stage biology and for the routine synchronization of P. falciparum and P. knowlesi cultures.",

To date, these approaches have relied primarily on intermolecular regulation. Here we report a computationally guided framework for engineering intramolecular regulation of protein function. We utilize this framework to develop chemically inducible activator of RAS (CIAR), a single-component RAS rheostat that directly activates endogenous RAS in response to a small molecule. Using CIAR, we show that direct RAS activation elicits markedly different RAS-ERK signaling dynamics from growth factor stimulation, and that these dynamics differ among cell types. We also found that the clinically approved RAF inhibitor vemurafenib potently primes cells to respond to direct wild-type RAS activation. These results demonstrate the utility of CIAR for quantitatively interrogating RAS signaling. Finally, we demonstrate the general utility of our approach in design of intramolecularly regulated protein tools by applying it to the Rho family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors.",

        "abstract": "nce Historically, the folding of individual proteins in buffers has been studied spectroscopically. The majority of spectroscopic methods (NMR and fluorescence excluded) cannot be used in a cell, because the protein of interest (POI) cannot be distinguished from the background proteome. Herein, we introduce folding probes, which when used in cell lysates with sufficient holdase activity, faithfully quantify the folded and functional fraction of a POI at a time point of interest in a cell by selectively reacting with that state to afford a fluorescent signal. This work provides a blueprint for how to convert enzyme inhibitors, ligands for nonenzyme proteins, etc. into folding probes to efficiently and specifically investigate how intracellular function is controlled by the proteostasis network as a function of cellular perturbations. Although much is known about protein folding in buffers, it remains unclear how the cellular protein homeostasis network functions as a system to partition client proteins between folded and functional, soluble and misfolded, and aggregated conformations. Herein, we develop small molecule folding probes that specifically react with the folded and functional fraction of the protein of interest, enabling fluorescence-based quantification of this fraction in cell lysate at a time point of interest. Importantly, these probes minimally perturb a protein’s folding equilibria within cells during and after cell lysis, because sufficient cellular chaperone/chaperonin holdase activity is created by rapid ATP depletion during cell lysis. The folding probe strategy and the faithful quantification of a particular protein’s functional fraction are exemplified with retroaldolase, a de novo designed enzyme, and transthyretin, a nonenzyme protein. Our findings challenge the often invoked assumption that the soluble fraction of a client protein is fully folded in the cell. Moreover, our results reveal that the partitioning of destabilized retroaldolase and transthyretin mutants between the aforementioned conformational states is strongly influenced by cytosolic proteostasis network perturbations. Overall, our results suggest that applying a chemical folding probe strategy to other client proteins offers opportunities to reveal how the proteostasis network functions as a system to regulate the folding and function of individual client proteins in vivo.",

        "abstract": "in design problem is to identify an amino acid sequence which folds to a desired structure. Given Anfinsen’s thermodynamic hypothesis of folding, this can be recast as finding an amino acid sequence for which the lowest energy conformation is that structure. As this calculation involves not only all possible amino acid sequences but also all possible structures, most current approaches focus instead on the more tractable problem of finding the lowest energy amino acid sequence for the desired structure, often checking by protein structure prediction in a second step that the desired structure is indeed the lowest energy conformation for the designed sequence, and discarding the in many cases large fraction of designed sequences for which this is not the case. Here we show that by backpropagating gradients through the trRosetta structure prediction network from the desired structure to the input amino acid sequence, we can directly optimize over all possible amino acid sequences and all possible structures, and in one calculation explicitly design amino acid sequences predicted to fold into the desired structure and not any other. We find that trRosetta calculations, which consider the full conformational landscape, can be more effective than Rosetta single point energy estimations in predicting folding and stability of de novo designed proteins. We compare sequence design by landscape optimization to the standard fixed backbone sequence design methodology in Rosetta, and show that the results of the former, but not the latter, are sensitive to the presence of competing low-lying states. We show further that more funneled energy landscapes can be designed by combining the strengths of the two approaches: the low resolution trRosetta model serves to disfavor alternative states, and the high resolution Rosetta model, to create a deep energy minimum at the design target structure. Significance Computational protein design has primarily focused on finding sequences which have very low energy in the target designed structure. However, what is most relevant during folding is not the absolute energy of the folded state, but the energy difference between the folded state and the lowest lying alternative states. We describe a deep learning approach which captures the entire folding landscape, and show that it can enhance current protein design methods.",

For example, low doses of 7-OH-DPAT produce conditioned place aversion and hypolocomotion, whereas psychomotor stimulants produce conditioned place preference (CPP) and hyperlocomotion. In experiment 1, the effects of low doses of 7-OH-DPAT (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) on d-amphetamine-induced (1 mg/kg) motor behaviors and CPP were assessed. In experiment 2, the effects of 0.1 mg/kg 7-OH-DPAT on d-amphetamine (0-10 mg/kg) dose-response curves for the same behaviors were examined. During conditioning, drug injections were paired with a distinct compartment, whereas saline injections were paired with another compartment. Locomotion and headbobbing were measured following acute and repeated drug administration during conditioning and place conditioning was assessed 24 h following the last conditioning day. In experiment 1, d-amphetamine-induced locomotion was dose-dependently decreased by 7-OH-DPAT following repeated administration, which was probably due to the emergence of headbobbing, a behavior not observed with d-amphetamine alone. d-Amphetamine-CPP was not altered by co-administration of 0-0.03 mg/kg 7-OH-DPAT, but was attenuated by co-administration of 0.1 mg/kg 7-OH-DPAT. In experiment 2, 7-OH-DPAT co-administered with low doses of d-amphetamine (0-0.5 mg/kg) produced a decrease in locomotion following acute administration. However, 7-OH-DPAT produced sensitization of locomotion at the 0.5 mg/kg dose of d-amphetamine and an increase in headbobbing at the 0.5-10 mg/kg doses of d-amphetamine following repeated administration. In contrast, d-amphetamine-CPP was attenuated by co-administration of 7-OH-DPAT. These findings suggest that 0.1 mg/kg 7-OH-DPAT attenuates the reinforcing effects of d-amphetamine despite enhancing stereotypic behaviors.",

Here we develop a general computational approach for designing three-dimensional protein crystals with prespecified lattice architectures at atomic accuracy that hierarchically constrains the overall number of degrees of freedom of the system. We design three pairs of oligomers that can be individually purified, and upon mixing, spontaneously self-assemble into >100 µm three-dimensional crystals. The structures of these crystals are nearly identical to the computational design models, closely corresponding in both overall architecture and the specific protein-protein interactions. The dimensions of the crystal unit cell can be systematically redesigned while retaining the space group symmetry and overall architecture, and the crystals are extremely porous and highly stable.

Crystal structures of three C2- and C3-symmetric macrocycles, and of six diverse S2-symmetric macrocycles, match the computationally-designed models with backbone heavy-atom RMSD values of 1 Å or better. Crystal structures of an S4-symmetric macrocycle (consisting of a sequence and structure segment mirrored at each of three successive repeats) designed to bind zinc reveal a large-scale zinc-driven conformational change from an S4-symmetric apo-state to a nearly inverted S4-symmetric holo-state almost identical to the design model. These symmetric structures provide promising starting points for applications ranging from design of cyclic peptide based metal organic frameworks to creation of high affinity binders of symmetric protein homo-oligomers. More generally, this work demonstrates the power of computational design for exploring symmetries and structures not found in nature, and for creating synthetic switchable systems.",

In the apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium, the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) has previously been reported to play a critical role in four key stages of the life cycle. The Plasmodium falciparum isoform (PfPKG) is essential for the initiation of gametogenesis and for blood stage schizont rupture and work on the orthologue from the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei (PbPKG) has shown additional roles in ookinete differentiation and motility as well as liver stage schizont development. In the present study, PfPKG expression and subcellular location in asexual blood stages was investigated using transgenic epitope-tagged PfPKG-expressing P. falciparum parasites. In Western blotting experiments and immunofluorescence analysis (IFA), maximal PfPKG expression was detected at the late schizont stage. While IFA suggested a cytosolic location, a degree of overlap with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was found and subcellular fractionation showed some association with the peripheral membrane fraction. This broad localisation is consistent with the notion that PfPKG, as with the mammalian orthologue, has numerous cellular substrates. This idea is further supported by the global protein phosphorylation pattern of schizonts which was substantially changed following PfPKG inhibition, suggesting a complex role for PfPKG during schizogony.",

Powerful approaches include conformational space annealing, in which search progressively focuses on the most promising regions of conformational space, and genetic algorithms, in which features of the best conformations thus far identified are recombined. We describe a new approach that combines the strengths of these two approaches. Protein conformations are projected onto a discrete feature space which includes backbone torsion angles, secondary structure, and beta pairings. For each of these there is one \"native\" value: the one found in the native structure. We begin with a large number of conformations generated in independent Monte Carlo structure prediction trajectories from Rosetta. Native values for each feature are predicted from the frequencies of feature value occurrences and the energy distribution in conformations containing them. A second round of structure prediction trajectories are then guided by the predicted native feature distributions. We show that native features can be predicted at much higher than background rates, and that using the predicted feature distributions improves structure prediction in a benchmark of 28 proteins. The advantages of our approach are that features from many different input structures can be combined simultaneously without producing atomic clashes or otherwise physically inviable models, and that the features being recombined have a relatively high chance of being correct.",

        "abstract": "Sequence--and structure-based searching strategies have proven useful in the identification of remote homologs and have facilitated both structural and functional predictions of many uncharacterized protein families. We implement these strategies to predict the structure of and to classify a previously uncharacterized cluster of orthologs (COG3019) in the thioredoxin-like fold superfamily. The results of each searching method indicate that thioltransferases are the closest structural family to COG3019. We substantiate this conclusion using the ab initio structure prediction method rosetta, which generates a thioredoxin-like fold similar to that of the glutaredoxin-like thioltransferase (NrdH) for a COG3019 target sequence. This structural model contains the thiol-redox functional motif CYS-X-X-CYS in close proximity to other absolutely conserved COG3019 residues, defining a novel thioredoxin-like active site that potentially binds metal ions. Finally, the rosetta-derived model structure assists us in assembling a global multiple-sequence alignment of COG3019 with two other thioredoxin-like fold families, the thioltransferases and the bacterial arsenate reductases (ArsC).",

Here the method is applied to a molecular-replacement problem, the structure of the protease inhibitor ecotin bound to trypsin, and a single isomorphous replacement problem, the structure of the N-terminal domain of apolipoprotein E. The starting phases for the ecotin-trypsin complex were based on a partial model (trypsin) containing 61% of the atoms in the complex. Iterative skeletonization gave better results than either solvent flattening or twofold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging as measured by the reduction in the free R factor [Brünger (1992). Nature (London), 355, 472-474]. Protection of the trypsin density during the course of the refinement greatly improved the performance of both skeletonizing and solvent flattening. In the case of apolipoprotein E, previous attempts using solvent flattening had failed to improve the SIR phases to the point of obtaining an interpretable map. The combination of iterative skeletonization and solvent flattening decreased the phase error with respect to the final refined structure, significantly more than solvent flattening alone. The final maps generated by the skeletonization procedure for both the ecotin-trypsin complex and apolipoprotein E were readily interpretable.",

Heterodimers crosslinked with interchain disulfide bonds are more stable, but it represents a formidable challenge for both the computational design of heterodimers and the manipulation of disulfide pairing for heterodimer synthesis and applications. Here, we report the design, synthesis and application of interchain disulfide-bridged peptide heterodimers with mutual orthogonality by combining computational de novo designs with a directed disulfide pairing strategy. These heterodimers can be used as not only scaffolds for generating functional molecules but chemical tools or building blocks for protein labeling and construction of crosslinking hybrids.

We fused a computationally designed protein, EED binder (EB), which competes with EZH2 and thereby inhibits PRC2 function, to dCas9 (EBdCas9) to allow for PRC2 inhibition at a precise locus using gRNA. Targeting EBdCas9 to four different genes (TBX18, p16, CDX2, and GATA3) results in precise H3K27me3 and EZH2 reduction, gene activation, and functional outcomes in the cell cycle (p16) or trophoblast transdifferentiation (CDX2 and GATA3).

Thus, they may form the basis for building a modular system, in which each repeat is complementary to a piece of the target peptide. Accordingly, preselected repeats could be assembled into specific binding proteins on demand and thereby avoid the traditional generation of every new binding molecule by an independent selection from a library. Stacked armadillo repeats, each consisting of 42 aa arranged in three α-helices, build an elongated superhelical structure. Here, we analyzed the curvature variations in natural ArmRPs and identified a repeat pair from yeast importin-α as having the optimal curvature geometry that is complementary to a peptide over its whole length. We employed a symmetric in silico design to obtain a uniform sequence for a stackable repeat while maintaining the desired curvature geometry. Computationally designed ArmRPs (dArmRPs) had to be stabilized by mutations to remove regions of higher flexibility, which were identified by molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Using an N-capping repeat from the consensus-design approach, two different crystal structures of dArmRP were determined. Although the experimental structures of dArmRP deviated from the designed curvature, the insertion of the most conserved binding pockets of natural ArmRPs onto the surface of dArmRPs resulted in binders against the expected peptide with low nanomolar affinities, similar to the binders from the consensus-design series.",

For example, their mechanical properties give insight into the stability of a particle as a function of their internal content. The mechanics can be probed by atomic force microscopy nanoindentation, and while this single particle method is increasingly used to probe material properties of viral nanocages, it has hardly been used to characterize nonviral nanocages. Here we report nanoindentation studies on two types of nonviral nanocontainers: (i) lumazine synthase from Aquifex aeolicus (AaLS), which naturally self-assembles into icosahedral cages, and (ii) the artificial protein cage O3-33 originating from a computational design approach. In addition, we tested particles that had been engineered toward improved cargo loading capacity and compared these nanocages in empty and loaded states. We found that the thermostable AaLS cages are stiffer and resist higher forces before breaking than the O3-33 particles, but that mutations affecting the size of AaLS particles have a dramatic effect on their structural stability.

We find that improvement upon averaging is not limited to explicit water MD simulation, as consistent improvements are also observed for more efficient implicit solvent MD or Monte Carlo minimization simulations. To determine the origin of these improvements, we examine the changes in model accuracy brought about by averaging at the individual residue level. We find that the improvement in model quality from averaging results from the superposition of two effects: a dampening of deviations from the correct structure in the least well modeled regions, and a reinforcement of consistent movements towards the correct structure in better modeled regions. These observations are consistent with an energy landscape model in which the magnitude of the energy gradient toward the native structure decreases with increasing distance from the native state.",

However, rapid transport of multiple electrons from the reducing end of photosystem I to downstream processes in vivo is limited by the diffusion of its native redox partner ferredoxin that is a single electron carrier. Here, we describe the design and construction of a faster electron transfer interface based on anchoring ferredoxin to the reducing end of photosystem I thereby confining the diffusion space of ferredoxin to the near vicinity of its photosystem I binding and reduction site. This was achieved by fusing ferredoxin to the PsaE subunit of photosystem I by a flexible peptide linker and reconstituting PSI in vitro with the new fusion protein. A computational algorithm was developed in order to determine the optimal linker length that will confine ferredoxin to the vicinity of photosystem I's reducing end without restricting the formation of electron transfer complexes. According to the calculation, we reconstituted photosystem I with three fusion proteins comprising PsaE and ferredoxin separated by linkers of different lengths, namely 14, 19, and 25 amino acids, and tested their effect on electron transfer rates from photosystem I to downstream processes. Indeed, we found a significant enhancement of light dependent NADPH synthesis using photosystems containing the PsaE-ferredoxin fusion proteins, equivalent to a ten-fold increase in soluble ferredoxin concentration. We propose that such a system could be used for other ferredoxin dependent redox reactions, such as the enzymatic production of hydrogen, a promising alternative fuel. As the system is comprised entirely of natural amino acids and biological cofactors, it could be integrated into the energy conversion apparatus of photosynthetic organisms by genetic engineering.",

Certain β-peptide oligomers assemble into bundles of defined octameric stoichiometry that resemble natural proteins in many respects. These β-peptide bundles are thermostable, fold cooperatively, exchange interior amide N–H protons slowly, exclude hydrophobic dyes, and can be characterized at high resolution using X-ray crystallography – just like many proteins found in nature. But unlike natural proteins, all octameric β-peptide bundles contain a sequence-uniform hydrophobic core composed of 32 leucine side chains. Here we apply rational design principles, including the Rosetta computational design methodology, to introduce sequence diversity into the bundle core while retaining the characteristic β-peptide bundle fold. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation, we confirmed the prediction that an octameric bundle still assembles upon a major remodelling of its core: the mutation of sixteen core β-homo-leucine side chains into sixteen β-homo-phenylalanine side chains. Nevertheless, the bundle containing a partially β-homo-phenylalanine core poorly protects interior amide protons from exchange, suggesting molten-globule-like properties. We further improve stability by the incorporation of eight β-homo-pentafluorophenyalanine side chains, giving an assembly with amide protection factors comparable to prior well-structured bundles. By demonstrating that their cores tolerate significant sequence variation, the β-peptide bundles reported here represent a starting point for the “bottom-up” construction of β-peptide assemblies possessing both structure and sophisticated function.",

In the second step, the residues surrounding the transition state model are optimized to increase transition state binding affinity and to bolster the primary catalytic side chains. To improve the design methodology, we investigated how the set of solutions identified by the design calculations relate to the overall set of solutions for two different chemical reactions. Using a TIM barrel scaffold in which catalytically active Kemp eliminase and retroaldolase designs were obtained previously, we carried out activity screens of random libraries made to be compositionally similar to active designs. A small number of active catalysts were found in screens of 10³ variants for each of the two reactions, which differ from the computational designs in that they reuse charged residues already present in the native scaffold. The results suggest that computational design considerably increases the frequency of catalyst generation for active sites involving newly introduced catalytic residues, highlighting the importance of interaction cooperativity in enzyme active sites.",

These enzymes have a highly conserved Arg residue in their catalytic loop which is present two residues or four residues downstream from an absolutely conserved Asp catalytic base. Prior studies on protein tyrosine kinases Csk and Src revealed the potential for chemical rescue of catalytically deficient mutant kinases (Arg to Ala mutations) by small diamino compounds, particularly imidazole; however, the potency and efficiency of rescue was greater for Src. This current study further examines the structural and kinetic basis of rescue for mutant Src as compared to mutant Abl tyrosine kinase. An X-ray crystal structure of R388A Src revealed the surprising finding that a histidine residue of the N-terminus of a symmetry-related kinase inserts into the active site of the adjacent Src and mimics the hydrogen-bonding pattern seen in wild-type protein tyrosine kinases. Abl R367A shows potent and efficient rescue more comparable to Src, even though its catalytic loop is more like that of Csk. Various enzyme redesigns of the active sites indicate that the degree and specificity of rescue are somewhat flexible, but the overall properties of the enzymes and rescue agents play an overarching role. The newly discovered rescue agent 2-aminoimidazole is about as efficient as imidazole in rescuing R/A Src and Abl. Rate vs pH studies with these imidazole analogues suggest that the protonated imidazolium is the preferred form for chemical rescue, consistent with structural models. The efficient rescue seen with mutant Abl points to the potential of this approach to be used effectively to analyze Abl phosphorylation pathways in cells.",

Observers skilled in each method measured coral cover at each site. The time required to run each transect, time required to process data and time to record the results were documented. Cost of hardware and software for each method was also tabulated. Results of this investigation indicate that all of the methods used provide a good first estimate of coral cover on a reef. However, there were differences between the methods in detecting the number of coral species. For example, the classic \"quadrat\" method allows close examination of small and cryptic coral species that are not detected by other methods such as the \"towboard\" surveys. The time, effort and cost involved with each method varied widely, and the suitability of each method for answering particular research questions in various environments was evaluated. Results of this study support the finding of three other comparison method studies conducted at various geographic locations throughout the world. Thus, coral cover measured by different methods can be legitimately combined or compared in many situations. The success of a recent modeling effort based on coral cover data consisting of observations taken in Hawai'i using the different methods supports this conclusion.",

        "abstract": "Webb Space Telescope will be able to probe the atmospheres and surface properties of hot, terrestrial planets via emission spectroscopy. We identify 18 potentially terrestrial planet candidates detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) that would make ideal targets for these observations. These planet candidates cover a broad range of planet radii (R p ∼ 0.6–2.0R ⊕) and orbit stars of various magnitudes (K s = 5.78–10.78, V = 8.4–15.69) and effective temperatures (T eff ∼ 3000–6000 K). We use ground-based observations collected through the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP) and two vetting tools—DAVE and TRICERATOPS—to assess the reliabilities of these candidates as planets. We validate 13 planets: TOI-206 b, TOI-500 b, TOI-544 b, TOI-833 b, TOI-1075 b, TOI-1411 b, TOI-1442 b, TOI-1693 b, TOI-1860 b, TOI-2260 b, TOI-2411 b, TOI-2427 b, and TOI-2445 b.

TOI-1860 is the youngest (133 ± 26 Myr) solar twin with a known planet to date. TOI-2260 is a young (321 ± 96 Myr) G dwarf that is among the most metal-rich ([Fe/H] = 0.22 ± 0.06 dex) stars to host an ultra-short-period planet.

Between 12 March 2020 and 10 January 2021, >1,170 HCP tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a major academic medical institution in the Upper Midwest of the United States. We aimed to understand the sources of infections in HCP and to evaluate the efficacy of infection control procedures used at this institution to protect HCP from healthcare-associated transmission. Methods In this retrospective case series, we used viral genomics to investigate the likely source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 96 HCP where epidemiological data alone could not be used to rule out healthcare-associated transmission. We obtained limited epidemiological data through informal interviews and review of the electronic health record. We combined viral sequence data and available epidemiological information to infer the most likely source of HCP infection. Findings We investigated 32 SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters involving 96 HCP, 140 possible patient contacts, and 1 household contact (total n = 237). Of these, 182 sequences met quality standards and were used for downstream analysis. We found the majority of HCP infections could not be linked to a patient or co-worker and therefore likely occurred in the outside community (58/96; 60.4%). We found a smaller percentage could be traced to a coworker (10/96; 10.4%) or were part of a patient-employee cluster (12/96; 12.5%). Strikingly, the smallest proportion of HCP infections could be clearly traced to a patient source (4/96; 4.2%). Interpretation Infection control procedures, consistently followed, offer significant protection to HCP caring for COVID-19 patients in a representative American academic medical institution. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in healthcare settings can be used retrospectively to reconstruct the likely source of HCP infection when epidemiological data are not available or are inconclusive. Understanding the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection can then be used prospectively to adjust and improve infection control practices and guidelines.",

A similar challenge presumably limited the emergence of large and complex protein topologies in evolution. Here, we demonstrate that protein topologies with six and seven-stranded beta sheets can be designed by insertion of one de novo designed beta sheet containing protein into another such that the two beta sheets are merged to form a single extended sheet, followed by amino acid sequence optimization at the newly formed strand-strand, strand-helix, and helix-helix interfaces. Crystal structures of two such designs closely match the computational design models. Searches for similar structures in the SCOP protein domain database yield only weak matches with different beta sheet connectivities. A similar beta sheet fusion mechanism may have contributed to the emergence of complex beta sheets during natural protein evolution.",

The discreteness of these libraries is problematic, particularly for long, polar side chains, since favorable interactions can be missed. Previously, an approach to loop remodeling where protein backbone movement is directed by side-chain rotamers predicted to form interactions previously observed in native complexes (termed \"motifs\") was described. Here, we show how such motif libraries can be incorporated into combinatorial sequence optimization protocols and improve native complex recapitulation. Guided by the motif rotamer searches, we made improvements to the underlying energy function, increasing recapitulation of native interactions. To further test the methods, we carried out a comprehensive experimental scan of amino acid preferences in the I-AniI protein-DNA interface and found that many positions tolerated multiple amino acids. This sequence plasticity is not observed in the computational results because of the fixed-backbone approximation of the model. We improved modeling of this diversity by introducing DNA flexibility and reducing the convergence of the simulated annealing algorithm that drives the design process. In addition to serving as a benchmark, this extensive experimental data set provides insight into the types of interactions essential to maintain the function of this potential gene therapy reagent.",

Identifying failures in SHPs before they happen is crucial for allowing better management of asset maintenance, lowering operating costs, and enabling the expansion of renewable energy sources. Most fault prognosis models proposed thus far for hydroelectric generating units are based on signal decomposition and regression models. In the specific case of SHPs, there is a high occurrence of data being censored, since the operation is not consistently steady and can be repeatedly interrupted due to transmission problems or scarcity of water resources. To overcome this, we propose a two-step, data-driven framework for SHP prognosis based on time series feature engineering and survival modeling. We compared two different strategies for feature engineering: one using higher-order statistics and the other using the Tsfresh algorithm. We adjusted three machine learning survival models-CoxNet, survival random forests, and gradient boosting survival analysis-for estimating the concordance index of these approaches. The best model presented a significant concordance index of 77.44%. We further investigated and discussed the importance of the monitored sensors and the feature extraction aggregations. The kurtosis and variance were the most relevant aggregations in the higher-order statistics domain, while the fast Fourier transform and continuous wavelet transform were the most frequent transformations when using Tsfresh. The most important sensors were related to the temperature at several points, such as the bearing generator, oil hydraulic unit, and turbine radial bushing.",

These approaches span a wide range of backbone motions, from limited refinement of loops to relieve clashes in homologous docking, through extensive remodeling of loop segments, to large-scale remodeling of RNA. Although the results are encouraging, major improvements in sampling and energy evaluation are clearly required for consistent high accuracy modeling.

The right side of each carcass was anatomically dissected into muscle, bone, fat and connective tissue. Correlation and regression analyses were used to identify the most accurate predictors of weight and percentage of side muscle. In simple regression, hot carcass weight and the estimate of eye muscle volume were the most accurate predictors of side muscle weight; 10th rib fat thickness and MN, a depth measurement of muscle and fat over the loin, were the most accurate predictors of percentage side muscle. In multiple regression, the addition of either eye muscle volume or eye muscle area to hot carcass weight and 10th rib fat thickness gave the most accurate predictions of side muscle weight and percentage side muscle, but in the case of each dependent variable, the improvement in accuracy was slight compared with that of the two most accurate regressors, hot carcass weight and 10th rib fat thickness. Although eye muscle volume was a more accurate predictor of side muscle weight than eye muscle area in simple regression, their contributions in multiple regression with hot carcass weight and 10th rib fat thickness were similar. None of the five linear measurements associated with m. longissimus contributed significantly to improving the prediction of weight or percentage of side muscle.",

In prior assessments, ClusPro submissions consisted of models that were produced via free docking of pre-generated homology models. This method was successful in terms of the number of acceptable predictions across targets; however, analysis of results showed that purely template-based methods produced a substantially higher number of medium-quality models for targets for which there were good templates available.

        "abstract": "The ability of stress to trigger cocaine seeking in humans and rodents is variable and is determined by the amount and pattern of prior drug use. This study examined the role of a corticotropin releasing factor (CRF)-regulated dopaminergic projection from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the prelimbic cortex in shock-induced cocaine seeking and its recruitment under self-administration conditions that establish relapse vulnerability. Male rats with a history of daily long-access (LgA; 14 × 6 h/d) but not short-access (ShA; 14 × 2 h/d) self-administration showed robust shock-induced cocaine seeking. This was associated with a heightened shock-induced prelimbic cortex Fos response and activation of cholera toxin b retro-labeled VTA neurons that project to the prelimbic cortex. Chemogenetic inhibition of this pathway using a dual virus intersectional hM4Di DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug) based approach prevented shock-induced cocaine seeking. Both shock-induced reinstatement and the prelimbic cortex Fos response were prevented by bilateral intra-VTA injections of the CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) antagonist, antalarmin. Moreover, pharmacological disconnection of the CRF-regulated dopaminergic projection to the prelimbic cortex by injection of antalarmin into the VTA in one hemisphere and the D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390, into the prelimbic cortex of the contralateral hemisphere prevented shock-induced cocaine seeking. Finally, LgA, but not ShA, cocaine self-administration resulted in increased VTA CRFR1 mRNA levels as measured using in situ hybridization. Altogether, these findings suggest that excessive cocaine use may establish susceptibility to stress-induced relapse by recruiting CRF regulation of a stressor-responsive mesocortical dopaminergic pathway.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Understanding the neural pathways and mechanisms through which stress triggers relapse to cocaine use is critical for the development of more effective treatment approaches. Prior work has demonstrated a critical role for the neuropeptide corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in stress-induced cocaine seeking. Here we provide evidence that stress-induced reinstatement in a rat model of relapse is mediated by a CRF-regulated dopaminergic projection from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that activates dopamine D1 receptors in the prelimbic cortex. Moreover, we report that this pathway may be recruited as a result of daily cocaine self-administration under conditions of extended drug access/heightened drug intake, likely as a result of increased CRFR1 expression in the VTA, thereby promoting susceptibility to stress-induced cocaine seeking.",

        "abstract": "Although many putative heme transporters have been discovered, it has been challenging to prove that these proteins are directly involved with heme trafficking in vivo and to identify their heme binding domains. The prokaryotic pathways for cytochrome c biogenesis, Systems I and II, transport heme from inside the cell to outside for stereochemical attachment to cytochrome c, making them excellent models to study heme trafficking. System I is composed of eight integral membrane proteins (CcmA-H) and is proposed to transport heme via CcmC to an external \"WWD\" domain for presentation to the membrane-tethered heme chaperone, CcmE. Herein, we develop a new cysteine/heme crosslinking approach to trap and map endogenous heme in CcmC (WWD domain) and CcmE (defining \"2-vinyl\" and \"4-vinyl\" pockets for heme). Crosslinking occurs when either of the two vinyl groups of heme localize near a thiol of an engineered cysteine residue. Double crosslinking, whereby both vinyls crosslink to two engineered cysteines, facilitated a more detailed structural mapping of the heme binding sites, including stereospecificity. Using heme crosslinking results, heme ligand identification, and genomic coevolution data, we model the structure of the CcmCDE complex, including the WWD heme binding domain. We conclude that CcmC trafficks heme via its WWD domain and propose the structural basis for stereochemical attachment of heme.",

Proteolytic degradation of Aβ is an important clearance mechanism under normal circumstances, and it has been found to be compromised in those with AD. Here, the extended substrate specificity and Aβ-degrading capacity of kallikrein 7 (KLK7), a serine protease with a unique chymotrypsin-like specificity, was characterized. Preferred peptide substrates of KLK7 identified using a bacterial display substrate library were found to exhibit a consensus motif of RXΦ(Y/F)↓(Y/F)↓(S/A/G/T) or RXΦ(Y/F)↓(S/T/A) (Φ=hydrophobic), which is remarkably similar to the hydrophobic core motif of Aβ (K16L17V18F19F20 A21) that is largely responsible for aggregation propensity. KLK7 was found to cleave after both Phe residues within the core of Aβ42 in vitro, thereby inhibiting Aβ fibril formation and promoting the degradation of preformed fibrils. Finally, the treatment of Aβ oligomer preparations with KLK7, but not inactive pro-KLK7, significantly reduced Aβ42-mediated toxicity to rat hippocampal neurons to the same extent as the known Aβ-degrading protease insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). Taken together, these results indicate that KLK7 possesses an Aβ-degrading capacity that can ameliorate the toxic effects of the aggregated peptide in vitro.",

The virulence of anthrax stems from the shielding properties of the Bacillus anthracis poly-γ-d-glutamic acid capsule. In the presence of excess CapD, a B. anthracis γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, the protective capsule is degraded, and the immune system can successfully combat infection. Although CapD shows promise as a next generation protein therapeutic against anthrax, improvements in production, stability, and therapeutic formulation are needed. In this study, we addressed several of these problems through computational protein engineering techniques. We show that circular permutation of CapD improved production properties and dramatically increased kinetic thermostability. At 45 °C, CapD was completely inactive after 5 min, but circularly permuted CapD remained almost entirely active after 30 min. In addition, we identify an amino acid substitution that dramatically decreased transpeptidation activity but not hydrolysis. Subsequently, we show that this mutant had a diminished capsule degradation activity, suggesting that CapD catalyzes capsule degradation through a transpeptidation reaction with endogenous amino acids and peptides in serum rather than hydrolysis.",

The CASP11 experiment revealed strengths and weaknesses of the approaches: the high-resolution strategy incorporating local rebuilding with core refinement consistently improved starting structures, while the low-resolution strategy incorporating the reconstruction of large parts of the structures improved starting models in some cases but often considerably worsened them, largely because of model selection issues. Overall, the results suggest the high-resolution refinement protocol is a promising method orthogonal to other approaches, while the low-resolution refinement method clearly requires further development.

When SeMet expression of the full-length gene product failed, several truncation variants were created with the aid of Ginzu, a domain-prediction method. 11 truncations were selected for expression, purification and crystallization based upon secondary-structure elements and disorder. The structure of one of these variants, Lmaj006129AAH, was solved by multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) using ELVES, an automatic protein crystal structure-determination system. This model was then successfully used as a molecular-replacement probe for the parent full-length target, Lmaj006129AAA. The final structure of Lmaj006129AAA was refined to an R value of 0.185 (Rfree = 0.229) at 1.60 A resolution.

Measurement of amide proton exchange protection during the first several milliseconds following initiation of refolding in 0.4 M sodium sulfate revealed weak protection in the first beta-hairpin and helix. A tryptophan residue was introduced into the first beta-hairpin to probe the extent of structure formation in this part of the protein; the intrinsic fluorescence of this tryptophan was found to deviate from that expected given its local sequence context in 2-3 M guanidine, suggesting some partial ordering of this region in the unfolded state ensemble. To further probe this partial ordering, dansyl groups were introduced via cysteine residues at three sites in the protein. It was found that fluorescence energy transfer from the introduced tryptophan to the dansyl groups decreased dramatically upon unfolding. Stopped-flow fluorescence studies showed that the recovery of dansyl fluorescence upon refolding occurred on a submillisecond time scale. To probe the interactions responsible for the residual structure observed in the denatured state ensemble, the conformation of a peptide corresponding to the first beta-hairpin and helix of protein L was studied using circular dichroism spectroscopy and compared to that of full-length protein L and previously characterized peptides corresponding to the isolated helix and second beta-hairpin.",

        "abstract": "Small beta barrel proteins are attractive targets for computational design because of their considerable functional diversity despite their very small size (<70 amino acids). However, there are considerable challenges to designing such structures, and there has been little success thus far. Because of the small size, the hydrophobic core stabilizing the fold is necessarily very small, and the conformational strain of barrel closure can oppose folding; also intermolecular aggregation through free beta strand edges can compete with proper monomer folding. Here, we explore the de novo design of small beta barrel topologies using both Rosetta energy-based methods and deep learning approaches to design four small beta barrel folds: Src homology 3 (SH3) and oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) topologies found in nature and five and six up-and-down-stranded barrels rarely if ever seen in nature. Both approaches yielded successful designs with high thermal stability and experimentally determined structures with less than 2.4 Å rmsd from the designed models. Using deep learning for backbone generation and Rosetta for sequence design yielded higher design success rates and increased structural diversity than Rosetta alone. The ability to design a large and structurally diverse set of small beta barrel proteins greatly increases the protein shape space available for designing binders to protein targets of interest.",

We obtained ten designs for which all three chains cooperatively assembled into heterotrimers with few or no other species present. Crystal structures of a helical bundle heterotrimer and extended versions, with helical repeat proteins fused to individual subunits, showed all three chains assembling in the designed orientation.

Commercially available rapid diagnostic tests are based upon detection of the influenza nucleoprotein, which are limited in that they are unable to differentiate by species and require an additional viral lysis step. Sample preprocessing can be minimized or eliminated by targeting the intact influenza virus, thereby reducing assay complexity and leveraging the large number of hemagglutinin proteins on the surface of each virus. Here, we report the development of a paper-based influenza assay that targets the hemagglutinin protein; the assay employs a combination of antibodies and novel computationally designed, recombinant affinity proteins as the capture and detection agents. This system leverages the customizability of recombinant protein design to target the conserved receptor-binding pocket of the hemagglutinin protein and to match the trimeric nature of hemagglutinin for improved avidity. Using this assay, we demonstrate the first instance of intact influenza virus detection using a combination of antibody and affinity proteins within a porous network. The recombinant head region binder based assays yield superior analytical sensitivity as compared to the antibody based assay, with lower limits of detection of 3.54 × 107 and 1.34 × 107 CEID50/mL for the mixed and all binder stacks, respectively. Not only does this work describe the development of a novel influenza assay, it also demonstrates the power of recombinant affinity proteins for use in rapid diagnostic assays.",

Additionally, in most organisms, recombination also plays mechanical roles in chromosomal processes, most notably to mediate pairing of homologous chromosomes during prophase and, ultimately, to ensure regular segregation of homologous chromosomes when they separate at the first meiotic division. Recombinational interactions are also subject to important spatial patterning at both early and late stages. Recombination-mediated processes occur in physical and functional linkage with meiotic axial chromosome structure, with interplay in both directions, before, during, and after formation and dissolution of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a highly conserved meiosis-specific structure that links homolog axes along their lengths. These diverse processes also are integrated with recombination-independent interactions between homologous chromosomes, nonhomology-based chromosome couplings/clusterings, and diverse types of chromosome movement. This review provides an overview of these diverse processes and their interrelationships.",

Cyclic GMP (cGMP) signaling is one of the biochemical pathways that is being explored as a potential target for new antimalarial drugs. It has been shown that this pathway is essential for all of the key developmental stages of the complex malaria parasite life cycle. This gives hope that targeting cGMP signaling might give rise to drugs that treat disease, block its transmission and even prevent the establishment of infection.

We performed Illumina whole-genome sequencing on 101 isolates from 43 stools, followed by nanopore long-read sequencing on 11 isolates. We identified 43 sequence types (STs) by the Achtman scheme (ten of which are novel), spanning five of the eight known phylogroups of E. coli. The majority of simian isolates belong to phylogroup B2 - characterized by strains that cause human extraintestinal infections - and encode factors associated with extraintestinal disease. A subset of the B2 strains (ST73, ST681 and ST127) carry the pks genomic island, which encodes colibactin, a genotoxin associated with colorectal cancer. We found little antimicrobial resistance and only one example of multi-drug resistance among the simian isolates. Hierarchical clustering showed that simian isolates from ST442 and ST349 are closely related to isolates recovered from human clinical cases (differences in 50 and 7 alleles, respectively), suggesting recent exchange between the two host species. Conversely, simian isolates from ST73, ST681 and ST127 were distinct from human isolates, while five simian isolates belong to unique core-genome ST complexes - indicating novel diversity specific to the primate niche.

Both encode cell-surface proteins involved in cell recognition and rejection of non-host tissues. MHC class I and class II genes are highly polymorphic, so comprehensive genotyping requires the development of complete databases of allelic variants. Our group used PacBio circular consensus sequencing of full-length cDNA amplicons to characterize MHC class I and class II transcript sequences for a cohort of 293 Indonesian cynomolgus macaques (ICM) in a large, pedigreed breeding colony. These studies allowed us to expand the existing database of Macaca fascicularis (Mafa) alleles by identifying an additional 141 MHC class I and 61 class II transcript sequences. In addition, we defined co-segregating combinations of allelic variants as regional haplotypes for 70 Mafa-A, 78 Mafa-B, and 45 Mafa-DRB gene clusters. Finally, we defined class I and class II transcripts that are associated with 100 extended MHC haplotypes in this breeding colony by combining our genotyping analyses with short tandem repeat (STR) patterns across the MHC region.

In this study, we accelerate this process by using an ultradense peptide array as a high-throughput tool for screening peptides to identify putative novel epitopes. In a single experiment, we directly assess the binding of four common Indian rhesus macaque MHC class I molecules (Mamu-A1*001, -A1*002, -B*008, and -B*017) to ∼61,000 8-mer, 9-mer, and 10-mer peptides derived from the full proteomes of 82 SIV and simian HIV isolates.

To assess whether the peptide array identified putative novel CD8 T cell epitopes, we validated the method by IFN-γ ELISPOT assay and found three novel peptides that induced CD8 T cell responses in at least two Mamu-A1*001-positive animals; two of these were validated by ex vivo tetramer staining.

However, an absence of evidence, i.e., large P value, is not evidence of absence, i.e., no sex differences. Equivalence testing determines whether two measures or groups provide statistically equivalent outcomes, in that they differ by less than an \"ideally prespecified\" smallest effect size of interest.

        "abstract": "The specificity of the antibody response against Zika virus (ZIKV) is not well-characterized. This is due, in part, to the antigenic similarity between ZIKV and closely related dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. Since these and other similar viruses co-circulate, are spread by the same mosquito species, and can cause similar acute clinical syndromes, it is difficult to disentangle ZIKV-specific antibody responses from responses to closely-related arboviruses in humans. Here we use high-density peptide microarrays to profile anti-ZIKV antibody reactivity in pregnant and non-pregnant macaque monkeys with known exposure histories and compare these results to reactivity following DENV infection. We also compare cross-reactive binding of ZIKV-immune sera to the full proteomes of 28 arboviruses. We independently confirm a purported ZIKV-specific IgG antibody response targeting ZIKV nonstructural protein 2B (NS2B) that was recently reported in ZIKV-infected people and we show that antibody reactivity in pregnant animals can be detected as late as 127 days post-infection (dpi). However, we also show that these responses wane over time, sometimes rapidly, and in one case the response was elicited following DENV infection in a previously ZIKV-exposed animal. These results suggest epidemiologic studies assessing seroprevalence of ZIKV immunity using linear epitope-based strategies will remain challenging to interpret due to susceptibility to false positive results. However, the method used here demonstrates the potential for rapid profiling of proteome-wide antibody responses to a myriad of neglected diseases simultaneously and may be especially useful for distinguishing antibody reactivity among closely related pathogens.",

        "abstract": "we generated protein structure models using simulated ambiguous and unambiguous nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) restraints with a two stage protocol. Low resolution models were generated guided by the unambiguous restraints using continuous chain folding for alpha and alpha‐beta proteins, and iterative annealing for all beta proteins to take advantage of the strand pairing information implicit in the restraints. The Rosetta fragment/model hybridization protocol was then used to recombine and regularize these models, and refine them in the Rosetta full atom energy function guided by both the unambiguous and the ambiguous restraints. Fifteen out of 19 targets were modeled with GDT‐TS quality scores greater than 60 for Model 1, significantly improving upon the non‐assisted predictions.

        "abstract": "Glutamate signaling is achieved by an elaborate network involving neurons and astrocytes. Hence, it is critical to better understand how neurons and astrocytes interact to coordinate the cellular regulation of glutamate signaling. In these studies, we used rat cortical cell cultures to examine whether neurons or releasable neuronal factors were capable of regulating system xc (-) (Sxc), a glutamate-releasing mechanism that is expressed primarily by astrocytes and has been shown to regulate synaptic transmission. We found that astrocytes cultured with neurons or exposed to neuronal-conditioned media displayed significantly higher levels of Sxc activity. Next, we demonstrated that the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) may be a neuronal factor capable of regulating astrocytes. In support, we found that PACAP expression was restricted to neurons, and that PACAP receptors were expressed in astrocytes. Interestingly, blockade of PACAP receptors in cultures comprised of astrocytes and neurons significantly decreased Sxc activity to the level observed in purified astrocytes, whereas application of PACAP to purified astrocytes increased Sxc activity to the level observed in cultures comprised of neurons and astrocytes. Collectively, these data reveal that neurons coordinate the actions of glutamate-related mechanisms expressed by astrocytes, such as Sxc, a process that likely involves PACAP. A critical gap in modeling excitatory signaling is how distinct components of the glutamate system expressed by neurons and astrocytes are coordinated. In these studies, we found that system xc (-) (Sxc), a glutamate release mechanism expressed by astrocytes, is regulated by releasable neuronal factors including PACAP. This represents a novel form of neuron-astrocyte communication, and highlights the possibility that pathological changes involving astrocytic Sxc may stem from altered neuronal activity.",

It has anxiolytic and nootropic (cognition enhancing) effects. It acts as a GABA-mimetic, primarily at GABA(B) and, to some extent, at GABA(A) receptors. It also stimulates dopamine receptors and antagonizes beta-phenethylamine (PEA), a putative endogenous anxiogenic. The psychopharmacological activity of phenibut is similar to that of baclofen, a p-Cl-derivative of phenibut. This article reviews the structure-activity relationship of phenibut and its derivatives. Emphasis is placed on the importance of the position of the phenyl ring, the role of the carboxyl group, and the activity of optical isomers. Comparison of phenibut with piracetam and diazepam reveals similarities and differences in their pharmacological and clinical effects. Phenibut is widely used in Russia to relieve tension, anxiety, and fear, to improve sleep in psychosomatic or neurotic patients; as well as a pre- or post-operative medication. It is also used in the therapy of disorders characterized by asthenia and depression, as well as in post-traumatic stress, stuttering and vestibular disorders.",

By releasing glutamate, system xc (-) can potentially cause excitotoxicity. However, through providing cystine to the cell, it regulates the levels of cellular glutathione (GSH), the main endogenous intracellular antioxidant, and may protect cells against oxidative stress. We tested two different compounds that deplete primary cortical cultures containing both neurons and astrocytes of intracellular GSH, L-buthionine-sulfoximine (L-BSO), and diethyl maleate (DEM). Both compounds caused significant concentration and time dependent decreases in intracellular GSH levels. However; DEM caused an increase in radiolabeled cystine uptake through system xc (-), while unexpectedly BSO caused a decrease in uptake. The compounds caused similar low levels of neurotoxicity, while only BSO caused an increase in oxidative stress. The mechanism of GSH depletion by these two compounds is different, DEM directly conjugates to GSH, while BSO inhibits γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, a key enzyme in GSH synthesis. As would be expected from these mechanisms of action, DEM caused a decrease in intracellular cysteine, while BSO increased cysteine levels. The results suggest that negative feedback by intracellular cysteine is an important regulator of system xc (-) in this culture system.",

The neural basis of augmented reinstatement may arise from more pronounced changes in plasticity required for reinstatement and/or the emergence of plasticity expressed only during a specific withdrawal period or under specific intake conditions. In this study, we examined the impact of withdrawal period duration and cocaine intake on the magnitude of cocaine-primed reinstatement and extracellular glutamate in the nucleus accumbens, which has been shown to be required for cocaine-primed reinstatement. Rats were assigned to self-administer under conditions resulting in low (2 hours/day; 0.5 mg/kg/infusion, IV) or high (6 hours/day; 1.0 mg/kg/infusion, IV) levels of cocaine intake. After 1, 21 or 60 days of withdrawal, drug seeking and extracellular glutamate levels in the nucleus accumbens were measured before and after a cocaine injection. Cocaine-reinstated lever pressing and elevated extracellular glutamate at every withdrawal time point tested, which is consistent with the conclusion that increased glutamatergic signaling in the nucleus accumbens, is required for cocaine-induced reinstatement. Interestingly, high-intake rats exhibited augmented reinstatement at every time point tested, yet failed to exhibit higher levels of cocaine-induced increases in extracellular glutamate relative to low-intake rats. Our current data indicate that augmented reinstatement in high-intake rats is not due to relative differences in extracellular levels of glutamate in the nucleus accumbens, but rather may stem from intake-dependent plasticity.",

        "abstract": "The ability of Clostridium perfringens to germinate and grow in acidified ground beef as well as in 10 commercially prepared acidified beef, pork, and poultry products was assessed. The pH of ground beef was adjusted with organic vinegar to achieve various pH values between 5.0 and 5.6; the pH of the commercial products ranged from 4.74 to 6.35. Products were inoculated with a three-strain cocktail of C. perfringens spores to achieve ca. 2-log (low) or 4-log (high) inoculum levels, vacuum packaged, and cooled exponentially from 54.4 to 7.2°C for 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, or 21 h to simulate abusive cooling; the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) recommends a cooling time of 6.5 h. Total germinated C. perfringens populations were determined after plating on tryptose-sulfite-cycloserine agar and incubating the plates anaerobically at 37°C for 48 h. In addition, C. perfringens growth from spores was assessed at an isothermal temperature of 44°C. Growth from spores was inhibited in ground beef with a pH of 5.5 or below, even during extended cooling from 54.4 to 7.2°C in 21 h. In ground beef with a pH of 5.6, the growth was >1 log after 18 h of cooling from 54.4 to 7.2°C. However, 15 h of cooling controlled the growth to <1 log, regardless of the inoculum level. In addition, no growth was observed in any product with a pH ranging from 4.74 to 5.17, both during exponential abusive cooling periods of up to 21 h and during storage for 21 h at 44°C. While <1-log growth of C. perfringens from spores was observed in the pH 5.63 product cooled exponentially from 54.4 to 7.2°C in 15 h or less, the pH 6.35 product supported growth, even after 6 h of cooling from 54.4 to 7.2°C. These challenge tests demonstrate that adjustment of ground beef to pH of 5.5 or less and of barbeque products to pH of 5.63 or less inhibits C. perfringens spore germination and outgrowth during extended cooling periods from 54.4 to 7.2°C up to 15 h. Therefore, safe cooling periods for products with homogeneous, lower pHs can be substantially longer.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the quantitative control of fatty acid desaturation during the biosynthesis of seed storage oil has become a priority area for research, as a consequence of its importance for both human health and the substitution of mineral oil for industrial applications. We have analysed the genome structure of two mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana that show substantially elevated content of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid linolenic acid in their seed oil. In one, rfc4, sequences totalling approximately 2 Mb from chromosome 2 have been duplicated and inserted into chromosome 3. In the other mutant, ife, chromosome 2 sequences totalling approximately 1.4 Mb have been duplicated and inserted into a linked position. In both cases, the duplications encompass the FAD3 locus, which encodes the linoleate desaturase responsible for the biosynthesis of linolenic acid for accumulation in seed storage oil. The results show that mutagens such as fast neutrons (used for the induction of rfc4) and T-DNA (used for the induction of ife, which is not linked to the T-DNA present in the line) can result in the duplication of very large genome segments. They also show that increasing the dosage of the FAD3-containing genomic region results in an increase in the linolenic acid content of seed oil. Consequently, screening methods for duplication of FAD3 orthologues in oil crops may be an appropriate approach for the identification of germplasm for breeding varieties with increased proportions of linolenic acid in the oil that they produce.",

To ensure the sustainability of these systems under dynamic conditions it has been proposed that technologies and infrastructure should be flexible, adaptive and robust.

Furthermore, the terms flexible, adaptive and robust are often used interchangeably, despite important differences. In this paper we will i) define the terminology, ii) provide an overview of the status of flexible infrastructure design alternatives for water and wastewater networks and treatment, and iii) develop guidelines for the selection of flexible design alternatives. Results indicate that, with the exception of Net Present Valuation methods, there is little research available on the design and evaluation of technologies that can enable flexibility. Flexible design alternatives reviewed include robust design, phased design, modular design, modular/component platform design and design for remanufacturing. As developments in the water sector are driven by slow variables (climate change, urban development), rather than market forces, it is suggested that phased design or component platform designs are suitable for responding to change, while robust design is an option when operations face highly dynamic variability.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effects of mutant ras expression on the growth and differentiation of normal human bone marrow, we used retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. A retrovirus (HR-1) containing a mutant ras gene (H12-ras) in addition to the selectable neo gene was transferred by cocultivation of a packaging cell line with long-term cultures of normal human bone marrow. Controls were established by cocultivating aliquots of the same bone marrow with a retrovirus (VSN-2) containing only neo. The efficiency of gene transfer, as determined by the percentage of G418-resistant colony-forming units-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) immediately after termination of cocultivation, was similar: 8 +/- 4% with HR-1 and 5 +/- 3% with VSN-2. After a further week in long-term culture, there was an increase in the number and percentage of G418-resistant CFU-GM in both the HR-1-infected and VSN-2-infected marrows. Thereafter, the numbers of G418-resistant CFU-GM declined, becoming undetectable at 4 weeks. The time course of the production of G418-resistant colonies was not significantly different in HR-1- and VSN-2-infected marrows, indicating that H12-ras did not alter the proliferation of normal CFU-GM. However, the total cellularity of HR-1-infected marrow cultures was significantly greater than that of VSN-2-infected marrow cultures. This was due to increased cellular proliferation of HR-1-infected cultured cells, since differential counts showed a significant increase in myeloid blast cells together with a slight reduction in mature myeloid cells in HR-1-infected marrow compared to baseline and to VSN-2-infected marrow. No leukemic blast cell colonies were grown from HR-1-infected marrows or control marrows, and HR-1 infection did not confer serum independence. These data show successful retroviral infection of normal bone marrow progenitor cells and suggest that expression of mutant H12-ras in such cells results in enhanced proliferation of early myeloid cells at the expense of differentiation.",

The principles relate local backbone structures to supersecondary-structure packing arrangements of α-helices and β-strands. Here, we test the generality of the principles by employing them to design larger proteins with five- and six- stranded β-sheets flanked by α-helices. The initial designs were monomeric in solution with high thermal stability, and the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of one was close to the design model, but for two others the order of strands in the β-sheet was swapped. Investigation into the origins of this strand swapping suggested that the global structures of the design models were more strained than the NMR structures. We incorporated explicit consideration of global backbone strain into the design methodology, and succeeded in designing proteins with the intended unswapped strand arrangements. These results illustrate the value of experimental structure determination in guiding improvement of de novo design, and the importance of consistency between local, supersecondary, and global tertiary interactions in determining protein topology. The augmented set of principles should inform the design of larger functional proteins.",

Previously, mouse IL-2 and its cognate receptor were engineered to create an orthogonal (ortho) cytokine-cytokine receptor pair capable of delivering an IL-2 signal without toxicity. Here, we engineered a human orthogonal IL-2 (ortho-hIL-2) and human orthogonal IL-2Rβ (ortho-hIL-2Rβ) pair, containing human-specific mutations. Ortho-hIL-2 is selective toward ortho-hIL-2Rβ–expressing cells with no appreciable signaling on wild-type T cells. Ortho-hIL-2 induces IL-2 receptor signaling and supports proliferation of both an IL-2–dependent cell line and primary T cells transduced to express the ortho-hIL-2Rβ. Using CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, we show that ortho-hIL-2 induces a dose-dependent increase in ortho-hIL-2Rβ+ CAR T cell expansion in vivo by as much as 1000-fold at 2 weeks after adoptive transfer into immunodeficient mice bearing CD19+ Nalm6 leukemia xenografts. Ortho-hIL-2 can rescue the antileukemic effect of an otherwise suboptimal CAR T cell dose. In addition, ortho-hIL-2 administration initiated at the time of leukemic relapse after CAR T cell therapy can rescue an otherwise failed antileukemic response. These data highlight the potential of combining an orthogonal cytokine approach with T cell–based immunotherapies to augment the antitumor efficacy of engineered T cells.",

        "abstract": "Background Whilst much sequencing effort has focused on key mammalian model organisms such as mouse and human, little is known about the relationship between genome sequencing techniques for non-model mammals and genome assembly quality. This is especially relevant to non-model mammals, where the samples to be sequenced are often degraded and of low quality. A key aspect when planning a genome project is the choice of sequencing data to generate. This decision is driven by several factors, including the biological questions being asked, the quality of DNA available, and the availability of funds. Cutting-edge sequencing technologies now make it possible to achieve highly contiguous, chromosome-level genome assemblies, but rely on high-quality high molecular weight DNA. However, funding is often insufficient for many independent research groups to use these techniques. Here we use a range of different genomic technologies generated from a roadkill European polecat (Mustela putorius) to assess various assembly techniques on this low-quality sample. We evaluated different approaches for de novo assemblies and discuss their value in relation to biological analyses. Results Generally, assemblies containing more data types achieved better scores in our ranking system. However, when accounting for misassemblies, this was not always the case for Bionano and low-coverage 10x Genomics (for scaffolding only). We also find that the extra cost associated with combining multiple data types is not necessarily associated with better genome assemblies. Conclusions The high degree of variability between each de novo assembly method (assessed from the 7 key metrics) highlights the importance of carefully devising the sequencing strategy to be able to carry out the desired analysis. Adding more data to genome assemblies does not always result in better assemblies, so it is important to understand the nuances of genomic data integration explained here, in order to obtain cost-effective value for money when sequencing genomes.",

Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuronally derived peptide that has already been demonstrated to modulate multiple aspects of glutamate signaling suggesting PACAP may also target activity of cystine-glutamate exchange via system xc-. In this study, 24-h treatment of primary cortical cultures containing neurons and glia with PACAP concentration-dependently increased system xc- function as measured by radiolabeled cystine uptake. Furthermore, the increase in cystine uptake was completely abolished by the system xc- inhibitor, (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine (CPG), attributing increases in cystine uptake specifically to system xc- activity. Time course and quantitative PCR results indicate that PACAP signaling may increase cystine-glutamate exchange by increasing expression of xCT, the catalytic subunit of system xc-. Furthermore, the potentiation of system xc- activity by PACAP occurs via a PKA-dependent pathway that is not mediated by the PAC1R, but rather the shared vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor VPAC1R. Finally, assessment of neuronal, astrocytic, and microglial-enriched cultures demonstrated that only astrocyte-enriched cultures exhibit enhanced cystine uptake following both PACAP and VIP treatment. These data introduce a novel mechanism by which both PACAP and VIP regulate system xc- activity. Synapse 68:604-612, 2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "The chemical terrorist attack is an unconventional form of terrorism with vast scope of influence, strong concealment, high technical means and severe consequences. Chemical terrorism risk refers to the uncertainty of the effects of terrorist organisations using toxic industrial chemicals/drugs and classic chemical weapons to attack the population. There are multiple risk factors infecting chemical terrorism risk, such as the threat degree of terrorist organisations, attraction of targets, city emergency response capabilities, and police defense capabilities. We have constructed a Bayesian network of chemical terrorist attacks to conduct risk analysis. The scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis are applied to validate the model and analyse the impact of the vital factor on the risk of chemical terrorist attacks. The results show that the model can be used for simulation and risk analysis of chemical terrorist attacks. In terms of controlling the risk of chemical terrorist attack, patrol and surveillance are less critical than security checks and police investigations. Security check is the most effective approach to decrease the probability of successful attacks. Different terrorist organisations have different degrees of threat, but the impacts of which are limited to the success of the attack. Weapon types and doses are sensitive to casualties, but it is the level of emergency response capabilities that dominates the changes in casualties. Due to the limited number of defensive resources, to get the best consequence, the priority of the deployment of defensive sources should be firstly given to governmental buildings, followed by commercial areas. These findings may provide the theoretical basis and method support for the combat of the public security department and the safety prevention decision of the risk management department.",

Important advances have been made in EV metrology and in understanding and applying EV biology. However, hurdles remain to realising the potential of EVs in domains ranging from basic biology to clinical applications due to challenges in EV nomenclature, separation from non-vesicular extracellular particles, characterisation and functional studies. To address the challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) updates its 'Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles', which was first published in 2014 and then in 2018 as MISEV2014 and MISEV2018, respectively. The goal of the current document, MISEV2023, is to provide researchers with an updated snapshot of available approaches and their advantages and limitations for production, separation and characterisation of EVs from multiple sources, including cell culture, body fluids and solid tissues. In addition to presenting the latest state of the art in basic principles of EV research, this document also covers advanced techniques and approaches that are currently expanding the boundaries of the field. MISEV2023 also includes new sections on EV release and uptake and a brief discussion of in vivo approaches to study EVs.

        "title": "Preschool intervention scripts: Lessons from 20 years of research and practice.",
        "abstract": "This paper reviews applications, methods, research, and practice procedures for supporting intervention implementation through scripts. The recent emphasis in education on evidence-based practice and data-based programming suggests that intervention plans will become increasingly rigorous and scrutinized. Furthermore, research in applied behavior analysis suggests that many interventions are difficult to carry out in natural school settings without specific and often considerable support. Our focus is on young children. However, the methods to be described have broad applicability and could play an important role in multidisciplinary collaboration. Key Words: Intervention Plans; Intervention Support; Intervention Adherence; Intervention Integrity; Treatment Integrity; Intervention Fidelity; Evidence-based Practice; Scripts; Preschool Classrooms, Teachers and Children Introduction Intervention scripts are used ubiquitously in behavioral intervention research and practice. In research, scripts describe knowledge of common routines and activities as well as their behavioral relationships (e.g., Abelson, 1981; Bower, Black & Turner, 1979; Fivush, 1984; Furman & Walden, 1990; Schank & Abelson, 1977). We use the term script to describe a contextualized intervention plan. In contextualizing plans, intervention steps are developed with parents and teachers, tried out, and refined as necessary. These features may make scripts different than some treatment plans. Scripted plans may be derived from information about successful patterns of interaction within activities and routines and also from intervention design principles and research (e.g., Ganz, Cook, & Earles-Vollrath, 2007; Goldstein & Cisar, 1992; Gronna, Serna, Kennedy, & Prata, 1999). Scripted plans also have the potential to demystify what may be complex processes of change for informed consent purposes. Scripts can help adults implement an intervention and they can help children by serving as models for appropriate language and actions. From 1990 to 1999 we conducted research on how to achieve effective scripted interventions (Barnett, & Air et al., 1999; Barnett, & Bell, et al., 1997; Ehrhardt, Barnett, Lentz, Stollar, & Reifin, 1996). Since that time, the procedures have been used for training professionals and providing comprehensive intervention-based services (Barnett, et al., 2002; Bonner & Barnett, 2004). A basic premise is that, since interventions are often hard to carry out by teachers and parents, scripts can help to support implementation in a way that is consistent with the research fidelity (i.e., accuracy of differentiating components) and that maintains the integrity (i.e., accuracy of implementation) of the plan (Gresham, 1989; Moncher & Prinz, 1991). As an overview, intervention-related support variables may include a problem-solving consultation process, scripts for the desired performance, coaching, feedback, and brief trials or \"tryouts\" to refine plans or compare alternative intervention conditions. Scripts are modified for appropriate levels of support to help teachers, parents, students, or others in reaching and maintaining fluency. Much of the discussion that follows pertains to the use of scripts for specific instructional methods and the development of language and social interaction skills. Language is a natural focus for intervention because it is prerequisite for complex learning (Hart & Risley, 1995) and social interaction. There is also a well-established link between levels of communicative competence and challenging behaviors (Goldstein, 2002). Furthermore, for many young children, it is not possible to isolate language from other developmental domains (Barnett, Macmann, & Carey, 1992). This paper reviews the concepts, methods, research, and applications supporting scripted interventions. Our focus is on young children. …",

        "abstract": "Computationally designed protein nanoparticles have recently emerged as a promising platform for the development of new vaccines and biologics. For many applications, secretion of designed nanoparticles from eukaryotic cells would be advantageous, but in practice, they often secrete poorly. Here we show that designed hydrophobic interfaces that drive nanoparticle assembly are often predicted to form cryptic transmembrane domains, suggesting that interaction with the membrane insertion machinery could limit efficient secretion. We develop a general computational protocol, the Degreaser, to design away cryptic transmembrane domains without sacrificing protein stability. The retroactive application of the Degreaser to previously designed nanoparticle components and nanoparticles considerably improves secretion, and modular integration of the Degreaser into design pipelines results in new nanoparticles that secrete as robustly as naturally occurring protein assemblies. Both the Degreaser protocol and the nanoparticles we describe may be broadly useful in biotechnological applications.",

De novo protein design can now generate binders with high affinity and specificity to structured proteins6,7. However, the design of interactions between proteins and short peptides with helical propensity is an unmet challenge. Here we describe parametric generation and deep learning-based methods for designing proteins to address this challenge. We show that by extending RFdiffusion8 to enable binder design to flexible targets, and to refining input structure models by successive noising and denoising (partial diffusion), picomolar-affinity binders can be generated to helical peptide targets by either refining designs generated with other methods, or completely de novo starting from random noise distributions without any subsequent experimental optimization. The RFdiffusion designs enable the enrichment and subsequent detection of parathyroid hormone and glucagon by mass spectrometry, and the construction of bioluminescence-based protein biosensors. The ability to design binders to conformationally variable targets, and to optimize by partial diffusion both natural and designed proteins, should be broadly useful.",

We used this approach to design thousands of C2 symmetric homodimers, and characterized 101 of them experimentally.

        "title": "Malaria parasite schizont egress antigen-1 plays an essential role in nuclear segregation during schizogony",
        "abstract": "Malaria parasites cause disease through repeated cycles of intraerythrocytic proliferation. Within each cycle, several rounds of DNA replication produce multinucleated forms, called schizonts, that undergo segmentation to form daughter merozoites. Upon rupture of the infected cell, the merozoites egress to invade new erythrocytes and repeat the cycle. In human malarial infections, an antibody response specific for the Plasmodium falciparum protein PF3D7_1021800 was previously associated with protection against malaria, leading to an interest in PF3D7_1021800 as a candidate vaccine antigen. Antibodies to the protein were reported to inhibit egress, resulting in it being named schizont egress antigen-1 (SEA1). A separate study found that SEA1 undergoes phosphorylation in a manner dependent upon the parasite cGMP-dependent protein kinase PKG, which triggers egress. While these findings imply a role for SEA1 in merozoite egress, this protein has also been implicated in kinetochore function during schizont development. Therefore, the function of SEA1 remains unclear. Here, we show that P. falciparum SEA1 localizes in proximity to centromeres within dividing nuclei and that conditional disruption of SEA1 expression severely impacts the distribution of DNA and formation of merozoites during schizont development, with a proportion of SEA1-null merozoites completely lacking nuclei. SEA1-null schizonts rupture, albeit with low efficiency, suggesting that neither SEA1 function nor normal segmentation is a prerequisite for egress. We conclude that SEA1 does not play a direct mechanistic role in egress but instead acts upstream of egress as an essential regulator required to ensure the correct packaging of nuclei within merozoites.IMPORTANCE Malaria is a deadly infectious disease. Rationally designed novel therapeutics will be essential for its control and eradication. The Plasmodium falciparum protein PF3D7_1021800, annotated as SEA1, is under investigation as a prospective component of a malaria vaccine, based on previous indications that antibodies to SEA1 interfere with parasite egress from infected erythrocytes. However, a consensus on the function of SEA1 is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that SEA1 localizes to dividing parasite nuclei and is necessary for the correct segregation of replicated DNA into individual daughter merozoites. In the absence of SEA1, merozoites develop defectively, often completely lacking a nucleus, and, consequently, egress is impaired and/or aberrant. Our findings provide insights into the divergent mechanisms by which intraerythrocytic malaria parasites develop and divide. Our conclusions regarding the localization and function of SEA1 are not consistent with the hypothesis that antibodies against it confer protective immunity to malaria by blocking merozoite egress.",

        "abstract": "Guanylyl cyclases (GCs) synthesize cyclic GMP (cGMP) and, together with cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, are responsible for regulating levels of this intracellular messenger which mediates myriad functions across eukaryotes. In malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp), as well as their apicomplexan and ciliate relatives, GCs are associated with a P4-ATPase-like domain in a unique bifunctional configuration. P4-ATPases generate membrane bilayer lipid asymmetry by translocating phospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet. Here, we investigate the role of Plasmodium falciparum guanylyl cyclase alpha (GCα) and its associated P4-ATPase module, showing that asexual blood-stage parasites lacking both the cyclase and P4-ATPase domains are unable to egress from host erythrocytes. GCα-null parasites cannot synthesize cGMP or mobilize calcium, a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG)-driven requirement for egress. Using chemical complementation with a cGMP analogue and point mutagenesis of a crucial conserved residue within the P4-ATPase domain, we show that P4-ATPase activity is upstream of and linked to cGMP synthesis. Collectively, our results demonstrate that GCα is a critical regulator of PKG and that its associated P4-ATPase domain plays a primary role in generating cGMP for merozoite egress.IMPORTANCE The clinical manifestations of malaria arise due to successive rounds of replication of Plasmodium parasites within red blood cells. Once mature, daughter merozoites are released from infected erythrocytes to invade new cells in a tightly regulated process termed egress. Previous studies have shown that the activation of cyclic GMP (cGMP) signaling is critical for initiating egress. Here, we demonstrate that GCα, a unique bifunctional enzyme, is the sole enzyme responsible for cGMP production during the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum and is required for the cellular events leading up to merozoite egress. We further demonstrate that in addition to the GC domain, the appended ATPase-like domain of GCα is also involved in cGMP production. Our results highlight the critical role of GCα in cGMP signaling required for orchestrating malaria parasite egress.",

        "abstract": "Antigenic variation in the globular domain of influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HA) precludes effective immunity to this major human pathogen. Although the HA stem is highly conserved between influenza virus strains, HA stem-reactive antibodies (StRAbs) were long considered biologically inert. It is now clear, however, that StRAbs reduce viral replication in animal models and protect against pathogenicity and death, supporting the potential of HA stem-based immunogens as drift-resistant vaccines. Optimally designing StRAb-inducing immunogens and understanding StRAb effector functions require thorough comprehension of HA stem structure and antigenicity. Here, we study the biogenesis of HA stem epitopes recognized in cells infected with various drifted IAV H1N1 strains using mouse and human StRAbs. Using a novel immunofluorescence (IF)-based assay, we find that human StRAbs bind monomeric HA in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and trimerized HA in the Golgi complex (GC) with similar high avidity, potentially good news for producing effective monomeric HA stem immunogens. Though HA stem epitopes are nestled among several N-linked oligosaccharides, glycosylation is not required for full antigenicity. Rather, as N-linked glycans increase in size during intracellular transport of HA through the GC, StRAb binding becomes temperature-sensitive, binding poorly to HA at 4°C and well at 37°C. A de novo designed, 65-residue protein binds the mature HA stem independently of temperature, consistent with a lack of N-linked oligosaccharide steric hindrance due to its small size. Likewise, StRAbs bind recombinant HA carrying simple N-linked glycans in a temperature-independent manner. Chemical cross-linking experiments show that N-linked oligosaccharides likely influence StRAb binding by direct local effects rather than by globally modifying the conformational flexibility of HA. Our findings indicate that StRAb binding to HA is precarious, raising the possibility that sufficient immune pressure on the HA stem region could select for viral escape mutants with increased steric hindrance from N-linked glycans.",

He thoroughly discusses the work of more than fifty contemporary poets, including T. R. Hummer, Miller Williams, Albert Goldbarth, Jane Kenyon, Galway Kinnell, Charles Simic, Ted Kooser, David Wojahn, Alice Fulton, Louise Gluck, and Charles Wright. He takes as his models some of the great critical books of the past three decades, especially Richard Howard's masterpiece, Alone with America, and Helen Vendler's Part of Nature, Part of Us, as well as other works by Laurence Lieberman, Majorie Perloff, Carol Muske, and Mary Kinzie. At its center, Heresy and the Ideal is based on Baker's sense of Romantic poetics, especially on how contemporary poets have applied, altered, or rejected certain Romantic principles. He uses the Romantic trope to measure the tension between passion and reason and between the problems of literary transcendence and the obligations of social engagement. The result is a welcome variety of enlightening, practical criticism devoid of exclusionary jargon and based on persistent attention to an individual poem or book of poems. Utilizing the essay-review, Baker considers each poet's purposes and achievements. He blends the strategies of explanation, analysis, and evaluation, clarifying each poet's work instead of complaining or condemning. Heresy and the Ideal addresses a wide and diverse range of contemporary poetry and should take a deserved place both as a critical introduction to the work of many important poets and as a work that documents and explores the shape of poetry at the end of the millennium.",

The hairpin uses 4-mercaptoproline as a novel staple component, which contributes to a unique, kinked structure. The stapled hairpins show a high degree of structure in aqueous solution, excellent resistance to degradation in cell lysates, and cytosolic penetration at micromolar concentrations. They also overlay with a unique subset of kinked hairpin motifs at protein-protein interaction interfaces. Thus, these scaffolds represent promising starting points for developing inhibitors of cellular protein-protein interactions.",

In this study, we investigated the function of the intracellular domain (ICD) of the Notch ligand Delta-like 4 (DLL4). We provide evidence that the DLL4 ICD is required for normal DLL4 subcellular localization. We further show that it is cleaved and interacts with the JUN proto-oncogene, which forms part of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex. Mechanistically, the DLL4 ICD inhibited JUN binding to DNA and thereby controlled the expression of JUN target genes, including DLL4 Our work further demonstrated that JUN strongly stimulates endothelial cell tube formation and that DLL4 constrains this process.

CD4 consists of a cytoplasmic tail, one transmembrane region, and four extracellular domains, D1-D4. A construct consisting of the first two domains of CD4 (CD4D12) is folded and binds gp120 with similar affinity as soluble 4-domain CD4 (sCD4). However, the first domain alone (CD4D1) was previously shown to be largely unfolded and had 3-fold weaker affinity for gp120 when compared to sCD4 [Sharma, D.; et al. (2005) Biochemistry 44, 16192-16202]. We now report the design and characterization of three single-site mutants of CD4D12 (G6A, L51I, and V86L) and one multisite mutant of CD4D1 (G6A/L51I/L5K/F98T). G6A, L51I, and V86L are cavity-filling mutations while L5K and F98T are surface mutations which were introduced to minimize the aggregation of CD4D1 upon removal of the second domain. Two mutations, G6A and V86L in CD4D12 increased the stability and yield of the protein relative to the wild-type protein. The mutant CD4D1 (CD4D1a) with the 4 mutations was folded and more stable compared to the original CD4D1, but both bound gp120 with comparable affinity. In in vitro neutralization assays, both CD4D1a and G6A-CD4D12 were able to neutralize diverse HIV-1 viruses with similar IC(50)s as 4-domain CD4.

The term transparency, however, relates to multiple concepts, fulfills many functions, and holds different promises that struggle to be realized in concrete applications. Indeed, the complexity of transparency for ADM shows tension between transparency as a normative ideal and its translation to practical application. To address this tension, we first conduct a review of transparency, analyzing its challenges and limitations concerning automated decision-making practices. We then look at the lessons learned from the development of Privacy by Design, as a basis for developing the Transparency by Design principles.

Thus, although the architecture of RFjoint was developed to address the protein design problem of scaffolding functional motifs, RFjoint acquired an understanding of the mutational landscapes of proteins during model training that is equivalent to that of recently developed large protein language models. The ability to simultaneously reason over protein structure and sequence could enable even more precise mutation effect predictions following supervised training on the task.

In the absence of high-resolution structures of homologues, only coarse-grained structural features are typically inferred from these maps, and it is often impossible to assign specific regions of density to individual protein subunits. This paper describes a new method for overcoming these difficulties that integrates predicted residue distance distributions from a deep-learned convolutional neural network, computational protein folding using Rosetta, and automated EM-map-guided complex assembly. We apply this method to a 4.6 Å resolution cryoEM map of Fanconi Anemia core complex (FAcc), an E3 ubiquitin ligase required for DNA interstrand crosslink repair, which was previously challenging to interpret as it comprises 6557 residues, only 1897 of which are covered by homology models. In the published model built from this map, only 387 residues could be assigned to the specific subunits with confidence. By building and placing into density 42 deep-learning-guided models containing 4795 residues not included in the previously published structure, we are able to determine an almost-complete atomic model of FAcc, in which 5182 of the 6557 residues were placed. The resulting model is consistent with previously published biochemical data, and facilitates interpretation of disease-related mutational data. We anticipate that our approach will be broadly useful for cryoEM structure determination of large complexes containing many subunits for which there are no homologues of known structure.",

To gain a better understanding of the nature of TopBP1 BRCT6 interactions, we solved the crystal structure of BRCT6 to 1.34 A. The crystal structure reveals a degenerate phospho-peptide binding pocket and lacks conserved hydrophobic residues involved in packing of tandem BRCT repeats, which, together with results from phospho-peptide binding studies, strongly suggest that TopBP1 BRCT6 independently does not function as a phospho-peptide binding domain. We further provide insight into poly(ADP-ribose) binding and sites of potential modification by PARP-1.",

        "abstract": "Tropical fruits represent one of the most important crops in the world. The continuously growing global market for the main tropical fruits is currently estimated at 84 million tons, of which approximately half is lost or wasted throughout the whole processing chain. Developing novel processes for the conversion of these byproducts into value-added products could provide a viable way to manage this waste problem, aiming at the same time to create a sustainable economic growth within a bio-economy perspective. Given the ever-increasing concern about sustainability, complete valorization through a bio-refinery approach, that is, zero waste concept, as well as the use of green techniques is therefore of utmost importance. This paper aims to report the status on the valorization of tropical fruit byproducts within a bio-refinery frame, via the application of traditional methodologies, and with specific attention to the extraction of phenolics and carotenoids as bioactive compounds. The different types of byproducts, and their content of bioactives is reviewed, with a special emphasis on the lesser-known tropical fruits. Moreover, the bioactivity of the different types of extracts and their possible application as a resource for different sectors (food, pharmaceutical, and environmental sciences) is discussed. Consequently, this review presents the concepts of tropical fruit biorefineries, and the potential applications of the isolated fractions.",

The rapid formation of detrimental compounds at a gold-aluminium interface prohibits the use of the gold wire-aluminium film ball bond in the fabrication of long life transistors and the all-aluminium chisel bond is considered to be relatively unreliable. A study of the plastic flow of metal which occurs during the formation of a thermocompression bond has led to the development of a new bond structure, the eyelet bond, which enables aluminium wires to be bonded successfully to a number of substrates, including heavily oxidized aluminium films and both clean and lightly oxidized Kovar surfaces with high and very reproducible bond strengths. Transistors in which the new structure has been used for bonding aluminium wires to the aluminium contact areas and to the plain Kovar posts have now been stored at a temperature of 300°c for 1000 hours. The initial characteristics have remained virtually unchanged and no deterioration in mechanical reliability has been observed.",

We use this approach to generate ensembles for the cancer relevant protein K-Ras, train the VAE on a subset of the available K-Ras crystal structures and MD simulation snapshots, and assess the extent of sampling close to crystal structures withheld from training. We find that our latent space sampling procedure rapidly generates ensembles with high structural quality and is able to sample within 1 Å of held-out crystal structures, with a consistency higher than that of MD simulation or AlphaFold2 prediction. The sampled structures sufficiently recapitulate the cryptic pockets in the held-out K-Ras structures to allow for small molecule docking.",

We hypothesized that heterogeneous nucleation of calcium carbonate could be achieved by a structured flat molecular template that pre-organizes calcium ions on its surface. To test this hypothesis, we design helical repeat proteins (DHRs) displaying regularly spaced carboxylate arrays on their surfaces and find that both protein monomers and protein-Ca2+ supramolecular assemblies directly nucleate nano-calcite with non-natural {110} or {202} faces while vaterite, which forms first in the absence of the proteins, is bypassed. These protein-stabilized nanocrystals then assemble by oriented attachment into calcite mesocrystals. We find further that nanocrystal size and polymorph can be tuned by varying the length and surface chemistry of the designed protein templates. Thus, bio-mineralization can be programmed using de novo protein design, providing a route to next-generation hybrid materials.",

Here, we develop a computational approach for designing conjugates of lariat-shaped macrocyclized peptides and a small molecule opioid ligand. We demonstrate its feasibility by discovering chemical scaffolds for the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) with desired pharmacological activities. The designed De Novo Cyclic Peptide (DNCP)-β-naloxamine (NalA) exhibit in vitro potent mixed KOR agonism/mu-opioid receptor (MOR) antagonism, nanomolar binding affinity, selectivity, and efficacy bias at KOR. Proof-of-concept in vivo efficacy studies demonstrate that DNCP-β-NalA(1) induces a potent KOR-mediated antinociception in male mice. The high-resolution cryo-EM structure (2.6 Å) of the DNCP-β-NalA-KOR-Gi1 complex and molecular dynamics simulations are harnessed to validate the computational design model. This reveals a network of residues in ECL2/3 and TM6/7 controlling the intrinsic efficacy of KOR. In general, our computational de novo platform overcomes extensive lead optimization encountered in ultra-large library docking and virtual small molecule screening campaigns and offers innovation for GPCR ligand discovery.

The advantage of this system is that it enables production of uniformly 13 C- and 15 N-labeled peptides for solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies. This expression system was used to isotopically label two previously reported de novo designed peptides, and to determine their solution structures using NMR. The ensemble of NMR structures calculated for both peptides agreed well with the design models, further confirming the accuracy of the design protocol. Collection of NMR data on the peptides under reducing conditions revealed a dependency on disulfide bonds to maintain stability. Furthermore, we performed long-time molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with tempering to assess the stability of two families of de novo designed peptides. Initial designs which exhibited a stable structure during simulations were more likely to adopt a stable structure in vitro, but attempts to utilize this method to redesign unstable peptides to fold into a stable state were unsuccessful.

The latter flexible backbone protocol generated designs with shape complementarity approaching that of native homo-oligomers, but experimental characterization showed that the fixed backbone designs were more stable and less aggregation prone. Designed C2 oligomers with β-strand backbone interactions were structurally confirmed through x-ray crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). In contrast, C3-C5 designed homo-oligomers with primarily nonpolar residues at interfaces all formed a range of oligomeric states.

This approach was employed to alter the binding and cleavage specificity of the I-Anil LHE to recognize a mutation in the mouse Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene causative for mouse X-linked immunodeficiency (XID)-a model of human X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). The required re-targeting of I-AniI involved progressive resculpting of the DNA contact interface to accommodate nine base differences from the native cleavage sequence. The enzyme emerging from the progressive engineering process was specific for the XID mutant allele versus the wild-type (WT) allele, and exhibited activity equivalent to WT I-AniI in vitro and in cellulo reporter assays. Fusion of the enzyme to a site-specific DNA binding domain of transcription activator-like effector (TALE) resulted in a further enhancement of gene editing efficiency.

We show that cortical clustering of any Par complex subunit is sufficient to trigger complex assembly and that the primary kinetic barrier to complex assembly is the relief of Par6 autoinhibition.

Previously, mouse IL-2 and its cognate receptor were engineered to create an orthogonal (ortho) cytokine-cytokine receptor pair capable of delivering an IL-2 signal without toxicity. Here, we engineered a human orthogonal IL-2 (ortho-hIL-2) and human orthogonal IL-2Rβ (ortho-hIL-2Rβ) pair, containing human-specific mutations. Ortho-hIL-2 is selective toward ortho-hIL-2Rβ–expressing cells with no appreciable signaling on wild-type T cells. Ortho-hIL-2 induces IL-2 receptor signaling and supports proliferation of both an IL-2–dependent cell line and primary T cells transduced to express the ortho-hIL-2Rβ. Using CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, we show that ortho-hIL-2 induces a dose-dependent increase in ortho-hIL-2Rβ+ CAR T cell expansion in vivo by as much as 1000-fold at 2 weeks after adoptive transfer into immunodeficient mice bearing CD19+ Nalm6 leukemia xenografts. Ortho-hIL-2 can rescue the antileukemic effect of an otherwise suboptimal CAR T cell dose. In addition, ortho-hIL-2 administration initiated at the time of leukemic relapse after CAR T cell therapy can rescue an otherwise failed antileukemic response.

The ability to produce chronic infections makes it particularly useful for investigating the development of anti- Plasmodium immunity, as well as features associated with parasite virulence during both the acute and chronic phases of infection. P. chabaudi also undergoes asexual maturation (schizogony) and erythrocyte invasion in culture, so offers an experimentally-amenable in vivo to in vitro model for studying gene function and drug activity during parasite replication. To extend the usefulness of this model, we have further optimised transfection protocols and plasmids for P. chabaudi and generated stable, fluorescent lines that are free from drug-selectable marker genes. These mother-lines show the same infection dynamics as wild-type parasites throughout the lifecycle in mice and mosquitoes; furthermore, their virulence can be increased by serial blood passage and reset by mosquito transmission. We have also adapted the large-insert, linear PlasmoGEM vectors that have revolutionised the scale of experimental genetics in another rodent malaria parasite and used these to generate barcoded P. chabaudi gene-deletion and -tagging vectors for transfection in our fluorescent P. chabaudi mother-lines. This produces a tool-kit of P. chabaudi lines, vectors and transfection approaches that will be of broad utility to the research community.",

Computational design is one method for accomplishing this goal. In this chapter, we present the current state of protein-DNA interface design with the Rosetta macromolecular modeling program. The LAGLIDADG endonuclease family of DNA-cleaving enzymes, under study as potential gene therapy reagents, has been the main testing ground for these in silico protocols. At this time, the computational methods are most useful for designing endonuclease variants that can accommodate small numbers of target site substitutions. Attempts to engineer for more extensive interface changes will likely benefit from an approach that uses the computational design results in conjunction with a high-throughput directed evolution or screening procedure. The family of enzymes presents an engineering challenge because their interfaces are highly integrated and there is significant coordination between the binding and catalysis events. Future developments in the computational algorithms depend on experimental feedback to improve understanding and modeling of these complex enzymatic features. This chapter presents both the basic method of design that has been successfully used to modulate specificity and more advanced procedures that incorporate DNA flexibility and other properties that are likely necessary for reliable modeling of more extensive target site changes.",

        "title": "Who knew Australians were so co-operative? The size and scope of mutually owned co-ops in Australia",
        "abstract": "ight in every ten Australians belonging to a co-op or mutual such as the NRMA or AustralianSuper, only 16 per cent realise it, according to this paper which maps the size and scope of mutually owned co-ops in Australia. Eight in every ten Australians are a member of a co-operatively owned, or mutually owned enterprise (co-ops and mutuals) such as a road side assistance organisation (NRMA, RACV), a member-owned superannuation fund (AustralianSuper), a mutually owned bank (such as bankmecu) or a consumer cooperative (Co-op Bookshop). Similarly, large businesses such as the dairy co-operative Murray Goulburn or the giant grain handling enterprise Co-operative Bulk Handling are collectively owned by the farmers who supply them. A defining feature of co-operatives is their democratic nature. They are owned and controlled by their members, and they apply co-operative principles and values in their day-to-day activities. The combination of a high degree of community participation in co-ops, a low level of public awareness of their own participation, and the ongoing willingness of millions of customers to spend billions of dollars paying higher prices than necessary for goods and services creates a substantial opportunity for both the co-op sector and policy makers to reduce the cost of living for most Australians. Despite the widespread membership of co-ops, and the size and economic significance of the sector, community awareness of the sector runs far behind community reliance on the sector. Indeed, according to a survey conducted by The Australia Institute despite the fact that 79 per cent of people are members of a co-op only three in ten Australians could name a co-operative or mutually owned enterprise and only 16 per cent of Australians believe that they are a member of one. The widespread community reliance on co-ops and mutual organisations suggests that these enterprises have significant advantages over their for-profit rivals. In relation to home mortgages, for example, members of mutually owned banks, credit unions and building societies are estimated to save an average of 0.4 per cent on their mortgage interest rate which, for an average loan, generates savings of $76,417 over the life of the loan and reduces the repayment period by three years. The vast majority of Australians believe that privately owned for-profit companies are more interested in shareholder profit than customers (90 per cent), that large shareholders have too much influence (88 per cent) and that corporate executives are overpaid (92 per cent). However, despite these beliefs most Australians do not seek out co-operatively or mutually owned alternatives. For example, as discussed above even when substantial financial savings are available many Australians do not switch from the 'big four' banks to their mutually owned competitors. In recent years many for-profit companies in Australia have begun to emphasise the contribution that they make to Australian communities. Mining companies and the big four banks, for example, extensively promote any contributions they make to communities even though such contributions represent a very small proportion of total profit. That said, the willingness of for-profit companies to spend large amounts of money on advertising suggests that the community as a whole is likely to value and admire such contributions. Co-operatively and mutually owned enterprises on the other hand typically invest the surplus they generate into the community or return it to their members. As such, these organisations spend far less money advertising the contribution they make to the community and therefore there is far lower awareness of this contribution. Of course, the relative lack of expenditure on advertising means that the cost of providing services to members is significantly lower. The big four banks spent more than $1 billion on advertising in 2011, all of which was in turn passed on to their customers through higher interest rates and fees. Ironically, the lower level of expenditure on advertising by co-ops and mutuals means that many members, and potential members, are unaware of the low prices and high quality services that are often available. The relatively high level of consumer satisfaction with co-operatively and mutually owned enterprises and relatively high levels of consumer loyalty, do however, combine to create a circumstance in which such organisations can promote the advantages, to consumers and the community, of their ownership structures without having to match the expense incurred by their privately owned competitors. These opportunities include the following: 1) Better explain their ownership structure, and its benefits, to their existing customers. 2) Better explain the contribution that mutuals and co-ops make to the community. The mutual sector could highlight its contribution to society by creating a central registry of community support. Similarly, the mutual sector needs to measure, and promote, its contribution to the building of social capital which, in addition to the economic contribution described above, contributes to community wellbeing and resilience. 3) Government ministers and government departments should pay greater attention to the benefits to consumers and communities that flow from co-operatives. They should also do more to overcome the pragmatic or psychological barriers that prevent consumers switching to mutually owned enterprises. The fact that so many Australians are members of co-ops and mutuals yet so few are aware of this fact is both a challenge and an opportunity for the sector. While it is unclear why so few members are aware of their membership, the fact that they remain members suggests that the quality and price of the service alone is sufficient to retain their custom. If the mutual and co-op sector can succeed in explaining the broader benefits of membership then it is likely that not only will their existing members become even more supportive, but that they will more readily consider a wider range of mutual and co-operatively provided goods and services. 2012 is the International Year of the Co-operative. There are one billion members of co-ops and mutuals around the world. Co-operative businesses can be traced back to the late fifteenth century while the first modern co-operatives emerged in Rochdale, England in 1844 with the founding of the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, which allowed members access to food at more affordable prices. Today, both around the world and in Australia, mutuals and co-operatives continue to provide a wide range of goods and services while delivering tangible benefits to their communities and returns to their members. Co-ops range in size and scope from small locally oriented groups formed to improve access to low cost, locally grown food to nationwide member-owned superannuation funds managing tens of billions of dollars' worth of members' funds. As discussed above, the majority of Australians believe that shareholder-owned companies are too focussed on profit and not concerned enough with their customers. Similarly, since the recent meltdown of the financial system during the Global Financial Crisis many Australians have expressed their desire for change and the development of 'an alternative'. Paradoxically, many of those people who express a desire for something new are likely to be members of at least one such alternative.",

High-throughput multiplex markers that are robust and reproducible can contribute to both efficiency and accuracy.

This method is illustrated for multiplexed SSAP markers based on retrotransposon insertions of pea and is applicable for the rapid and efficient generation of markers from genomes where repetitive element sequence information is available for primer design. We cross-reference SSAP markers previously generated using the 33P manual PAGE system to fluorescent peaks, and use these high-throughput fluorescent SSAP markers for further genetic studies in Pisum.",

ABS, together with fifteen (15) participating organizations, initiated the Fatigue of Corroded Chains (FoCCs) Joint Industry Project (JIP) in 2016. The objective of the FoCCs JIP is to investigate methodologies for assessing remaining fatigue life of the corroded mooring chain used for floating production systems. The JIP scope includes fatigue testing in labs and finite element analysis (FEA) of corroded chain samples retrieved from six floating production facilities in West Africa and the North Sea. The participating organizations include oil majors, chain manufactures, consulting firms, and classification societies, which represent a pool of broad range of mooring knowledge and experience. Knowledge gained from the JIP will be summarized and used toward the development of guidance notes for assessing fatigue life of corroded mooring chain for the industry.\n Six sets of mooring chain samples with different corrosion conditions have been collected, cleaned and digitally scanned for fatigue testing and FEA. Procedures for testing and analysis have been developed with the objective of establishing commonly accepted methods. Different FEA procedures have been studied for making a better prediction of stress ranges of the corroded chain links. The findings from the fatigue testing and FEA will be utilized as basis for further development of the methods for fatigue assessment of corroded mooring chain. This paper summarizes the tests and FE analysis work for the selected chain samples. The JIP research work has found that corrosion, either general corrosion or local/pitting corrosion, can significantly reduce the chain fatigue capacity. The location and the geometry of corrosion pits have more impact on fatigue lives than the pit size. The JIP study has shown that FE analysis is an effective tool to capture the hot spot of corroded chain links and can provide insight in their fatigue performance. Different methods on the assessment of the stress range of a hot spot are compared and discussed.",

This algorithm also seems to gradually open more forms of variation and more selection paths over time, leading to a higher level of free energy rate density, or what we know as ‘complexity’. In fact the complexity of the object under discussion seems to correspond to the available number of selection paths.

        "abstract": "The construction of recombinant fusion/chimeric proteins has been widely used for expression of soluble proteins and protein purification in a variety of fields of protein engineering and biotechnology. Fusion proteins are constructed by the linking of two protein domains with a peptide linker. The selection of a linker sequence is important for the construction of stable and bioactive fusion proteins. Empirically designed linkers are generally classified into two categories according to their structural features: flexible linkers and rigid linkers. Rigid linkers with the α-helix-forming sequences A(EAAAK)nA (n=2-5) were first designed about two decades ago to control the distance between two protein domains and to reduce their interference. Thereafter, the helical linkers have been applied to the construction of many fusion proteins to improve expression and bioactivity. In addition, the design of fusion proteins that self-assemble into supramolecular complexes is useful for nanobiotechnology and synthetic biology. A protein that forms a self-assembling oligomer was fused by a rigid helical linker to another protein that forms another self-assembling oligomer, and the fusion protein symmetrically self-assembled into a designed protein nanoparticle or nanomaterial. Moreover, to construct chain-like polymeric nanostructures, extender protein nanobuilding blocks were designed by tandemly fusing two dimeric de novo proteins with helical or flexible linkers. The linker design of fusion proteins can affect conformation and dynamics of self-assembling nanostructures. The present review and methods focus on useful helical linkers to construct bioactive fusion proteins and protein-based nanostructures.",

We developed a new web server, EvoDesign, to design optimal protein sequences of given scaffolds along with multiple sequence and structure-based features to assess the foldability and goodness of the designs. EvoDesign uses an evolution-profile-based Monte Carlo search with the profiles constructed from homologous structure families in the Protein Data Bank.

        "abstract": "The function of proteins as biological nanomachines relies on their ability to fold into complex 3D structures, bind selectively to partners, and undergo conformational changes on cue. The native functional structures, and the rates of interconversion between conformational states (folded-unfolded, bound-free), are all encoded in the physical chemistry of their amino acid sequence. However, despite extensive research over decades, this code has proven difficult to fully crack, in terms of both prediction and understanding the molecular mechanisms at play.Earlier work on single-domain proteins reported a commonality of slow rates (10-2-102 s-1) and simple behavior in both kinetic and thermodynamic unfolding experiments, which suggested the process was all-or-none and thereby analogous to a chemical reaction (e.g., A ⇄ B). In the absence of a first-principles pre-exponential factor for protein (un)folding dynamics, the rates could only be interpreted in relative terms, e.g., the changes induced by mutation, and hence, neither the height of nor the entropic contribution to the free energy barriers was known. The rates were also many orders of magnitude too slow for direct atomistic simulations, and the computational focus was on predicting rate changes induced by mutation via coarse grained simulations. However, even the effects of mutation proved to be strikingly homogeneous with all experimental data clustering at ∼1/3 of the free energy perturbation recovered on folding and ∼2/3 on unfolding.The implementation of ultrafast kinetic methods turned the field upside down because they allowed researchers to measure the time scales of elementary (un)folding motions, which set the pre-exponential factor for protein conformational transitions at ∼1 μs. In parallel, we and others set out to investigate the simplest possible protein structures capable of autonomous folding, which we defined as archetypal folds. The rationale was to recapitulate the hierarchical organization of protein structure, starting from the bottom up. The study of fold archetypes ended up opening new research avenues in protein (un)folding, but also making unexpected connections with the folding upon binding of intrinsically disordered proteins and suggesting their functioning as conformational rheostats.This Account describes our work on the kinetic, thermodynamic, mechanistic, and functional analysis of fold archetypes. We first discuss the kinetic studies, emphasizing their impact on our understanding of (un)folding rates, of barrierless (downhill) folding, and as benchmarks for atomistic simulations. We continue with the thermodynamic analysis, introducing the differential scanning calorimetry, multiprobe, and NMR approaches that we developed to dissect their gradual, minimally cooperative (un)folding transitions and to probe the underlying mechanisms with unprecedented detail. The last two sections cover single-molecule analyses and some recent, mostly computational, results on the exploration of possible biological and technological roles for the gradual conformational transitions of fold archetypes.",

Current engineering approaches for nanopore sensors are limited to naturally occurring channels such as CsgG, which have evolved to carry out functions very different from sensing, and hence provide sub-optimal starting points. In contrast, de novo protein design can in principle create an unlimited number of new nanopores with any desired properties. Here we describe a general approach to the design of transmembrane β-barrel pores with different diameter and pore geometry. NMR and crystallographic characterization shows that the designs are stably folded with structures close to the design models. We report the first examples of de novo designed TMBs with 10, 12 and 14 stranded β-barrels. The designs have distinct conductances that correlate with their pore diameter, ranging from 110 pS (~0.5 nm pore diameter) to 430 pS (~1.1 nm pore diameter), and can be converted into sensitive small-molecule sensors with high signal to noise ratio. The capability to generate on demand β-barrel pores of defined geometry opens up fundamentally new opportunities for custom engineering of sequencing and sensing technologies.",

The cryogenic electron microscopy structure of an optimized design is nearly identical to the computational design model for both the subunit internal geometry and the subunit packing into the fibre. Electron, fluorescent and atomic force microscopy characterization reveal a sharp and reversible transition from assembled to disassembled fibres over 0.3 pH units, and rapid fibre disassembly in less than 1 s following a drop in pH. The midpoint of the transition can be tuned by modulating buried histidine-containing hydrogen bond networks. Computational protein design thus provides a route to creating unbound nanomaterials that rapidly respond to small pH changes.",

We describe a computational method for the design of small DBPs that recognize specific target sequences through interactions with bases in the major groove, and employ this method in conjunction with experimental screening to generate binders for 5 distinct DNA targets. These binders exhibit specificity closely matching the computational models for the target DNA sequences at as many as 6 base positions and affinities as low as 30-100 nM. The crystal structure of a designed DBP-target site complex is in close agreement with the design model, highlighting the accuracy of the design method.

        "abstract": "Asexual blood-stage malaria parasites must produce sexual progeny to infect mosquitoes. It is important to understand the scope and causes of intraspecific variation in sexual commitment rates, particularly for the major human parasite P. falciparum. First, two alternative assay methods of measuring sexual commitment were compared to test a genetically modified P. falciparum line with elevated commitment rates inducible by overexpression of GDV1. The methods yielded correlated measurements with higher sensitivity and precision being achieved by one employing detection of the early gametocyte differentiation marker Pfs16. Thus, this was used to survey a diverse range of parasite lines and test each in multiple biological replicate assays in a serum-free medium supplemented with Albumax. There were differences among six recent clinical isolates from Ghana in their mean rates of sexual commitment per cycle, ranging from 3.3% to 12.2%. Among 13 diverse long-term laboratory-adapted lines, mean sexual commitment rates for most ranged from 4.7% to 13.4%, a few had lower rates with means from 0.3 to 1.6%, and one with a nonfunctional ap2-g gene always showed zero commitment. Among a subset of lines tested for the effects of exogenous choline to suppress commitment, there were significant differences. As expected, there was no effect in a line that had lost the gdv1 gene and that had generally low commitment, whereas the others showed quantitatively variable but significant responses to choline, suggesting potential trait variation. The results indicated the value of performing multiple replicate assays for understanding the variation of this key reproductive trait that likely affects transmission. IMPORTANCE Only sexual-stage malaria parasites are transmitted from human blood to mosquitoes. Thus, it is vital to understand variations in sexual commitment rates because these may be modifiable or susceptible to blocking. Two different methods of commitment rate measurement were first compared, demonstrating higher sensitivity and precision by the detection of an early differentiation marker, which was subsequently used to survey diverse lines. Clinical isolates from Ghana showed significant variation in mean per-cycle commitment rates and variation among biological replicates. Laboratory-adapted lines of diverse origins had a wider range with most being within the range observed for the clinical isolates, while a minority consistently had lower or zero rates. There was quantitative variation in the effects when adding choline to suppress commitment, indicating differing responsiveness of parasites to this environmental modification. Performing multiple assay replicates and comparisons of diverse isolates was important to understand this trait and its potential effects on transmission.",

        "abstract": "Many bacteria communicate with kin and coordinate group behaviors through a form of cell-cell signaling called acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing (QS). In these systems, a signal synthase produces an AHL to which its paired receptor selectively responds. Selectivity is fundamental to cell signaling. Despite its importance, it has been challenging to determine how this selectivity is achieved and how AHL QS systems evolve and diversify. We hypothesized that we could use covariation within the protein sequences of AHL synthases and receptors to identify selectivity residues. We began by identifying about 6000 unique synthase-receptor pairs. We then used the protein sequences of these pairs to identify covariation patterns and mapped the patterns onto the LasI/R system from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The covarying residues in both proteins cluster around the ligand-binding sites. We demonstrate that these residues are involved in system selectivity toward the cognate signal and go on to engineer the Las system to both produce and respond to an alternate AHL signal. We have thus demonstrated that covariation methods provide a powerful approach for investigating selectivity in protein-small molecule interactions and have deepened our understanding of how communication systems evolve and diversify.",

Collective learning to a certain degree distinguishes us as a species; it got us out of Africa and the foraging lifestyle of the Palaeolithic, and underpinned demographic cycles and human progress for over 250,000 years. The present article looks at collective learning as a concept, its evolution within hominine species, as well as its role in human demography and the two great revolutions in human history: agriculture and industry. The paper then goes on to explain the connection of collective learning to Jared Diamond's ‘Tasmanian Effect’. Collective learning also played a key role in the two ‘Great Divergences’ of the past two thousand years. One is industry and the rise of the West, described to great effect by Kenneth Pommeranz, the other is the less well known: the burst of demography and innovation in Song China at the turn of the second millennium AD. Finally, the paper concludes with insights into how collective learning forges a strong connection between human history and cosmology, geology, and biology, through what is widely recognized as one of the ‘unifying themes’ of Big History – the rise of complexity in the Universe.",

These peptides can be derived from various sources, including snake venom, marine organisms, cow's milk, seahorses, and plants. Investigating the underlying mechanisms of these peptides in lowering blood pressure is crucial for replacing synthetic drugs currently in use. In this regard, we conducted in silico studies, such as molecular docking, classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and QM/MM simulation methods, on two naturally derived peptides (PAGPRGPA and WALKGYK) and Angiotensin II (ANGII) as the enzyme substrates for binding to sACE. The results of 500 ns MD calculations showed that the WALKGYK peptide occupies the ACE binding site, similar to the ANGII and BPPb peptides, two distinguished C-domain-specific inhibitors. Furthermore, QM/MM calculations demonstrated that no peptide bond cleavage was mediated by Zn2+ at the catalytic site of the peptides. However, during the 500 ns MD simulation, the backbone oxygens of LYS4 and GLY5 of the WALKGYK peptides were tightly coordinated to the Zn2+ ion. Free energy calculations also confirmed the higher affinity of the WALKGYK peptides for binding to sACE. In addition, structural analysis correlation showed a different pattern in PAGPRGPA compared to WALKGYK and ANGII. Despite the similarity of the peptide PAGPRGPA to typical ACE peptide inhibitors with hydrophobic ends, the electrostatic composition of the WALKGYK peptide showed a higher tendency towards ACE inhibition. Therefore, peptide residue compositions, such as WALKGYK, can be considered for designing new inhibitors with fewer side effects for sACE C-terminal inhibitors.",

Though growing evidence suggests that novel variants arise during prolonged infections, most infections are acute. Understanding how efficiently variants emerge and transmit among acutely-infected hosts is therefore critical for predicting the pace of long-term SARS-CoV-2 evolution. To characterize how within-host diversity is generated and propagated, we combine extensive laboratory and bioinformatic controls with metrics of within- and between-host diversity to 133 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from acutely-infected individuals. We find that within-host diversity is low and transmission bottlenecks are narrow, with very few viruses founding most infections. Within-host variants are rarely transmitted, even among individuals within the same household, and are rarely detected along phylogenetically linked infections in the broader community. These findings suggest that most variation generated within-host is lost during transmission.",

Colocalization triggers a conformational change in the switch from an inactive closed state to an active open state with an exposed functional peptide. We prototype the system in yeast and demonstrate that DNA binding triggers activation of the switch, recruitment of a transcription factor, and expression of a downstream reporter gene. This DNA-triggered Co-LOCKR switch provides a platform to engineer sophisticated functions that should only be executed at a specific target site within the genome, with potential applications in a wide range of synthetic systems including epigenetic regulation, imaging, and genetic logic circuits.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the direct interaction of nanostructures per se with biological systems is important for biomedical applications. However, whether nanostructures regulate biological systems by targeting specific cellular proteins remains largely unknown. In the present work, self-assembling nanomicelles are constructed using small-molecule oleanolic acid (OA) as a molecular template. Unexpectedly, without modifications by functional ligands, OA nanomicelles significantly activate cellular proteasome function by directly binding to 20S proteasome subunit alpha 6 (PSMA6). Mechanism study reveals that OA nanomicelles interact with PSMA6 to dynamically modulate its N-terminal domain conformation change, thereby controlling the entry of proteins into 20S proteasome. Subsequently, OA nanomicelles accelerate the degradation of several crucial proteins, thus potently driving cancer cell pyroptosis. For translational medicine, OA nanomicelles exhibit a significant anticancer potential in tumor-bearing mouse models and stimulate immune cell infiltration. Collectively, this proof-of-concept study advances the mechanical understanding of nanostructure-guided biological effects via their inherent capacity to activate proteasome.",

Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.",

        "abstract": "balance continues to be an issue for many people with only three-out-of-ten people (3.4 million) reporting an improvement in the past five years, according to this report. Introduction Former Prime Minister of Australia John Howard described work/life balance as a \"BBQ-stopper\" in 2001. Since then, the term \"work/life balance\" has been part of the Australian lexicon, but just how well are Australians achieving it? National Go Home on Time Day was launched by The Australia Institute in 2009 as a light-hearted way to start a conversation balance with Australian employees (11.6 million people) about the importance of work/life and the many significant consequences it can have on physical and mental health, relationships and communities. Now in its sixth year, Go Home on Time Day continues to promote such conversations, and this paper seeks to measure: have Australians achieved work/life balance? The finding is that work/life balance continues to be an issue for many people with only three-out-of-ten people (3.4 million) reporting an improvement in the past five years. Furthermore, Australians continue to work large amounts of unpaid overtime. Research conducted for Go Home on Time Day this year found that these ‘donated’ hours added up to 58.8 million hours, which based on the average income adds up to almost $110 billion. If these hours were paid and allocated to Australians looking for work the unemployment rate could be zero. In 2010 Australians were on average working 2.5 hours more a week than they would have liked. Only one-in-five workers reported they were working the hours they would like to. Unsurprisingly, the desire for fewer hours was stronger amongst people working long hours, whereas part-time workers indicated they would like to work more hours.1 The general desire for more work by some and less work by others highlights the need to balance the distribution of work hours across the labour force.",

Challenges to the rational design of effective antibodies include the difficulty of achieving specific affinity to critical targets, poor expression, and antibody aggregation caused by buried charges and unstructured loops. To overcome these challenges, we grafted previously determined sequences of fibril-capping amyloid inhibitors onto a camel heavy chain antibody scaffold. These sequences were designed to cap fibrils of tau, known to form the neurofibrillary tangles of AD, thereby preventing fibril elongation. The nanobodies grafted with capping inhibitors blocked tau aggregation in biosensor cells seeded with postmortem brain extracts from AD and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients. The tau capping nanobody inhibitors also blocked seeding by recombinant tau oligomers. Another challenge to the design of effective antibodies is their poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. In this study, we also designed a bispecific nanobody composed of a nanobody that targets a receptor on the BBB and a tau capping nanobody inhibitor, conjoined by a flexible linker. We provide evidence that the bispecific nanobody improved BBB penetration over the tau capping inhibitor alone after intravenous administration in mice. Our results suggest that the design of synthetic antibodies that target sequences that drive protein aggregation may be a promising approach to inhibit the prion-like seeding of tau and other proteins involved in AD and related proteinopathies.",

In this study we set out to develop a transgenic rodent model for testing inhibitors of the Plasmodium falciparum cyclic GMP-dependent kinase in vivo. A model was needed that would allow us to investigate whether differences in amino acid sequence of this enzyme between species influences in vivo efficacy. Here we report the successful development of a transgenic P. berghei line in which the cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) was replaced by the P. falciparum orthologue. We demonstrate that the P. falciparum orthologue was able to functionally complement the endogenous P. berghei pkg gene throughout blood stage development and early sexual development. However, subsequent development in the mosquito was severely compromised. We show that this is due to a defect in the female lineage of the transgenic by using genetic crosses with both male and female deficient P. berghei lines. This defect could be due to expression of a female-specific target in the mosquito stages of P. berghei that cannot be phosphorylated by the P. falciparum kinase. Using a previously reported anti-coccidial inhibitor of the cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase, we show no difference in in vivo efficacy between the transgenic and control P. berghei lines. This in vivo model will be useful for screening future generations of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors and allowing us to overcome any species-specific differences in the enzyme primary sequence that would influence in vivo efficacy in the rodent model. The approach will also be applicable to in vivo testing of other antimalarial compounds where the target is known.",

The latest red version matures more completely, is more tolerant of N-terminal fusions and is over tenfold more photostable than mRFP1.

By incorporating a de novo-designed fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-binding module into these scaffolds, we generated a series of synthetic signaling ligands that exhibit potent valency- and geometry-dependent Ca2+ release and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation. The high specificity of the designed agonists reveals distinct roles for two FGFR splice variants in driving arterial endothelium and perivascular cell fates during early vascular development.

We present a sample of TESS planets and planet candidates that we identify as “best-in-class” for transmission and emission spectroscopy with JWST. These targets are sorted into bins across equilibrium temperature T eq and planetary radius R p and are ranked by a transmission and an emission spectroscopy metric (TSM and ESM, respectively) within each bin. We perform cuts for expected signal size and stellar brightness to remove suboptimal targets for JWST. Of the 194 targets in the resulting sample, 103 are unconfirmed TESS planet candidates, also known as TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs). We perform vetting and statistical validation analyses on these 103 targets to determine which are likely planets and which are likely false positives, incorporating ground-based follow-up from the TESS Follow-up Observation Program to aid the vetting and validation process. We statistically validate 18 TOIs, marginally validate 31 TOIs to varying levels of confidence, deem 29 TOIs likely false positives, and leave the dispositions for four TOIs as inconclusive.

Here, we exploit computational design to specify the size, flexibility, and valency of de novo protein building blocks, as well as the interaction dynamics between them, to investigate how molecular parameters govern the macroscopic viscoelasticity of the resultant protein hydrogels. We construct gel systems from pairs of symmetric protein homo-oligomers, each comprising 2, 5, 24, or 120 individual protein components, that are crosslinked either physically or covalently into idealized step-growth biopolymer networks. Through rheological assessment and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we find that the covalent linkage of multifunctional precursors yields hydrogels whose viscoelasticity depends on the crosslink length between the constituent building blocks. In contrast, reversibly crosslinking the homo-oligomeric components with a computationally designed heterodimer results in non-Newtonian biomaterials exhibiting fluid-like properties under rest and low shear, but shear-stiffening solid-like behavior at higher frequencies. Exploiting the unique genetic encodability of these materials, we demonstrate the assembly of protein networks within living mammalian cells and show via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) that mechanical properties can be tuned intracellularly, in correlation with matching formulations formed extracellularly.

Emerging capabilities in high-speed atomic force microscopy and machine learning have allowed us to directly determine the orientational energy landscape and observe and quantify the rotational dynamics for protein nanorods on the surface of muscovite mica under a variety of conditions. Comparisons with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations show that the transition rates between adjacent orientation-specific energetic minima can largely be understood through traditional models of in-plane Brownian rotation across a biased energy landscape, with resulting transition rates that are exponential in the energy barriers between states. However, transitions between more distant angular states are decoupled from barrier height, with jump-size distributions showing a power law decay that is characteristic of a nonclassical Levy-flight random walk, indicating that large jumps are enabled by alternative modes of motion via activated states. The findings provide insights into the dynamics of biomolecules at solid–liquid interfaces that lead to self-assembly, epitaxial matching, and other orientationally anisotropic outcomes and define a general procedure for exploring such dynamics with implications for hybrid biomolecular–inorganic materials design.",

Despite current multidisciplinary treatments, there has not been a drastic change in overall prognosis within the last two decades. With current treatments, 60-70 % of patients with localized disease survive. Given a propensity of Wnt signaling to control multiple cellular processes, including proliferation, cell fate determination, and differentiation, it is a critical pathway in OS disease progression. At the same time, this pathway is extremely complex with vast arrays of cross-talk. Even though decades of research have linked the role of Wnt to tumorigenesis, there are still outstanding areas that remain poorly understood and even controversial. The canonical Wnt pathway functions to regulate the levels of the transcriptional co-activator β-catenin, which ultimately controls key developmental gene expressions. Given the central role of this mediator, inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been investigated as a potential strategy for cancer control. In OS, several secreted protein families modulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, including secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs), Wnt inhibitory protein (WIF), Dickkopf proteins (DKK-1,2,3), sclerostin, and small molecules. This chapter focuses on our current understanding of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in OS, based on recent in vitro and in vivo data. Wnt activates noncanonical signaling pathways as well that are independent of β-catenin which will be discussed. In addition, stem cells and their association with Wnt/β-catenin are important factors to consider. Ultimately, the multiple canonical and noncanonical Wnt/β-catenin agonists and antagonists need to be further explored for potential targeted therapies.",

The process involves fermentation stages, giving the characteristic organoleptic properties of the product that is produced largely at a small-scale household level and sold as a street food. Like many other indigenous foods, quality control is problematic and depends on the skills of the processor. In order to improve the quality of the product and standardize the process for large-scale production, we need a deeper understanding of the microbial processes. The aim of this study is to investigate the microbial community involved in the production of this traditional millet porridge and the metabolites produced during processing. High-throughput amplicon sequencing was used to identify the bacterial (16S rRNA V4 hypervariable region) and fungal [Intergenic Transcribed Spacer (ITS)] communities associated with the fermentation, while nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used for metabolite profiling. The bacterial community diversity was reduced during the fermentation processes with an increase and predominance of lactobacilli. Other dominant bacteria in the fermentation included Pediococcus, Weissella, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Leuconostoc, and Acetobacter. The species Limosilactobacillus fermentum and Ligilactobacillus salivarius accounted for some of the diversities within and between fermentation time points and processors. The fungal community was dominated by the genus Saccharomyces. Other genera such as Pichia, Candida, Kluyveromyces, Nakaseomyces, Torulaspora, and Cyberlindnera were also classified. The species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Stachybotrys sansevieriae, Malassezia restricta, Cyberlindnera fabianii, and Kluyveromyces marxianus accounted for some of the diversities within some fermentation time points. The species S. sansevieria and M. restricta may have been reported for the first time in cereal fermentation. This is the most diverse microbial community reported in Hausa koko. In this study, we could identify and quantify 33 key different metabolites produced by the interactions of the microbial communities with the millet, composed of organic compounds, sugars, amino acids and intermediary compounds, and other key fermentation compounds. An increase in the concentration of organic acids in parallel with the reduction of sugars occurred during the fermentation process while an initial increase of amino acids followed by a decrease in later fermentation steps was observed.",

However, engineering dynamic phenomena such as oscillations in protein-level circuits remains an outstanding challenge. Few examples of biological posttranslational oscillators are known, necessitating theoretical progress to determine realizable oscillators. We construct mathematical models for two posttranslational oscillators, using few components that interact only through reversible binding and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions. Our designed oscillators rely on the self-assembly of two protein species into multimeric functional enzymes that respectively inhibit and enhance this self-assembly. We limit our analysis to within experimental constraints, finding (i) significant portions of the restricted parameter space yielding oscillations and (ii) that oscillation periods can be tuned by several orders of magnitude using recent advances in computational protein design. Our work paves the way for the rational design and realization of protein-based dynamic systems.",

Gallium and its alloys are attractive for applications in high power pulsed energy systems due to a high figure of merit compared to other LMPMs as well as a transition temperature near ambient. However, considerations need to be made for gallium compatibility with common electronics packaging metals to avoid compromising thermal and phase change properties. The experimental presented evaluates gold, copper, nickel, platinum, and aluminum compatibility with liquid gallium. The study addresses concern that metals in packaging will migrate into the gallium, effecting its thermal properties.To evaluate the effects of any interdiffusion or intermetallic formation a Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) was used to develop heating and cooling curves for gallium packaged with each of the materials. These test packages consist of DSC crucibles with metal thin-films deposited in material stacks typical of electronic microfabrication and packaging. Gallium is introduced to each crucible and ramped through the heating curve three times. Experimental results evaluate the thermal effects of any compatibility concerns with the selected materials. Samples are further analyzed with X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) to determine nickel and platinum suitability as a diffusion barrier and gallium penetration of the thin film stacks. These results will be used to further the investigation of direct-application of LMPMs to electronics for thermal management.",

Although designed proteins often exhibit binding of the desired ligand, in some cases they display unintended recognition behavior. One such designed protein, that was originally intended to bind tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), was found instead to display binding of 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol (25-D3) and was subjected to biochemical characterization, further selections for enhanced 25-D3 binding affinity and crystallographic analyses. The deviation in specificity is due in part to unexpected altertion of its conformation, corresponding to a significant change of the orientation of an α-helix and an equally large movement of a loop, both of which flank the designed ligand-binding pocket. Those changes led to engineered protein constructs that exhibit significantly more contacts and complementarity towards the 25-D3 ligand than the initial designed protein had been predicted to form towards its intended THC ligand. Molecular dynamics simulations imply that the initial computationally designed mutations may contribute to the movement of the helix. These analyses collectively indicate that accurate prediction and control of backbone dynamics conformation, through a combination of improved conformational sampling and/or de novo structure design, represents a key area of further development for the design and optimization of engineered ligand-binding proteins.",

Research to determine the dependence of deformation on the humidity of the surrounding structural materials of the cathedrals was carried out by a holographic interferometer. Diagrams of humidity and temperature deformation show the following results: the graphics of humidity and temperature are alike, the temperature deformations are not extensive, deformation due to humidity is more serious than deformation caused by temperature. The investigations of temperature and humidity deformation made it possible to give recommendations for the level of indoor air temperature and humidity in cathedrals.

Initial rationale for addition of 2-ethoxyethanol was to minimize inhibitory effects of decalin on filtration and to facilitate starch solubilization. Decalin is no longer recommended in the procedure; alpha-amylase is commonly used to facilitate starch solubilization. Objectives of this study were to evaluate effects on NDF values of: 1) eliminating 2-ethoxyethanol from the procedure and 2) addition of and timing of addition of alpha-amylase. Deletion of 2-ethoxyethanol resulted in lower NDF values than neutral detergent solution with 2-ethoxyethanol (61.95 and 62.06%, respectively). Neutral detergent fiber values were lower for samples treated with alpha-amylase just prior to filtration (61.86%) than for samples not treated with alpha-amylase (62.13%). Addition of alpha-amylase 30 min after onset of boiling resulted in lower values (62.07%) than with no alpha-amylase addition (62.29%) in solutions containing 2-ethoxyethanol but not in solutions without 2-ethoxyethanol. Observed treatment differences were small, however, and probably not of practical significance. No differences in NDF values were noted due to timing of alpha-amylase addition. Inclusion of samples requiring alpha-amylase to filter increased overall mean CV and resulted in no statistical differences between neutral detergent solutions or alpha-amylase treatments. Suggested modifications to the NDF procedure include elimination of 2-ethoxyethanol and addition of alpha-amylase just prior to filtering.",

Procedures are exemplified by QTL-associated SNPs in hexaploid wheat. Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers are commonly used in marker-assisted commercial plant breeding due to their cost-effectiveness and throughput for high sample volumes. However, conversion of trait-linked SNP markers from array-based SNP detection technologies into KASP markers is particularly challenging in polyploid crop species, due to the presence of highly similar homeologous and paralogous genome sequences. We evaluated strategies and identified key requirements for successful conversion of Illumina Infinium assays from the wheat 90 K SNP array into robust locus-specific KASP markers. Numerous examples showed that commonly used software for semiautomated KASP primer design frequently fails to achieve locus-specificity of KASP assays in wheat. Instead, alignment of SNP probes with multiple reference genomes and Sanger sequencing of relevant genotypes, followed by visual KASP primer placement, was critical for locus-specificity. To identify KASP assays resulting in false calling of heterozygous individuals, validation of KASP assays using extended reference genotype sets including heterozygous genotypes is strongly advised for polyploid crop species. Applying this strategy, we developed highly reproducible, stable KASP assays that are predictive for root biomass QTL haplotypes from highly homoeologous wheat chromosome regions. Due to their locus-specificity, these assays predicted root biomass considerably better than the original trait-associated markers from the Illumina array.",

The radiation dose to man through the marine food chain following the loss of undamaged and fire-damaged packages to the continental shelf and in the deep ocean are conservatively estimated. Two failure mechanisms that could lead to release of radioactive material after loss of packages into the ocean have been considered: corrosion and hydrostatic pressure. A third possible mechanism is thermal overpressurization following burial in marine sediments. It was determined that the seals or pressure relief devices on an undamaged spent fuel cask might fail from hydrostatic forces for losses on the continental shelf although some cask designs would retain their integrity at this depth. The population dose to man through the marine food chain following these scenarios has been estimated. The dose estimates are made relating the radioactive material released and the seafood productivity in the region of the release. Doses are based on a one-year consumption of contaminated seafood. The loss of a single plutonium package on the continental shelf is estimated to produce a population dose commitmentmore » of less than 250 man-rem for recycle plutonium.

There has been considerable interest in designing allosteric systems, both to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying such 'action at a distance' modulation and to create synthetic proteins whose functions can be regulated by effectors4-7. However, emulating the subtle conformational changes distributed across many residues, characteristic of natural allosteric proteins, is a significant challenge8,9. Here, inspired by the classic Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of cooperativity10, we investigate the de novo design of allostery through rigid-body coupling of peptide-switchable hinge modules11 to protein interfaces12 that direct the formation of alternative oligomeric states. We find that this approach can be used to generate a wide variety of allosterically switchable systems, including cyclic rings that incorporate or eject subunits in response to peptide binding and dihedral cages that undergo effector-induced disassembly. Size-exclusion chromatography, mass photometry13 and electron microscopy reveal that these designed allosteric protein assemblies closely resemble the design models in both the presence and absence of peptide effectors and can have ligand-binding cooperativity comparable to classic natural systems such as haemoglobin14. Our results indicate that allostery can arise from global coupling of the energetics of protein substructures without optimized side-chain-side-chain allosteric communication pathways and provide a roadmap for generating allosterically triggerable delivery systems, protein nanomachines and cellular feedback control circuitry.",

Towards this goal, we use de novo protein design, molecular dynamic simulations, and cell-free systems to explore how membrane-protein hydrophobic mismatch could be used to tune protein cotranslational integration and organization in synthetic lipid membranes. We find that membranes must deform to accommodate membrane-protein hydrophobic mismatch, which reduces the expression and co-translational insertion of membrane proteins into synthetic membranes. We use this principle to sort proteins both between and within membranes, thereby achieving one-pot assembly of vesicles with distinct functions and controlled split-protein assembly, respectively.

We employ deep learning generated psuedocycles with repeating structural units surrounding central pockets; depending on the geometry of the structural unit and repeat number, these pockets span wide ranges of sizes and shapes. For a small molecule target of interest, we extensively sample high shape complementarity pseudocycles to generate large numbers of customized potential binding pockets; the ligand binding poses and the interacting interfaces are then optimized for high affinity binding. We computationally design binders to four diverse molecules, including for the first time polar flexible molecules such as methotrexate and thyroxine, which are expressed at high levels and have nanomolar affinities straight out of the computer. Co-crystal structures are nearly identical to the design models. Taking advantage of the modular repeating structure of pseudocycles and central location of the binding pockets, we constructed low noise nanopore sensors and chemically induced dimerization systems by splitting the binders into domains which assemble into the original pseudocycle pocket upon target molecule addition.",

Herein, we illustrate the importance of dynamics in modulating the function of C34, a designed α/β protein that captures β-strands of target ligands and is a member of a family of proteins designed to sequester β-strands and β hairpins of aggregation-prone molecules that lead to a variety of pathologies. Using a strategy to \"see\" regions of apo C34 that are invisible to NMR spectroscopy as a result of pervasive conformational exchange, as well as a mutagenesis approach whereby C34 molecules are stabilized into a single conformer, we determine the structures of the predominant conformations that are sampled by C34 and show that these attenuate the affinity for cognate peptide. Subsequently, the observed motion is exploited to develop an allosterically regulated peptide binder whose binding affinity can be controlled through the addition of a second molecule. Our study emphasizes the unique role that NMR can play in directing the design process and in the construction of new molecules with more complex functionality.",

        "abstract": "Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse results in an upregulation of cAMP signaling in the mesolimbic dopamine system, a molecular adaptation thought to be critically involved in the development of drug dependence. Exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac2) is a major cAMP effector abundantly expressed in the brain. However, it remains unknown whether Epac2 contributes to cocaine reinforcement. Here, we report that Epac2 in the mesolimbic dopamine system promotes cocaine reinforcement via enhancement of dopamine release. Conditional knockout of Epac2 from midbrain dopamine neurons (Epac2-cKO) and the selective Epac2 inhibitor ESI-05 decreased cocaine self-administration in mice under both fixed-ratio and progressive-ratio reinforcement schedules and across a broad range of cocaine doses. In addition, Epac2-cKO led to reduced evoked dopamine release, whereas Epac2 agonism robustly enhanced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in vitro. This mechanism is central to the behavioral effects of Epac2 disruption, as chemogenetic stimulation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons via deschloroclozapine (DCZ)-induced activation of Gs-DREADD increased dopamine release and reversed the impairment of cocaine self-administration in Epac2-cKO mice. Conversely, chemogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons with Gi-DREADD reduced dopamine release and cocaine self-administration in wild-type mice. Epac2-mediated enhancement of dopamine release may therefore represent a novel and powerful mechanism that contributes to cocaine reinforcement.",

        "abstract": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) exerts pleiotropic effects on ventromedial nuclei (VMN) of the hypothalamus and its control of feeding and energy expenditure through the type I PAC1 receptor (PAC1R). However, the endogenous role of PAC1Rs in the VMN and the downstream signaling responsible for PACAP's effects on energy balance are unknown. Numerous studies have revealed that PAC1Rs are coupled to both Gαs/adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (Gαs/AC/PKA) and Gαq/phospholipase C/protein kinase C (Gαq/PLC/PKC), while also undergoing trafficking following stimulation. To determine the endogenous role of PAC1Rs and downstream signaling that may explain PACAP's pleiotropic effects, we used RNA interference to knockdown VMN PAC1Rs and pharmacologically inhibited PKA, PKC, and PAC1R trafficking. Knocking down PAC1Rs increased meal sizes, reduced total number of meals, and induced body weight gain. Inhibition of either PKA or PKC alone in awake male Sprague-Dawley rats, attenuated PACAP's hypophagic and anorectic effects during the dark phase. However, PKA or PKC inhibition potentiated PACAP's thermogenic effects during the light phase. Analysis of locomotor activity revealed that PKA inhibition augmented PACAP's locomotor effects, whereas PKC inhibition had no effect. Finally, PACAP administration in the VMN induces surface PAC1R trafficking into the cytosol which was blocked by endocytosis inhibitors. Subsequently, inhibition of PAC1R trafficking into the cytosol attenuated PACAP-induced hypophagia. These results revealed that endogenous PAC1Rs uniquely engage PKA, PKC, and receptor trafficking to mediate PACAP's pleiotropic effects in VMN control of feeding and metabolism.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Endogenous PAC1 receptors, integral to VMN management of feeding behavior and body weight regulation, uniquely engage PKA, PKC, and receptor trafficking to mediate the hypothalamic ventromedial nuclei control of feeding and metabolism.

Due to their structural regularity and simplicity, a wide range of monomeric repeat proteins and oligomeric helical bundle structures have been designed and characterized. Here we describe a stepwise hierarchical approach to building up multi-component symmetric protein assemblies using these structures. We first connect designed helical repeat proteins (DHRs) to designed helical bundle proteins (HBs) to generate a large library of heterodimeric and homooligomeric building blocks; the latter have cyclic symmetries ranging from C2 to C6. All of the building blocks have repeat proteins with accessible termini, which we take advantage of in a second round of architecture guided rigid helical fusion (WORMS) to generate larger symmetric assemblies including C3 and C5 cyclic and D2 dihedral rings, a tetrahedral cage, and a 120 subunit icosahedral cage. Characterization of the structures by small angle x-ray scattering, x-ray crystallography, and cryo-electron microscopy demonstrates that the hierarchical design approach can accurately and robustly generate a wide range of macromolecular assemblies; with a diameter of 43nm, the icosahedral nanocage is the largest structurally validated designed cage to date.

This is true for workers across the earning spectrum. A well-functioning labour market would be expected to produce a closer match between the hours worked and workers’ desired hours. But many Australian workers indicate their difficulty in negotiating more flexible, predictable or suitable hours with their employers. It is clear that relieving the impact on individuals, families and communities of inflexible hours of work starts with communication – not only do Australians work long hours, but around one in five Australians also work unpredictable hours, with around 2.2 million Australians reporting that they have little or no idea what time they will finish work that day. Furthermore, a large number of Australians report that they do not feel secure about their work. That is, around 20 per cent of the workforce, more than two million people, feel uncertain about the security of their tenure, the security of their work hours, or both. The combined impact of dissatisfaction with the length of working hours, the unpredictability of working hours and the uncertainty about job security combine to cause around half of all Australians to express dissatisfaction with their hours of work, with around a quarter wishing they worked more and a quarter wanting to work less.",

However, no vaccine is currently available to protect this vulnerable population. Palivizumab, the only approved agent for RSV prophylaxis, is limited to high-risk infants, and the cost associated with the requirement for dosing throughout the RSV season makes its use impractical for all infants. We describe the development of a monoclonal antibody as potential RSV prophylaxis for all infants with a single intramuscular dose. MEDI8897*, a highly potent human antibody, was optimized from antibody D25, which targets the prefusion conformation of the RSV fusion (F) protein. Crystallographic analysis of Fab in complex with RSV F from subtypes A and B reveals that MEDI8897* binds a highly conserved epitope. MEDI8897* neutralizes a diverse panel of RSV A and B strains with >50-fold higher activity than palivizumab. At similar serum concentrations, prophylactic administration of MEDI8897* was ninefold more potent than palivizumab at reducing pulmonary viral loads by >3 logs in cotton rats infected with either RSV A or B subtypes. MEDI8897 was generated by the introduction of triple amino acid substitutions (YTE) into the Fc domain of MEDI8897*, which led to more than threefold increased half-life in cynomolgus monkeys compared to non-YTE antibody. Considering the pharmacokinetics of palivizumab in infants, which necessitates five monthly doses for protection during an RSV season, the high potency and extended half-life of MEDI8897 support its development as a cost-effective option to protect all infants from RSV disease with once-per-RSV-season dosing in the clinic.",

Here we describe a solution to this problem that generates structured loops buttressed by extensive hydrogen bonding interactions with two neighboring loops and with secondary structure elements. We use this approach to design tandem repeat proteins with buttressed loops ranging from 9 to 14 residues in length. Experimental characterization shows the designs are folded and monodisperse, highly soluble, and thermally stable. Crystal structures are in close agreement with the computational design models, with the loops structured and buttressed by their neighbors as designed. We demonstrate the functionality afforded by loop buttressing by designing and characterizing binders for extended peptides in which the loops form one side of an extended binding pocket. The ability to design multiple structured loops should contribute quite generally to efforts to design new protein functions.",

        "abstract": "All tissue development and replenishment relies upon the breaking of symmetries leading to the morphological and operational differentiation of progenitor cells into more specialized cells. One of the main engines driving this process is the Notch signal transduction pathway, a ubiquitous signalling system found in the vast majority of metazoan cell types characterized to date. Broadly speaking, Notch receptor activity is governed by a balance between two processes: 1) intercellular Notch transactivation triggered via interactions between receptors and ligands expressed in neighbouring cells; 2) intracellular cis inhibition caused by ligands binding to receptors within the same cell. Additionally, recent reports have also unveiled evidence of cis activation. Whilst context-dependent Notch receptor clustering has been hypothesized, to date, Notch signalling has been assumed to involve an interplay between receptor and ligand monomers. In this study, we demonstrate biochemically, through a mutational analysis of DLL4, both in vitro and in tissue culture cells, that Notch ligands can efficiently self-associate. We found that the membrane proximal EGF-like repeat of DLL4 was necessary and sufficient to promote oligomerization/dimerization. Mechanistically, our experimental evidence supports the view that DLL4 ligand dimerization is specifically required for cis-inhibition of Notch receptor activity. To further substantiate these findings, we have adapted and extended existing ordinary differential equation-based models of Notch signalling to take account of the ligand dimerization-dependent cis-inhibition reported here. Our new model faithfully recapitulates our experimental data and improves predictions based upon published data. Collectively, our work favours a model in which net output following Notch receptor/ligand binding results from ligand monomer-driven Notch receptor transactivation (and cis activation) counterposed by ligand dimer-mediated cis-inhibition.",

        "abstract": "As a result of evolutionary selection, the subunits of naturally occurring protein assemblies often fit together with substantial shape complementarity to generate architectures optimal for function in a manner not achievable by current design approaches. We describe a \"top-down\" reinforcement learning-based design approach that solves this problem using Monte Carlo tree search to sample protein conformers in the context of an overall architecture and specified functional constraints. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the designed disk-shaped nanopores and ultracompact icosahedra are very close to the computational models. The icosohedra enable very-high-density display of immunogens and signaling molecules, which potentiates vaccine response and angiogenesis induction. Our approach enables the top-down design of complex protein nanomaterials with desired system properties and demonstrates the power of reinforcement learning in protein design.",

        "abstract": "In model organisms, type IV ATPases (P4-ATPases) require cell division control protein 50 (CDC50) chaperones for their phospholipid flipping activity. In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, guanylyl cyclase alpha (GCα) is an integral membrane protein that is essential for release (egress) of merozoites from their host erythrocytes. GCα is unusual in that it contains both a C-terminal cyclase domain and an N-terminal P4-ATPase domain of unknown function. We sought to investigate whether any of the three CDC50 orthologues (termed A, B, and C) encoded by P. falciparum are required for GCα function. Using gene tagging and conditional gene disruption, we demonstrate that CDC50B and CDC50C but not CDC50A are expressed in the clinically important asexual blood stages and that CDC50B is a binding partner of GCα whereas CDC50C is the binding partner of another putative P4-ATPase, phospholipid-transporting ATPase 2 (ATP2). Our findings indicate that CDC50B has no essential role for intraerythrocytic parasite maturation but modulates the rate of parasite egress by interacting with GCα for optimal cGMP synthesis. In contrast, CDC50C is essential for blood stage trophozoite maturation. Additionally, we find that the CDC50C-ATP2 complex may influence parasite endocytosis of host cell hemoglobin and consequently hemozoin formation. IMPORTANCE Malaria morbidity arises due to successive rounds of replication of Plasmodium parasites within red blood cells. Mature daughter merozoites are released from infected erythrocytes to invade new cells in a tightly regulated process termed egress. Previous studies have shown that a unique bifunctional guanylyl cyclase, GCα, initiates egress by synthesis of cGMP. GCα has an N-terminal P4-ATPase domain of unknown function. In model organisms, P4-ATPases function through interaction with a CDC50 partner protein. Here, we investigate the role of CDC50 orthologues in P. falciparum and show that GCα binds CDC50B, an interaction that regulates egress efficiency. We also find that CDC50C is essential and binds a putative P4-ATPase, ATP2, in a complex that influences endocytosis of host hemaglobin. Our results highlight the heterogenous and critical role of CDC50 proteins in P. falciparum.",

Here, we performed gene-level collapsing analysis on exome sequences from 454,796 multi-ancestry UK Biobank participants to detect genetic associations with diabetes. Rare nonsynonymous variations in GCK, GIGYF1, HNF1A, and HNF4A were significantly associated (P<1x10-8) with increased risk of diabetes, whereas rare nonsynonymous variations in MAP3K15 were significantly associated with reduced risk of diabetes. Recessive carriers of rare non-synonymous variants in the X chromosome gene MAP3K15 had a 30% reduced risk of diabetes (OR=0.70, 95% CI: [0.62,0.79], P=5.7x10-10), along with reduced blood glucose (beta=-0.13, 95% CI: [-0.15,-0.10], P=5.5x10-18) and reduced glycosylated haemoglobin levels (beta=-0.14, 95% CI: [-0.16,-0.11], P=1.1x10-24). Hemizygous males carrying protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in MAP3K15 demonstrated a 40% reduced risk of diabetes (OR=0.60, 95% CI: [0.45,0.81], P=0.0007). These findings were independently replicated in FinnGen, with a MAP3K15 PTV associating with decreased risk of both type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (p<0.05). The effect of MAP3K15 loss on diabetes was independent of body mass index, suggesting its protective effect is unlikely to be mediated via the insulin resistance pathway. Tissue expression profile of MAP3K15 indicates a possible involvement of pancreatic islet cell or stress response pathways. No safety concerns were identified among heterozygous or recessive MAP3K15 PTV carriers across over 15,719 studied endpoints in the UK Biobank.

Using machine learning and automated image processing, we analyze scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images to study how the attachment density and alignment fidelity are influenced by variables such as the aspect ratio of the Au nanorods, and the salt concentration of the solution. We find that the Au nanorods prefer to align parallel to the protein nanofibers. This preference decreases with increasing salt concentration, but is only weakly sensitive to the nanorod aspect ratio. While the overall specific Au nanorod attachment density to the protein fibers increases with increasing solution ionic strength, this increase is dominated primarily by non-specific binding to the substrate background, and we find that greater specific attachment (nanorods attached to the nanofiber template as compared to the substrates) occurs at the lower studied salt concentrations, with the maximum ratio of specific to non-specific binding occurring when the protein fiber solutions are prepared in 75 mM NaCl concentration.",

We applied a cryoEM-based method for high-resolution mapping of polyclonal antibody responses elicited in immunized animals (cryoEMPEM). Mutational analysis coupled with neutralization assays were used to probe the neutralization potential at each epitope. We demonstrate that cryoEMPEM data can be used for rapid, high-resolution analysis of polyclonal antibody responses without the need for monoclonal antibody isolation. This approach allowed to resolve structurally distinct classes of antibodies that bind overlapping sites.

        "abstract": "Naturally occurring allosteric protein switches have been repurposed for developing novel biosensors and reporters for cellular and clinical applications 1 , but the number of such switches is limited, and engineering them is often challenging as each is different. Here, we show that a very general class of allosteric protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest 2 . Using broadly applicable design principles, we allosterically couple binding of protein analytes of interest to the reconstitution of luciferase activity and a bioluminescent readout through the association of designed lock and key proteins. Because the sensor is based purely on thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to switch activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We demonstrate the modularity of this platform by creating biosensors that, with little optimization, sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2, the hIgG1 Fc domain, the Her2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac Troponin I and an anti-Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibody that achieve the sub-nanomolar sensitivity necessary to detect clinically relevant concentrations of these molecules. Given the current need for diagnostic tools for tracking COVID-19 3 , we use the approach to design sensors of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 protein epitopes and of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The latter, which incorporates a de novo designed RBD binder, has a limit of detection of 15pM with an up to seventeen fold increase in luminescence upon addition of RBD. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.",

        "title": "Against the grain: a deep history of the earliest states",
        "abstract": "ens have existed for at least 200,000 years. Life was simple at first. Then, about 10,000 years ago, our ancestors began to switch from hunting and gathering to farming. Jared Diamond in 1987 famously called agriculture “the worst mistake in the history of the human race” because it brought “the gross social and sexual inequality, the disease and despotism, that curse our existence.” Mark Cohen and George Armelagos wrote in 2013 (p. xxx) that Diamond’s essay “is the latest in a long list of those that criticize the transformation to agriculture.” The list is now longer, and includes a recent book written by political scientist James C. Scott. Scott condenses the best of this literature, explores the implications for formation of states, then argues that emergence of states made the health and lives of non-elite masses even worse. The surveyed literature, including a book by Richard Manning, the title of which Scott (p. xv) confesses to have poached, focuses on nutritional stress (from the replacement of a varied diet with a few starchy foods), physical stress (from hard farm labor), and infectious disease (spread in concentrated human and animal populations). By 1982, paleopathologists had unearthed sufficient evidence to produce a consensus that agriculture caused human life expectancy and health to deteriorate for all but a small elite. Fertility increased sharply, however. This more than offset increased mortality, so the population slowly grew, accelerating eventually in a “demographic explosion of agricultural peoples at the expense of hunters and gatherers” (p. 83). Looking at the history of early states, Scott finds the the type of crop grown by farmers to be extremely important. The “first small, stratified, tax-collecting, walled states,” he writes, “pop up in the Tigris and Euphrates Valley only around 3,100 BCE, more than four millenia after the first crop domestications and sedentism” (p. 7). Grain (wheat, barley, rice, or maize) was essential because it can be stored, rationed, and taxed. This is why “virtually all classical states were based on grain, including millets. History records no cassava states, no sago, yam, taro, plaintain, breadfruit or sweet potato states” (p. 21). Ancient history was written by elites, not by the illiterate masses, so it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to determine the independent effect that states may have had on the quality of life of the masses. One commonly used measure of success is population size. Scott mentions (p. 96) that world population “according to one careful estimate” was about 4 million in 10,000 BCE, 5 million in 5,000 BCE, increasing to “more than 100million” by 1 CE. He does not cite his source, but the two BCE figures are identical to those of McEvedy and Jones (pp. 343–344), who add that population growth accelerated after 5,000 BCE, with world population reaching 100 million in 500 BCE, 150 million by the 2nd century BCE, and 200 million by the 2nd century CE. They attribute population growth to development of agriculture, but this growth coincides with, so could also be attributed to, development of early states. Scott barely mentions population growth, other than noting that it",

        "title": "Sequencing smart: De novo sequencing and assembly approaches for non-model mammals, bioRxiv, 723890",
        "abstract": "d Whilst much sequencing effort has focused on key mammalian model organisms such as mouse and human, little is known about the correlation between genome sequencing techniques for non-model mammals and genome assembly quality. This is especially relevant to non-model mammals, where the samples to be sequenced are often degraded and low quality. A key aspect when planning a genome project is the choice of sequencing data to generate. This decision is driven by several factors, including the biological questions being asked, the quality of DNA available, and the availability of funds. Cutting-edge sequencing technologies now make it possible to achieve highly contiguous, chromosome-level genome assemblies, but relies on good quality high-molecular-weight DNA. The funds to generate and combining these data are often only available within large consortiums and sequencing initiatives, and are often not affordable for many independent research groups. For many researchers, value-for-money is a key factor when considering the generation of genomic sequencing data. Here we use a range of different genomic technologies generated from a roadkill European Polecat (Mustela putorius) to assess various assembly techniques on this low-quality sample. We evaluated different approaches for de novo assemblies and discuss their value in relation to biological analyses. Results Generally, assemblies containing more data types achieved better scores in our ranking system. However, when accounting for misassemblies, this was not always the case for Bionano and low-coverage 10x Genomics (for scaffolding only). We also find that the extra cost associated with combining multiple data types is not necessarily associated with better genome assemblies. Conclusions The high degree of variability between each de novo assembly method (assessed from the seven key metrics) highlights the importance of carefully devising the sequencing strategy to be able to carry out the desired analysis. Adding more data to genome assemblies not always results in better assemblies so it is important to understand the nuances of genomic data integration explained here, in order to obtain cost-effective value-for-money when sequencing genomes.",

        "title": "Leading libraries: Leading in uncertain times: A literature review",
        "abstract": "Objective: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are complex chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract with uncertain etiology. IBDs comprise two idiopathic disorders: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The aetiology, severity and progression of such disorders are still poorly understood but thought to be influenced by multiple factors (including genetic, environmental, immunological, physiological, psychological factors and gut microbiome) and their interactions. The overarching aim of this review is to evaluate the extent and nature of the interrelationship between these factors with the disease course. A broader conceptual and longitudinal framework of possible neuro-visceral integration, core microbiome analysis and immune modulation assessment may be useful in accurately documenting and characterizing the nature and temporal continuity of crosstalk between these factors and the role of their interaction (s) in IBD disease activity. Characterization of these interactions holds the promise of identifying novel diagnostic, interventions, and therapeutic strategies. Material and Methods: A search of published literature was conducted by exploring PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Medline Plus, CDSR library databases. Following search terms relating to key question were set for the search included: \"Inflammatory bowel diseases,\" \"gut microbiota,\" \"psychological distress and IBD,\" \"autonomic reactivity and IBD,\" \"immune modulation,\" \"chronic inflammation,\" \"gut inflammation,\" \"enteric nervous system,\" \"gut nervous system,\" \"Crohn's disease,\" \"Ulcerative colitis\", \"depression and IBD\", \"anxiety and IBD\", \"quality of life in IBD patients,\" \"relapse in IBDs,\" \"remission in IBDs,\" \"IBD disease activity,\" \"brain-gut-axis,\" \"microbial signature in IBD,\" \"validated questionnaires in IBD,\" \"IBD activity indices,\" \"IBD aetiology,\" \"IBDs and stress,\" \"epidemiology of IBDs\", \"autonomic nervous system and gut inflammation\", \"IBD and environment,\" \"genetics of IBDs,\" \"pathways of immune response in IBDs,\" \"sleep disturbances in IBD,\" \"hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA),\" \"sympatho-adrenal axis,\" \"CNS and its control of gut function\" \"mucosal immune response,\" \"commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the gut,\" \"innate and adaptive immunity.\" Studies evaluating any possible associations between gut microbiome, psychological state, immune modulation, and autonomic function with IBDs were identified. Commonly cited published literatures with high quality research methodology/results and additional articles from bibliographies of recovered papers were examined and included where relevant. Results: Although there is a substantial literature identifying major contributing factors with IBD, there has been little attempt to integrate some factors over time and assess their interplay and relationship with IBD disease activity. Such contributing factors include genetic and environmental factors, gut microbiota composition and function, physiological factors, psychological state and gut immune response. Interdependences are evident across psychological and biological factors and IBD disease activity. Although from the available evidence, it is implausible that a single explanatory model could elucidate the interplay between such factors and the disease course as well as the sequence of the effect during the pathophysiology of IBD. Conclusion: Longitudinal monitoring of IBD patients and integrating data related to the contributing/risk factors including psychological state, physiological conditions, inflammatory/immune modulations, and microbiome composition/function, could help to explain how major factors associate and interrelate leading to exacerbation of symptoms and disease activity. Identifying the temporal trajectory of biological and psychosocial disturbances may also help to assess their effects and interdependence on individuals' disease status. Moreover, this allows greater insight into understanding the temporal progressions of subclinical events as potential ground for disease severity in IBD. Furthermore, understanding the interaction between these risk factors may help better interventions in controlling the disease, reducing the costs related to disease management, further implications for clinical practice and research approaches in addition to improving patients' mental health and quality of life.",

Besides its well-known advantages over parenteral nutrition, PEG offers superior access to the gastrointestinal system over surgical methods. Considering that nowadays PEG tube placement is one of the most common endoscopic procedures performed worldwide, knowing its indications and contraindications is of paramount importance in current medicine. PEG tubes are sometimes placed inappropriately in patients unable to tolerate adequate oral intake because of incorrect and unrealistic understanding of their indications and what they can accomplish. Broadly, the two main indications of PEG tube placement are enteral feeding and stomach decompression. On the other hand, distal enteral obstruction, severe uncorrectable coagulopathy and hemodynamic instability constitute the main absolute contraindications for PEG tube placement in hospitalized patients. Although generally considered to be a safe procedure, there is the potential for both minor and major complications. Awareness of these potential complications, as well as understanding routine aftercare of the catheter, can improve the quality of care for patients with a PEG tube. These complications can generally be classified into three major categories: endoscopic technical difficulties, PEG procedure-related complications and late complications associated with PEG tube use and wound care. In this review we describe a variety of minor and major tube-related complications as well as strategies for their management and avoidance. Different methods of percutaneous PEG tube placement into the stomach have been described in the literature with the \"pull\" technique being the most common method. In the last section of this review, the reader is presented with a brief discussion of these procedures, techniques and related issues. Despite the mentioned PEG tube placement complications, this procedure has gained worldwide popularity as a safe enteral access for nutrition in patients with a functional gastrointestinal system.",

Spo0A functions by both activating and repressing transcription initiation from target promoters that contain 0A boxes, the binding sites for Spo0A. Several classes of spo0A mutants have been isolated, and the molecular basis for their phenotypes has been determined. However, the molecular basis of the Spo0A(A257V) substitution, representative of an unusual phenotypic class, is not understood. Spo0A(A257V) is unusual in that it abolishes sporulation; in vivo, it fails to activate transcription from key stage II promoters yet retains the ability to repress the abrB promoter. To determine how Spo0A(A257V) retains the ability to repress but not stimulate transcription, we performed a series of in vitro and in vivo assays. We found unexpectedly that the mutant protein both stimulated transcription from the spoIIG promoter and repressed transcription from the abrB promoter, albeit twofold less than the wild type. A DNA binding analysis of Spo0A(A257V) showed that the mutant protein was less able to tolerate alterations in the sequence and arrangement of its DNA binding sites than the wild-type protein. In addition, we found that Spo0A(A257V) could stimulate transcription of a mutant spoIIG promoter in vivo in which low-consensus binding sites were replaced by high-consensus binding sites. We conclude that Spo0A(A257V) is able to bind to and regulate the expression of only genes whose promoters contain high-consensus binding sites and that this effect is sufficient to explain the observed sporulation defect.",

The growing, and increasingly global, wine sector is one of the industries which is under increasing pressure to adopt approaches for environmental assessment and reporting of product-related greenhouse gas emissions. The International Organization for Vine and Wine has recently recognized the need to develop a standard and objective methodology and a related tool for calculating carbon footprint (CF). This study applied this tool to a wine previously analyzed using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The objective was to test the tool as regards both its potential and possible limitations, and thus to assess its suitability as a standard tool. Despite the tool's user-friendliness, a number of limitations were noted including the lack of accurate baseline data, a partial system boundary and the impossibility of dealing with the multi-functionality issue. When the CF and LCA results are compared in absolute terms, large discrepancies become obvious due to a number of different assumptions, as well as the modeling framework adopted. Nonetheless, in relative terms the results seem to be quite consistent. However, a critical limitation of the CF methodology was its focus on a single issue, which can lead to burden shifting. In conclusion, the study confirmed the need for both further improvement and adaptation to additional contexts and further studies to validate the use of this tool in different companies.",

Therapeutic approaches such as LYTAC1,2 and KineTAC3, have taken advantage of this to target specific proteins for degradation by fusing modified native ligands to target binding proteins. While powerful, these approaches can be limited by possible competition with the endogenous ligand(s), the requirement in some cases for chemical modification that limits genetic encodability and can complicate manufacturing, and more generally, there may not be natural ligands which stimulate endocytosis through a given receptor. Here we describe general protein design approaches for designing endocytosis triggering binding proteins (EndoTags) that overcome these challenges. We present EndoTags for the IGF-2R, ASGPR, Sortillin, and Transferrin receptors, and show that fusing these tags to proteins which bind to soluble or transmembrane protein leads to lysosomal trafficking and target degradation; as these receptors have different tissue distributions, the different EndoTags could enable targeting of degradation to different tissues. The modularity and genetic encodability of EndoTags enables AND gate control for higher specificity targeted degradation, and the localized secretion of degraders from engineered cells. The tunability and modularity of our genetically encodable EndoTags should contribute to deciphering the relationship between receptor engagement and cellular trafficking, and they have considerable therapeutic potential as targeted degradation inducers, signaling activators for endocytosis-dependent pathways, and cellular uptake inducers for targeted antibody drug and RNA conjugates.",

        "abstract": "A challenge for design of protein-small-molecule recognition is that incorporation of cavities with size, shape, and composition suitable for specific recognition can considerably destabilize protein monomers. This challenge can be overcome through binding pockets formed at homo-oligomeric interfaces between folded monomers. Interfaces surrounding the central homo-oligomer symmetry axes necessarily have the same symmetry and so may not be well suited to binding asymmetric molecules. To enable general recognition of arbitrary asymmetric substrates and small molecules, we developed an approach to designing asymmetric interfaces at off-axis sites on homo-oligomers, analogous to those found in native homo-oligomeric proteins such as glutamine synthetase. We symmetrically dock curved helical repeat proteins such that they form pockets at the asymmetric interface of the oligomer with sizes ranging from several angstroms, appropriate for binding a single ion, to up to more than 20 Å across. Of the 133 proteins tested, 84 had soluble expression in E. coli, 47 had correct oligomeric states in solution, 35 had small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data largely consistent with design models, and 8 had negative-stain electron microscopy (nsEM) 2D class averages showing the structures coming together as designed. Both an X-ray crystal structure and a cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure are close to the computational design models. The nature of these proteins as homo-oligomers allows them to be readily built into higher-order structures such as nanocages, and the asymmetric pockets of these structures open rich possibilities for small-molecule binder design free from the constraints associated with monomer destabilization.",

        "abstract": "Data binning involves grouping observations into bins and calculating bin-wise summary statistics. It can cope with overplotting and noise, making it a versatile tool for comparing many observations. However, data binning goes awry if the same observations are used for binning (selection) and contrasting (selective analysis). This creates circularity, biasing noise components and resulting in artifactual changes in the form of regression towards the mean. Importantly, these artifactual changes are a statistical necessity. Here, we use (null) simulations and empirical repeat data to expose this flaw in the scope of post hoc analyses of population receptive field data. In doing so, we reveal that the type of data analysis, data properties, and circular data cleaning are factors shaping the appearance of such artifactual changes. We furthermore highlight that circular data cleaning and circular sorting of change scores are selection practices that result in artifactual changes even without circular data binning. These pitfalls might have led to erroneous claims about changes in population receptive fields in previous work and can be mitigated by using independent data for selection purposes. Our evaluations highlight the urgency for us researchers to make the validation of analysis pipelines standard practice.",

        "abstract": "Despite remarkable advances in the assembly of highly structured coordination polymers and metal-organic frameworks, the rational design of such materials using more conformationally flexible organic ligands such as peptides remains challenging. In an effort to make the design of such materials fully programmable, we first developed a computational design method for generating metal-mediated 3D frameworks using rigid and symmetric peptide macrocycles with metal-coordinating sidechains. We solved the structures of six crystalline networks involving conformationally constrained 6 to 12 residue cyclic peptides with C2, C3, and S2 internal symmetry and three different types of metals (Zn2+, Co2+, or Cu2+) by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, which reveals how the peptide sequences, backbone symmetries, and metal coordination preferences drive the assembly of the resulting structures. In contrast to smaller ligands, these peptides associate through peptide-peptide interactions without full coordination of the metals, contrary to one of the assumptions underlying our computational design method. The cyclic peptides are the largest peptidic ligands reported to form crystalline coordination polymers with transition metals to date, and while more work is required to develop methods for fully programming their crystal structures, the combination of high chemical diversity with synthetic accessibility makes them attractive building blocks for engineering a broader set of new crystalline materials for use in applications such as sensing, asymmetric catalysis, and chiral separation.",

Local pH conditions influence the interactions through the protonation states of the ionizable residues that can change upon binding. In this work, we present a pH-sensitive docking approach, pHDock, that can sample side-chain protonation states of five ionizable residues (Asp, Glu, His, Tyr, Lys) on-the-fly during the docking simulation. pHDock produces successful local docking funnels in approximately half (79/161) the protein complexes, including 19 cases where standard RosettaDock fails. pHDock also performs better than the two control cases comprising docking at pH 7.0 or using fixed, predetermined protonation states. On average, the top-ranked pHDock structures have lower interface RMSDs and recover more native interface residue-residue contacts and hydrogen bonds compared to RosettaDock. Addition of backbone flexibility using a computationally-generated conformational ensemble further improves native contact and hydrogen bond recovery in the top-ranked structures. Although pHDock is designed to improve docking, it also successfully predicts a large pH-dependent binding affinity change in the Fc-FcRn complex, suggesting that it can be exploited to improve affinity predictions. The approaches in the study contribute to the goal of structural simulations of whole-cell protein-protein interactions including all the environmental factors, and they can be further expanded for pH-sensitive protein design.",

In this data paper, we compiled a total of 42,528 records of 31 species, represented by occurrence and quantitative data, totaling 24,847 unique georeferenced records. The geographic range is from the southern United States, Mexico, and Caribbean countries at the northern portion of the Neotropics, to the austral distribution in Argentina, Paraguay, Chile, and Uruguay. Regarding anteaters, Myrmecophaga tridactyla has the most records (n = 5,941), and Cyclopes sp. have the fewest (n = 240).

Therefore, studies on trophic cascades, hunting pressure, habitat loss, fragmentation effects, species invasion, and climate change effects will be possible with the Neotropical Xenarthrans data set.

It argues that the women's class position gave them access to various discursive resources with which to articulate their abortion stories, shaping their experiences and narration of stigma. It also draws attention to the ways in which both class and stigma are 'made through marking' on the body, and thus to the under-theorised embodied aspects of abortion stigma.

        "abstract": "The importance of neuronal glutamate to synaptic transmission throughout the brain illustrates the immense therapeutic potential and safety risks of targeting this system. Astrocytes also release glutamate, the clinical relevance of which is unknown as the range of brain functions reliant on signaling from these cells hasn't been fully established. Here, we investigated system xc- (Sxc), which is a glutamate release mechanism with an in vivo rodent expression pattern that is restricted to astrocytes. As most animals do not express Sxc, we first compared the expression and sequence of the obligatory Sxc subunit xCT among major classes of vertebrate species. We found xCT to be ubiquitously expressed and under significant negative selective pressure. Hence, Sxc likely confers important advantages to vertebrate brain function that may promote biological fitness. Next, we assessed brain function in male genetically modified rats (MSxc) created to eliminate Sxc activity. Unlike other glutamatergic mechanisms, eliminating Sxc activity was not lethal and didn't alter growth patterns, telemetry measures of basic health, locomotor activity, or behaviors reliant on simple learning. However, MSxc rats exhibited deficits in tasks used to assess cognitive behavioral control. In a pavlovian conditioned approach, MSxc rats approached a food-predicted cue more frequently than WT rats, even when this response was punished. In attentional set shifting, MSxc rats displayed cognitive inflexibility because of an increased frequency of perseverative errors. MSxc rats also displayed heightened cocaine-primed drug seeking. Hence, a loss of Sxc-activity appears to weaken control over nonreinforced or negative-outcome behaviors without altering basic brain function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Glutamate is essential to synaptic activity throughout the brain, which illustrates immense therapeutic potential and risk. Notably, glutamatergic mechanisms are expressed by most types of brain cells. Hence, glutamate likely encodes multiple forms of intercellular signaling. Here, we hypothesized that the selective manipulation of astrocyte to neuron signaling would alter cognition without producing widespread brain impairments. First, we eliminated activity of the astrocytic glutamate release mechanism, Sxc, in rat. This impaired cognitive flexibility and increased expression of perseverative, maladaptive behaviors. Notably, eliminating Sxc activity did not alter metrics of health or noncognitive brain function. These data add to recent evidence that the brain expresses cognition-specific molecular mechanisms that could lead to highly precise, safe medications for impaired cognition.",

        "title": "Polypeptides for use in self-assembling protein nanostructures",
        "abstract": "The construction of recombinant fusion/chimeric proteins has been widely used for expression of soluble proteins and protein purification in a variety of fields of protein engineering and biotechnology. Fusion proteins are constructed by the linking of two protein domains with a peptide linker. The selection of a linker sequence is important for the construction of stable and bioactive fusion proteins. Empirically designed linkers are generally classified into two categories according to their structural features: flexible linkers and rigid linkers. Rigid linkers with the α-helix-forming sequences A(EAAAK)nA (n=2-5) were first designed about two decades ago to control the distance between two protein domains and to reduce their interference. Thereafter, the helical linkers have been applied to the construction of many fusion proteins to improve expression and bioactivity. In addition, the design of fusion proteins that self-assemble into supramolecular complexes is useful for nanobiotechnology and synthetic biology. A protein that forms a self-assembling oligomer was fused by a rigid helical linker to another protein that forms another self-assembling oligomer, and the fusion protein symmetrically self-assembled into a designed protein nanoparticle or nanomaterial. Moreover, to construct chain-like polymeric nanostructures, extender protein nanobuilding blocks were designed by tandemly fusing two dimeric de novo proteins with helical or flexible linkers. The linker design of fusion proteins can affect conformation and dynamics of self-assembling nanostructures. The present review and methods focus on useful helical linkers to construct bioactive fusion proteins and protein-based nanostructures.",

        "abstract": "In view of many European countries and the USA leading to the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, winter season, the evolution of new mutations in the spike protein, and no registered drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 treatment, the discovery of effective and novel therapeutic agents is urgently required. The degrees and frequencies of COVID-19 clinical complications are related to uncontrolled immune responses, secondary bacterial infections, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and chronic pulmonary diseases. It is essential to recognize that the drug repurposing strategy so far remains the only means to manage the disease burden of COVID-19. Despite some success of using single-target drugs in treating the disease, it is beyond suspicion that the virus will acquire drug resistance by acquiring mutations in the drug target. The possible synergistic inhibition of drug efficacy due to drug-drug interaction cannot be avoided while treating COVID-19 and allied clinical complications. Hence, to avoid the unintended development drug resistance and loss of efficacy due to drug-drug interaction, multi-target drugs can be promising tools for the most challenging disease. In the present work, we have carried out molecular docking studies of compounds from the FDA approved drug library, and the FDA approved and passed phase -1 drug libraries with ten therapeutic targets of COVID-19. Results showed that known drugs, including nine anti-inflammatory compounds, four antibiotics, six antidiabetic compounds, and one cardioprotective compound, could effectively inhibit multiple therapeutic targets of COVID-19. Further in-vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies will guide these drugs' proper allocation to treat COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

        "title": "Synthetic yeast agglutination",
        "abstract": "The agalpha1 mutant MAT alpha cells specifically lack the cell surface alpha-type sexual agglutination substance, which is also called alpha-agglutinin. Because the mutant cells (MATalpha agalpha1) can not form aggregates with MATa cells, MATalpha agalpha1 cells are unable to mate with MATa cells when they are co-inoculated in a liquid medium, and the mating is attenuated on solid medium. The attenuated mating ability shown in the previous studies gave us a vague idea about a physiological function of the sexual agglutinability. In order to solve the question, mating behavior of MATalpha agalpha1 cells was investigated here under conditions where the contact between MATa and MAT alpha cells is assisted by physical methods. A synthetic mutation agalpha1::URA3 was constructed and used as well as agalpha1-1 for this study to ensure the genetic defect. When a mixture of MATa and MAT alpha cells was kept on filter membrane placed on relatively dry agar medium, even agalpha1::URA3 mutant cells mated as efficiently as the wild type (AGalpha1) cells did. On filter membrane placed on moist agar medium, agalpha1 mutants mated 10-fold less efficiently than wild type cells did. The mutant cells mated 10000-time less efficiently than the wild type cells in a pellet formed by brief low speed centrifugation. In contrast, the wild type MATalpha cells mated well under all conditions tested. Under the pellet condition, a mixture of MATa and MATalpha AG alpha1 cells formed an extended and cotton-like pellet while a mixture of MATa and MATalpha agalpha1 cells formed a compact and tight pellet. These results suggest that sexual cell agglutination contributes not only to cell contact between MATa and MAT alpha cells thereby stabilizing a-alpha cell pairs, but also to construction of a uniquely organized ultra structure favorable for zygote formation and subsequent growth of diploid cells. The mating specific extended pellet formation was observed also in 4 pairs of a and alpha strains in ascosporogenous yeast genera Hansenula and Pichia.",

        "abstract": "Coeliac disease (CD), also known as gluten sensitive enteropathy, is an autoimmune intestinal disease induced by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Gluten is a common ingredient in daily diet and is one of the main environmental factors to induce coeliac disease. Adhering to gluten free diet (GFD) is an effective method for treating CD. Microbiota plays an extremely important role in maintaining human health, and diet is the main factor to regulate the composition and function of gut microbiota. Recent studies have shown that gluten metabolism is closely related to gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota. With the increasing prevalence of coeliac disease, there is a need for alternative treatments to GFD. In this review, biological medication of gluten, relationship between gluten and gut microflora, effect of GFD on GIT microflora, and effect of probiotics on CD were reviewed. By analysing the research progress on relationship between gluten and gastrointestinal microbiome in coeliac disease, this review tried to explore the prospective and potential mechanism of microecological agents in treating coeliac disease.",

        "abstract": "From HIV and influenza to emerging pathogens like COVID-19, each new infectious disease outbreak has highlighted the need for massively-scalable testing that can be performed outside centralized laboratory settings at the point-of-care (POC) in order to prevent, track, and monitor endemic and pandemic threats. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are highly sensitive and can be developed and scaled within weeks while protein-based rapid tests require months for production. Combining NAATs with paper-based detection platforms are promising due to the manufacturability, scalability, and simplicity of each of these components. Typically, paper-based NAATs consist of three sequential steps: sample collection and preparation, amplification of DNA or RNA from pathogens of interest, and detection. However, these exist within a larger ecosystem of sample collection and interpretation workflow, usability, and manufacturability which can be vastly perturbed during a pandemic emergence. This review aims to explore the challenges of paper-based NAATs covering sample-to-answer procedures along with three main types of clinical samples; blood, urine, and saliva, as well as broader operational, scale up, and regulatory aspects of device development and implementation. To fill the technological gaps in paper-based NAATs, a sample-in-result-out system that incorporates the integrated sample collection, sample preparation, and integrated internal amplification control while also balancing needs of users and manufacturability upfront in the early design process is required.",

        "abstract": "apse is a primary design consideration for deep water locations and offshore areas with sharp seabed curvatures or spans, where bending reduces collapse resistance due to ovalization. Previous numerical and experimental work has shown that collapse resistance of steel pipes can be enhanced significantly by using compression instead of expansion during the final stage of the pipe forming process.ExxonMobil has recently undertaken a rigorous numerical modeling and experimental testing program to investigate the collapse resistance of compressed (JCOC) steel pipes under combined loading of external pressure and bending, and this paper presents the main results from the program. The first part of the paper presents results of sensitivity studies from three dimensional (3D) finite element analyses (FEA) of the pipe forming process, and the second part focuses on the collapse modeling under combined loading as well as a comparison of the numerical results with the experiments. The results indicate that the collapse envelope for steel pipes under combined external pressure and bending can be enhanced by up to 35% by adopting pipe compression rather than expansion as the final step of the forming process.Copyright © 2014 by ASME",

Approximately 38% of the students were overweight or obese, and 56.2% consumed fast food in the past 24 h. Main reasons for consuming fast foods were lack of time to cook healthy food (51%), pleasant taste (26%) and the influence of family and friends (15%). Overweight status or obesity was more prevalent among males (50%), those having greater knowledge about calories in fast-food meals (51.6%), who checked fast food calories before eating (47.7%) or overestimated the amount of sugar in a soft drink (17.82 ± 26.59 spoons). Overweight or obese participants also performed more moderate physical activity (1.73 ± 2.08 days per week) compared to those with normal weight or underweight (p = <0.05). Fast food consumption can be curtailed by improving the availability of and access to healthier foods and implementing behavior change and regulatory interventions.",

        "abstract": "Based on aerodynamic considerations, the energy use-flight speed relationship of all airborne animals and aircraft should be U-shaped. However, measures of the metabolic rate-flight speed relationship in birds have been available since Tucker's pioneering experiments with budgerigars nearly forty years ago, but this classic work remains the only study to have found a clearly U-shaped metabolic power curve. The available data suggests that the energetic requirements for flight within this species are unique, yet the metabolic power curve of the budgerigar is widely considered representative of birds in general. Given these conflicting results and the observation that the budgerigar's mass is less than 50% of the next smallest species to have been studied, we asked whether large and small birds have metabolic power curves of different shapes. To address this question we measured the rates of oxygen uptake and wingbeat kinematics in budgerigars and cockatiels flying within a variable-speed wind tunnel. These species are close phylogenetic relatives, have similar flight styles, wingbeat kinematics, and are geometrically similar but have body masses that differ by a factor of two. In contrast to our expectations, we found the metabolic rate-flight speed relationship of both species to be acutely U-shaped. We also found that neither budgerigars nor cockatiels used their normal intermittent flight style while wearing a respirometric mask. We conclude that species size differences alone do not explain the previously unique metabolic power curve of the budgerigar; however, due to the absence of comparable data we cannot evaluate whether the mask-related kinematic response we document influences the metabolic rate-flight speed relationship of these parrots, or whether the energetics of flight differ between this and other avian clades.",

Here, multiple rational design methods were used to engineer ICAM-1 mutants with enhanced affinity for LFA-1. Five amino acid substitutions 1) enhance the hydrophobicity and packing of residues surrounding Glu-34 of ICAM-1, which coordinates to a Mg2+ in the LFA-1 I domain, and 2) alter associations at the edges of the binding interface. The affinity of the most improved ICAM-1 mutant for intermediate- and high-affinity LFA-1 I domains was increased by 19-fold and 22-fold, respectively, relative to wild type. Moreover, potency was similarly enhanced for inhibition of LFA-1-dependent ligand binding and cell adhesion. Thus, rational design can be used to engineer novel adhesion molecules with high monomeric affinity; furthermore, the ICAM-1 mutant holds promise for targeting LFA-1-ICAM-1 interaction for biological studies and therapeutic purposes.",

Here, we develop and apply a methodology for monthly estimates and uncertainties during the period 1998-2019, which combines satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth, chemical transport modeling, and ground-based measurements to allow for the characterization of seasonal and episodic exposure, as well as aid air-quality management. Many densely populated regions have their highest PM2.5 concentrations in winter, exceeding summertime concentrations by factors of 1.5-3.0 over Eastern Europe, Western Europe, South Asia, and East Asia. In South Asia, in January, regional population-weighted monthly mean PM2.5 concentrations exceed 90 μg/m3, with local concentrations of approximately 200 μg/m3 for parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. In East Asia, monthly mean PM2.5 concentrations have decreased over the period 2010-2019 by 1.6-2.6 μg/m3/year, with decreases beginning 2-3 years earlier in summer than in winter. We find evidence that global-monitored locations tend to be in cleaner regions than global mean PM2.5 exposure, with large measurement gaps in the Global South. Uncertainty estimates exhibit regional consistency with observed differences between ground-based and satellite-derived PM2.5. The evaluation of uncertainty for agglomerated values indicates that hybrid PM2.5 estimates provide precise regional-scale representation, with residual uncertainty inversely proportional to the sample size.",

We aimed to fill this gap by analysing a large cohort of individuals selected from the ARCA database. The impact on VF of pre-existent resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) and cumulative genotypic susceptibility score (cGSS) before STR start was evaluated through survival analysis. Potential emergence of resistance at VF was also evaluated. Overall, 3916 individuals were included, comprising 678 treatment-naïve (G1), 2309 treatment-experienced aviraemic (G2) and 929 viraemic (G3), of whom 65.2% were treated with a STR based on efavirenz (35.2%) or rilpivirine (30.0%). At 2 years after starting a STR, the overall probability of VF was 5.9% in G1, 8.7% in G2 and 20.8% in G3. No impact of pre-existent resistance on VF was found in G1. The probability of VF was higher in patients with cGSS < 3 (reduced susceptibility to at least one drug) than in those with cGSS = 3 (full susceptibility to STR drugs) both in G2 and G3. A higher probability of VF was also found in the presence of pre-existent M184V (alone or in combination with pre-existent thymidine analogue mutations). Among patients who failed STR, a significant emergence of RAMs was found only in those exposed to EFV/FTC/TDF in G3 (specifically K103N and M184V). Our results confirm a high efficacy of STRs in clinical settings. Pre-existent resistance appears to influence virological efficacy of STRs in treatment-experienced individuals (both aviraemic and viraemic).",

If not properly processed or protected against recontamination, or if temperature-abused, REPFEDs may present serious health risks. However, control is readily available. Sound microbial ecology, supported by expert risk assessment, allows the design and introduction of longitudinally integrated manufacture, distribution, handling by outlets and consumers and culinary preparation, which result in the assurance of the wholesomeness of the commodity as eaten. Recent progress, including intrinsic preservation by the incorporation of starter cultures, bacteriocins or particular enzymes, opens vistas for attractive future developments. Once microbiological safety has been built into the REPFED-line, monitoring can be limited to (i) real-time tests particularly applied to the factory environment; and (ii) rapid, simple examination for marker organisms of freshly manufactured products versus those approaching expiration dates. Such audits will allow rapid retrieval of incidental process failure and its rectification. It also serves to substantiate measurements of food temperature and spot checks on intrinsic inhibitory attributes. The application of scientific knowledge and technological expertise should primarily be entrusted to the industry itself, heeding Lord Plumb's strategy of \"partnership along the food production chain from farm to fork.\" It should be supported and validated by Public Health Authorities.

By averaging sequence logits between diffusion trajectories with distinct structural constraints, we designed multistate parent-child protein triples in which the same sequence folds to different supersecondary structures when intact in the parent versus split into two child domains.

Here, we investigate the properties of a mini-protein, mb7, developed by an in silico design strategy to bind to the ligand-binding region of FGFR2. We describe structural, biophysical, and cellular analyses demonstrating that mb7 binds with high affinity to the c-isoforms of FGFR, resulting in inhibition of cellular signaling induced by a subset of FGFs that preferentially activate c-isoforms of FGFR. Notably, as mb7 blocks interaction between FGFR with Klotho proteins, it functions as an antagonist of the metabolic hormones FGF19 and FGF21, providing mechanistic insights and strategies for the development of therapeutics for diseases driven by aberrantly activated FGFRs.",

        "abstract": "uate research experiences can improve student success in graduate education and STEM careers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, undergraduate researchers at our institution and many others lost their work-study research positions due to interruption of in-person research activities. This imposed a financial burden on the students and eliminated an important learning opportunity. To address these challenges, we created a paid, fully-remote, cohort-based research curriculum in computational protein design. Our curriculum used existing protein design methods as a platform to first educate and train undergraduate students and then to test research hypotheses. In the first phase, students learned computational methods to assess the stability of designed protein assemblies. In the second phase, students used a larger dataset to identify factors that could improve the accuracy of current protein design algorithms. This cohort-based program created valuable new research opportunities for undergraduates at our institute and enhanced the undergraduates’ feeling of connection with the lab. Students learned transferable and useful skills such as literature review, programming basics, data analysis, hypothesis testing, and scientific communication. Our program provides a model of structured computational research training opportunities for undergraduate researchers in any field for organizations looking to expand educational access.

        "abstract": "iated changes in the structure of the intestinal microbiome and in its interaction with the brain via the gut-brain axis are increasingly being implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Intestinal microbial dysbiosis and translocation of microbes and microbial products including fungal species into the brain have been implicated in the development of dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease. Using germ-free mice, we investigated if the fungal gut commensal, Candida albicans, an opportunistic pathogen in humans, can traverse the gastrointestinal barrier and disseminate to brain tissue and whether ageing impacts on the gut mycobiome as a pre-disposing factor in fungal brain infection. C. albicans was detected in different regions of the brain of colonised germ-free mice in both yeast and hyphal cell forms, often in close association with activated (Iba-1+) microglial cells. Using high-throughput ITS1 amplicon sequencing to characterise the faecal gut fungal composition of aged and young SPF mice, we identified several putative gut commensal fungal species with pathobiont potential although their abundance was not significantly different between young and aged mice. Collectively, these results suggest that although some fungal species can travel from the gut to brain where they can induce an inflammatory response, ageing alone is not correlated with significant changes in gut mycobiota composition which could predispose to these events. These results are consistent with a scenario in which significant disruptions to the gut microbiota or intestinal barrier, beyond those which occur with natural ageing, are required to allow fungal escape and brain infection.",

Of particular concern are the reports of pESI, a multidrug resistance (MDR) encoding megaplasmid, in isolates from multiple countries, but little is known about its presence or diversity in South Africa. Whole genome sequences of 387 S. Infantis isolates from South Africa (2004-2020) were analysed for genetic phylogeny, recombination frequency, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants, plasmid presence and overall gene content. The population structure of South African S. Infantis was substantially different to S. Infantis reported elsewhere; only two thirds of isolates belonged to eBG31, while the remainder were identified as eBG297, a much rarer group globally. Significantly higher levels of recombination were observed in the eBG297 isolates, which was associated with the presence of prophages. The majority of isolates were putatively susceptible to antimicrobials (335/387) and lacked any plasmids (311/387); the megaplasmid pESI was present in just one isolate. A larger proportion of eBG31 isolates, 19% (49/263), contained at least one AMR determinant, compared to eBG297 at 2% (3/124). Comparison of the pan-genomes of isolates from either eBG identified 943 genes significantly associated with eBG, with 43 found exclusively in eBG31 isolates and 34 in eBG297 isolates. This, along with the single nucleotide polymorphism distance and difference in resistance profiles, suggests that eBG31 and eBG297 isolates occupy different niches within South Africa. If antibiotic-resistant S. Infantis emerges in South Africa, probably through the spread of the pESI plasmid, treatment of this infection would be compromised.",

However, all TIS methods described to date use short nucleotide sequence reads which cannot uniquely determine the locations of transposon insertions within repeating genomic sequences where the repeat units are longer than the sequence read length. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a TIS method using Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology that generates and uses long nucleotide sequence reads; we have called this method LoRTIS (Long-Read Transposon Insertion-site Sequencing). LoRTIS enabled the unique localisation of transposon insertion sites within long repetitive genetic elements of E. coli, such as the transposase genes of insertion sequences and copies of the ~ 5 kb ribosomal RNA operon. We demonstrate that LoRTIS is reproducible, gives comparable results to short-read TIS methods for essential genes, and better resolution around repeat elements. The Oxford Nanopore sequencing device that we used is cost-effective, small and easily portable. Thus, LoRTIS is an efficient means of uniquely identifying transposon insertion sites within long repetitive genetic elements and can be easily transported to, and used in, laboratories that lack access to expensive DNA sequencing facilities.",

        "abstract": "The paralogues RrpA and RrpB, which are members of the MarR family of DNA binding proteins, are important for the survival of the global bacterial foodborne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni under redox stress. We report that RrpA is a positive regulator of mdaB, encoding a flavin-dependent quinone reductase that contributes to the protection from redox stress mediated by structurally diverse quinones, while RrpB negatively regulates the expression of cj1555c (renamed nfrA for NADPH-flavin reductase A), encoding a flavin reductase. NfrA reduces riboflavin at a greater rate than its derivatives, suggesting that exogenous free flavins are the natural substrate. MdaB and NfrA both prefer NADPH as an electron donor. Cysteine substitution and posttranslational modification analyses indicated that RrpA and RrpB employ a cysteine-based redox switch. Complete genome sequence analyses revealed that mdaB is frequently found in Campylobacter and related Helicobacter spp., while nfrA is predominant in C. jejuni strains. Quinones and flavins are redox cycling agents secreted by a wide range of cell types that can form damaging superoxide by one-electron reactions. We propose a model for stress adaptation where MdaB and NfrA facilitate a two-electron reduction mechanism to the less toxic hydroquinones, thus aiding survival and persistence of this major pathogen. IMPORTANCE Changes in cellular redox potential result in alteration in the oxidation state of intracellular metabolites and enzymes; consequently, cells make adjustments that favor growth and survival. The work we present here answers some of the many questions that have remained elusive over the years of investigation into the enigmatic microaerophile bacterium Campylobacter jejuni. We employed molecular approaches to understand the regulation mechanisms and functional analyses to reveal the roles of two novel quinone and flavin reductases; both serve as major pools of cellular redox-active molecules.

        "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy diagnosed in children and adolescents with a high propensity for local invasion and distant metastasis. Despite current multidisciplinary treatments, there has not been a drastic change in overall prognosis within the last two decades. With current treatments, 60-70 % of patients with localized disease survive. Given a propensity of Wnt signaling to control multiple cellular processes, including proliferation, cell fate determination, and differentiation, it is a critical pathway in OS disease progression. At the same time, this pathway is extremely complex with vast arrays of cross-talk. Even though decades of research have linked the role of Wnt to tumorigenesis, there are still outstanding areas that remain poorly understood and even controversial. The canonical Wnt pathway functions to regulate the levels of the transcriptional co-activator β-catenin, which ultimately controls key developmental gene expressions. Given the central role of this mediator, inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been investigated as a potential strategy for cancer control. In OS, several secreted protein families modulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, including secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs), Wnt inhibitory protein (WIF), Dickkopf proteins (DKK-1,2,3), sclerostin, and small molecules. This chapter focuses on our current understanding of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in OS, based on recent in vitro and in vivo data. Wnt activates noncanonical signaling pathways as well that are independent of β-catenin which will be discussed. In addition, stem cells and their association with Wnt/β-catenin are important factors to consider. Ultimately, the multiple canonical and noncanonical Wnt/β-catenin agonists and antagonists need to be further explored for potential targeted therapies.",

        "abstract": "n of stable proteins with custom-made functions is a major goal in biochemistry with practical relevance for our environment and society. High conformational stability lowers protein sensitivity to mutations and changes in the environment; thus, understanding and manipulating protein stability will expand the applications of de novo proteins. Since the (β/α)8-barrel or TIM-barrel fold is one of the most common functional scaffolds, in this work we designed a collection of stable de novo TIM barrels (NovoTIMs), using a computational fixed-backbone and modular approach based on improved hydrophobic packing of sTIM11, the first validated de novo TIM barrel. NovoTIMs navigate a region of the stability landscape previously uncharted by natural TIM barrels, with variations spanning 60 degrees in melting temperature and 25 kcal per mol in conformational stability throughout the designs. Significant non-additive or epistatic effects were observed when stabilizing mutations from different regions of the barrel were combined. The molecular basis of epistasis in NovoTIMs appears to be related to the extension of the hydrophobic cores. This study is an important step towards the fine-tuned modulation of protein stability by design. Significance Statement De novo protein design expands our knowledge about protein structure and stability. The TIM barrel is a highly relevant fold used in nature to host a rich variety of catalytic functions. Here, we follow a modular approach to design and characterize a collection of de novo TIM barrels and subjected them to a thorough folding analysis. Non-additive effects modulate the increase in stability when different regions of the barrel are mutated, showing a wide variety of thermodynamic properties that allow them to navigate an unexplored region of the stability landscape found in natural TIM barrels. The design of stable proteins increases the applications of de novo proteins and provides more information on the molecular determinants that modulate structure and stability.",

In the Mekong region this is associated with mutations in the kelch propeller-encoding domain of pfkelch13, but variants of other parasite proteins are also thought to modulate the response to drug. Evidence from human and rodent studies suggests that the μ-subunit of the AP-2 adaptin trafficking complex is one such protein of interest. We generated transgenic Plasmodium falciparum parasites encoding the I592T variant of pfap2μ, orthologous to the I568T mutation associated with in vivo artemisinin resistance in P. chabaudi. When exposed to a four-hour pulse of dihydroartemisin in the ring-stage survival assay, two P. falciparum clones expressing AP-2μ I592T displayed significant and reproducible survival of 8.0% and 10.3%, respectively, compared to <2% for the 3D7 parental line (P = 0.0011 for each clone). In immunoprecipitation and localisation studies of HA-tagged AP-2μ, we identified interacting partners including AP-2α, AP-1/2β, AP-2σ and a kelch-domain protein encoded on chromosome 10 of P. falciparum, K10. Conditional knockout indicates that the AP-2 trafficking complex in P. falciparum is essential for the fidelity of merozoite biogenesis and membrane organisation in the mature schizont. We also show that while other heterotetrameric AP-complexes and secretory factors interact with clathrin, AP-2 complex subunits do not. Thus, the AP-2 complex may be diverted from a clathrin-dependent endocytic role seen in most eukaryotes into a Plasmodium-specific function. These findings represent striking divergences from eukaryotic dogma and support a role for intracellular traffic in determining artemisinin sensitivity in vitro, confirming the existence of multiple functional routes to reduced ring-stage artemisinin susceptibility. Therefore, the utility of pfkelch13 variants as resistance markers is unlikely to be universal, and phenotypic surveillance of parasite susceptibility in vivo may be needed to identify threats to our current combination therapies.",

Here, we sought to better understand the host-dependent drivers of simarterivirus pathogenesis by infecting olive baboons (n = 4) and rhesus monkeys (n = 4) with the simarterivirus Southwest baboon virus 1 (SWBV-1). Surprisingly, none of the animals in our study showed signs of disease following SWBV-1 inoculation. Three animals (two rhesus monkeys and one olive baboon) became infected and sustained high levels of SWBV-1 viremia for the duration of the study. The course of SWBV-1 infection was highly predictable: plasma viremia peaked between 1 × 10⁷ and 1 × 10⁸ vRNA copies/mL at 3⁻10 days post-inoculation, which was followed by a relative nadir and then establishment of a stable set-point between 1 × 10⁶ and 1 × 10⁷ vRNA copies/mL for the remainder of the study (56 days). We characterized cellular and antibody responses to SWBV-1 infection in these animals, demonstrating that macaques and baboons mount similar responses to SWBV-1 infection, yet these responses are ineffective at clearing SWBV-1 infection. SWBV-1 sequencing revealed the accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in a region of the genome that corresponds to an immunodominant epitope in the simarterivirus major envelope glycoprotein GP5, which likely contribute to viral persistence by enabling escape from host antibodies.",

Eleven years later, because postoperative pancreatic fistula remains one of the most relevant and harmful complications of pancreatic operation, the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula classification has become the gold standard in defining postoperative pancreatic fistula in clinical practice. The aim of the present report is to verify the value of the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula definition and grading of postoperative pancreatic fistula and to update the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula classification in light of recent evidence that has emerged, as well as to address the lingering controversies about the original definition and grading of postoperative pancreatic fistula.",

        "abstract": "In the ten years since the initial publication of the RenSeq protocol, the method has proved to be a powerful tool for studying disease resistance in plants and providing target genes for breeding programmes. Since the initial publication of the methodology, it has continued to be developed as new technologies have become available and the increased availability of computing power has made new bioinformatic approaches possible. Most recently, this has included the development of a k-mer based association genetics approach, the use of PacBio HiFi data, and graphical genotyping with diagnostic RenSeq. However, there is not yet a unified workflow available and researchers must instead configure approaches from various sources themselves. This makes reproducibility and version control a challenge and limits the ability to perform these analyses to those with bioinformatics expertise.",

        "title": "Collective learning as a key concept in big history",
        "abstract": "e key concepts for the human part of the grand narrative is known as ‘collective learning’. It is a very prominent broad trend that sweeps across all human history. Collective learning to a certain degree distinguishes us as a species; it got us out of Africa and the foraging lifestyle of the Palaeolithic, and underpinned demographic cycles and human progress for over 250,000 years. The present article looks at collective learning as a concept, its evolution within hominine species, as well as its role in human demography and the two great revolutions in human history: agriculture and industry. The paper then goes on to explain the connection of collective learning to Jared Diamond's ‘Tasmanian Effect’. Collective learning also played a key role in the two ‘Great Divergences’ of the past two thousand years. One is industry and the rise of the West, described to great effect by Kenneth Pommeranz, the other is the less well known: the burst of demography and innovation in Song China at the turn of the second millennium AD. Finally, the paper concludes with insights into how collective learning forges a strong connection between human history and cosmology, geology, and biology, through what is widely recognized as one of the ‘unifying themes’ of Big History – the rise of complexity in the Universe.",

        "abstract": "Computational protein design promises the ability to build tailor-made proteins de novo. While a range of de novo proteins have been constructed so far, the majority of these designs have idealized topologies that lack larger cavities which are necessary for the incorporation of small molecule binding sites or enzymatic functions. One attractive target for enzyme design is the TIM-barrel fold, due to its ubiquity in nature and capability to host versatile functions. With the successful de novo design of a 4-fold symmetric TIM barrel, sTIM11, an idealized, minimalistic scaffold was created. In this work, we attempted to extend this de novo TIM barrel by incorporating a helix-loop-helix motif into its βα-loops by applying a physics-based modular design approach using Rosetta. Further diversification was performed by exploiting the symmetry of the scaffold to integrate two helix-loop-helix motifs into the scaffold. Analysis with AlphaFold2 and biochemical characterization demonstrate the formation of additional α-helical secondary structure elements supporting the successful extension as intended.",

        "title": "Template scoring methods for protein torsion angle prediction",
        "abstract": "Computational protein design is a reverse procedure of protein folding and structure prediction, where constructing structures from evolutionarily related proteins has been demonstrated to be the most reliable method for protein 3-dimensional structure prediction. Following this spirit, we developed a novel method to design new protein sequences based on evolutionarily related protein families. For a given target structure, a set of proteins having similar fold are identified from the PDB library by structural alignments. A structural profile is then constructed from the protein templates and used to guide the conformational search of amino acid sequence space, where physicochemical packing is accommodated by single-sequence based solvation, torsion angle, and secondary structure predictions. The method was tested on a computational folding experiment based on a large set of 87 protein structures covering different fold classes, which showed that the evolution-based design significantly enhances the foldability and biological functionality of the designed sequences compared to the traditional physics-based force field methods. Without using homologous proteins, the designed sequences can be folded with an average root-mean-square-deviation of 2.1 Å to the target. As a case study, the method is extended to redesign all 243 structurally resolved proteins in the pathogenic bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is the second leading cause of death from infectious disease. On a smaller scale, five sequences were randomly selected from the design pool and subjected to experimental validation. The results showed that all the designed proteins are soluble with distinct secondary structure and three have well ordered tertiary structure, as demonstrated by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Together, these results demonstrate a new avenue in computational protein design that uses knowledge of evolutionary conservation from protein structural families to engineer new protein molecules of improved fold stability and biological functionality.",

        "abstract": "Vaccines prevent infectious disease largely by inducing protective neutralizing antibodies against vulnerable epitopes. Several major pathogens have resisted traditional vaccine development, although vulnerable epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies have been identified for several such cases. Hence, new vaccine design methods to induce epitope-specific neutralizing antibodies are needed. Here we show, with a neutralization epitope from respiratory syncytial virus, that computational protein design can generate small, thermally and conformationally stable protein scaffolds that accurately mimic the viral epitope structure and induce potent neutralizing antibodies. These scaffolds represent promising leads for the research and development of a human respiratory syncytial virus vaccine needed to protect infants, young children and the elderly. More generally, the results provide proof of principle for epitope-focused and scaffold-based vaccine design, and encourage the evaluation and further development of these strategies for a variety of other vaccine targets, including antigenically highly variable pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus and influenza.",

Would not it be useful for the students to understand the evolution of our planet within the context of the evolution of our Universe? The need to see this process of development holistically, in its origins and growing complexity, is fundamental to what drives not only science but the human imagination. This shared vision of the grand narrative is one of the most effective ways to conceptualize and integrate our growing knowledge of the Universe, society, and human thought.

        "abstract": "Clopidogrel used in conjunction with aspirin has a central role in the treatment of patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to this drug are highly variable leaving up to one third of patients with inadequate platelet inhibition or high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR), and subsequent increased ischemic cardiovascular events. Genetic variability in drug absorption and metabolism is a key factor responsible for the inefficient generation of the active drug metabolite. The two-step hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependant oxidative metabolism of the prodrug appears to be of particular importance. Pharmacogenomic analyses have identified loss-of-function variant alleles of CYP 2C19 and specifically the 2C19*2 allele, to be the predominant genetic mediators of the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel. Carriers were have been shown to have lower active metabolite levels of clopidogrel, higher platelet reactivity and associated poorer outcomes. Rapid and accurate point-of-care genetic tests to identify these alleles are currently in development but several questions about the role of such testing remain such as patient selection and whether personalized treatment based on genotype has a positive impact on clinical outcome. At present, genetic testing cannot be recommended in routine clinical practice due to insufficient prospective data. However, the significant body of research published to date suggests a likely role when used in combination with platelet function analysis in ACS patients undergoing stenting who have other known risk factors for recurrent ischemic events.",

        "abstract": "It is easy for today's students and researchers to believe that modern bioinformatics emerged recently to assist next-generation sequencing data analysis. However, the very beginnings of bioinformatics occurred more than 50 years ago, when desktop computers were still a hypothesis and DNA could not yet be sequenced. The foundations of bioinformatics were laid in the early 1960s with the application of computational methods to protein sequence analysis (notably, de novo sequence assembly, biological sequence databases and substitution models). Later on, DNA analysis also emerged due to parallel advances in (i) molecular biology methods, which allowed easier manipulation of DNA, as well as its sequencing, and (ii) computer science, which saw the rise of increasingly miniaturized and more powerful computers, as well as novel software better suited to handle bioinformatics tasks. In the 1990s through the 2000s, major improvements in sequencing technology, along with reduced costs, gave rise to an exponential increase of data. The arrival of 'Big Data' has laid out new challenges in terms of data mining and management, calling for more expertise from computer science into the field. Coupled with an ever-increasing amount of bioinformatics tools, biological Big Data had (and continues to have) profound implications on the predictive power and reproducibility of bioinformatics results. To overcome this issue, universities are now fully integrating this discipline into the curriculum of biology students. Recent subdisciplines such as synthetic biology, systems biology and whole-cell modeling have emerged from the ever-increasing complementarity between computer science and biology.",

Following debate on the human health risk from exposure to tritium, there have been claims that the current biokinetic model recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) may underestimate tritium doses. A new generic model for tritium in mammals, based on energy metabolism and body composition, together with all its input data, has been described in a recent paper and successfully tested for farm and laboratory mammals. That model considers only dietary intake of tritium and was extended to humans. This paper presents the latest development of the human model with explicit consideration of brain energy metabolism. Model testing with human experimental data on organically bound tritium (OBT) in urine after tritiated water (HTO) or OBT intakes is presented. Predicted absorbed doses show a moderate increase for OBT intakes compared with doses recommended by the ICRP. Infants have higher tritium retention-a factor of 2 longer than the ICRP estimate. The highest tritium concentration is in adipose tissue, which has a very low radiobiological sensitivity. The ranges of uncertainty in retention and doses are investigated. The advantage of the new model is its ability to be applied to the interpretation of bioassay data.",

        "abstract": "Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), commonly known as cytokine storm, is an acute systemic inflammatory response that is a significant global health threat. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) are key pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in CRS and are hence critical therapeutic targets. Current antagonists, such as tocilizumab and anakinra, target IL-6R/IL-1R but have limitations due to their long half-life and systemic anti-inflammatory effects, making them less suitable for acute or localized treatments. Here we present the de novo design of small protein antagonists that prevent IL-1 and IL-6 from interacting with their receptors to activate signaling. The designed proteins bind to the IL-6R, GP130 (an IL-6 co-receptor), and IL-1R1 receptor subunits with binding affinities in the picomolar to low-nanomolar range. X-ray crystallography studies reveal that the structures of these antagonists closely match their computational design models. In a human cardiac organoid disease model, the IL-1R antagonists demonstrated protective effects against inflammation and cardiac damage induced by IL-1β. These minibinders show promise for administration via subcutaneous injection or intranasal/inhaled routes to mitigate acute cytokine storm effects.",

However, the lack of defined structures and the high variability in sequence and conformational preferences has complicated such efforts. We sought to develop a method combining biophysical principles with deep learning to readily generate binders for any disordered sequence. Instead of assuming a fixed regular structure for the target, general recognition is achieved by threading the query sequence through diverse extended binding modes in hundreds of templates with varying pocket depths and spacings, followed by RFdiffusion refinement to optimize the binder-target fit. We tested the method by designing binders to 39 highly diverse unstructured targets. Experimental testing of ~36 designs per target yielded binders with affinities better than 100 nM in 34 cases, and in the pM range in four cases. The co-crystal structure of a designed binder in complex with dynorphin A is closely consistent with the design model. All by all binding experiments for 20 designs binding diverse targets show they are highly specific for the intended targets, with no crosstalk even for the closely related dynorphin A and dynorphin B. Our approach thus could provide a general solution to the intrinsically disordered protein and peptide recognition problem.",

We used this approach to design proteins binding to TGFβRII, CTLA-4 and PD-L1 which following experimental optimization have low nanomolar to picomolar affinities and potent biological activity. Co-crystal structures of the TGFβRII and CTLA-4 binders in complex with the receptors are in close agreement with the design models.

The trained ensemble performed an in silico functional screen on 1,423 novel, uncharacterized GCaMP variants. As a result, we identified the ensemble-derived GCaMP (eGCaMP) variants, eGCaMP and eGCaMP+, which achieve both faster kinetics and larger ∆F/F0 responses upon stimulation than previously published fast variants. Furthermore, we identified a combinatorial mutation with extraordinary dynamic range, eGCaMP2+, which outperforms the tested sixth-, seventh- and eighth-generation GCaMPs.

Here, we show that starting only from the target sequence of the input, and freely sampling both target and binding protein conformation, RFdiffusion can generate binders to IDPs and IDRs in a wide range of conformations. We use this approach to generate binders to the IDPs Amylin, C-peptide and VP48 in a range of conformations with Kds in the 3 -100nM range. The Amylin binder inhibits amyloid fibril formation and dissociates existing fibers, and enables enrichment of amylin for mass spectrometry-based detection. For the IDRs G3bp1, common gamma chain (IL2RG) and prion, we diffused binders to beta strand conformations of the targets, obtaining 10 to 100 nM affinity. The IL2RG binder colocalizes with the receptor in cells, enabling new approaches to modulating IL2 signaling. Our approach should be widely useful for creating binders to flexible IDPs/IDRs spanning a wide range of intrinsic conformational preferences.",

The cytosolic isozyme HDAC6 is unique among the greater family of deacetylases in that it contains two catalytic domains, CD1 and CD2. HDAC6 CD2 is responsible for tubulin deacetylase and tau deacetylase activities, inhibition of which is a key goal as new therapeutic approaches are explored. Of particular interest as HDAC inhibitors are naturally occurring cyclic tetrapeptides such as Trapoxin A or HC Toxin, or the cyclic depsipeptides Largazole and Romidepsin. Even more intriguing are larger, computationally designed macrocyclic peptide inhibitors. Here, we report the 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure of HDAC6 CD2 complexed with macrocyclic octapeptide 1. Comparison with the previously reported structure of the complex with macrocyclic octapeptide 2 reveals that a potent thiolate-zinc interaction made by the unnatural amino acid (S)-2-amino-7-sulfanylheptanoic acid contributes to nanomolar inhibitory potency for each inhibitor. Apart from this zinc-binding residue, octapeptides adopt strikingly different overall conformations and make few direct hydrogen bonds with the protein. Intermolecular interactions are dominated by water-mediated hydrogen bonds; in essence, water molecules appear to cushion the enzyme-octapeptide interface. In view of the broad specificity observed for protein substrates of HDAC6 CD2, we suggest that the binding of macrocyclic octapeptides may mimic certain features of the binding of macromolecular protein substrates.",

        "abstract": "Campylobacter species are the major cause of bacterial gastroenteritis. As there is no effective vaccine, combined with the rapid increase in antimicrobial resistant strains, there is a need to identify new targets for intervention. Essential genes are those that are necessary for growth and/or survival, making these attractive targets. In this study, comprehensive transposon mutant libraries were created in six C. jejuni strains, four C. coli strains and one C. lari and C. hyointestinalis strain, allowing for those genes that cannot tolerate a transposon insertion being called as essential. Comparison of essential gene lists using core genome analysis can highlight those genes which are common across multiple strains and/or species. Comparison of C. jejuni and C. coli, the two species that cause the most disease, identified 316 essential genes. Genes of interest highlighted members of the purine pathway being essential for C. jejuni whilst also finding that a functional potassium uptake system is essential. Protein-protein interaction networks using these essential gene lists also highlighted proteins in the purine pathway being major 'hub' proteins which have a large number of interactors across the network. When adding in two more species (C. lari and C. hyointestinalis) the essential gene list reduces to 261. Within these 261 essential genes, there are many genes that have been found to be essential in other bacteria. These include htrB and PEB4, which have previously been found as core virulence genes across Campylobacter species in other studies. There were 21 genes which have no known function with eight of these being associated with the membrane. These surface-associated essential genes may provide attractive targets. The essential gene lists presented will help to prioritise targets for the development of novel therapeutic and preventative interventions.",

Molecular simulations suggest that the DLP forms via direct condensation of solvated Ca²+⋅(HCO3-)2 complexes that react due to proximity effects in the confined DLP droplets.

        "title": "Competitive Displacement of De Novo Designed HeteroDimers Can Reversibly Control Protein–Protein Interactions and Implement Feedback in Synthetic Circuits",
        "abstract": "imerization is a common regulatory interaction between biological molecules, underpinning many signaling functions. Because of its ubiquity, many biological engineering efforts have focused on building dimerizing proteins, such as the SYNZIPs and de novo Designed HeteroDimers (DHDs). Using the DHDs as a model system, we show that low-affinity protein interactions can be competitively displaced by a high-affinity ‘‘dominant negative’’ heterodimer. We demonstrate the utility of this signaling motif by using competitive displacement to implement negative feedback in a synthetic circuit. Competitive displacement could be extended to other heterodimer systems to expand the functionality of protein circuits and enable new biotechnology applications. Introduction Biotechnology often draws inspiration from the natural world to inform the design of strategies for regulating biology. Proteins play a central role in transmitting information in biological systems, and thus their regulation is a major thrust of synthetic biology. Protein–protein interactions play a critical role in regulating signal transduction. Many transcription factors (TFs) utilize dimerization to control their activity, such as basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, which play important roles in differentiation and whose dysregulation can cause cancer. One such bHLH, MyoD, can either homodimerize or heterodimerize with other bHLHs, including E47 and E12, to activate transcription. Other bHLHs, including Group D bHLHs, contain the HLH domain needed for dimerization but lack the basic region needed for transcriptional activation. Consequently, Group D proteins can bind other bHLHs to negatively regulate their activity. For example, the Group D Id protein is able to preferentially bind MyoD, E47, or E12 to attenuate their ability to bind DNA, thus repressing their transcriptional programs. The relative abundances of these proteins determine the differentiation state of muscle cells. This example showcases how both transcriptional activation and repression can be highly regulated through the joining and competition of TF dimerization. Such protein–protein interactions are, therefore, promising engineering targets for achieving complex and novel cellular functions. Although protein-based circuits are ubiquitously used for endogenous biological regulation, methods for synthetic modulation of protein–protein interactions remain limited. Previous work in synthetic biology has focused on using high-affinity binders to create activation signals. This highly modular strategy can be used to reconstitute split proteins or colocalize signaling molecules.

Many of these applications utilize SYNZIPs, which are a library of highly characterized synthetic bZIP proteins. However, far less work has been dedicated to building inhibitory binding reactions that can interrupt the function of the dimerized partners, like those seen in endogenous pathways. Furthermore, inhibitory binding could be used in synthetic circuits to tune dose responses or implement composable negative regulation and feedback, enabling the construction of complex circuits that more closely approximate endogenous signaling. Recently, a library of de novo Designed HeteroDimers (DHDs) was computationally designed using Rosetta HBNet. Each heterodimer pair shares the same four-helix bundle backbone structure, and specificity was achieved by incorporating asymmetric hydrogen bond networks into the backbone. Monomers were generated by using short loops to connect pairs of helices, and six heterodimer pairs were observed to be fully orthogonal through a yeast two-hybrid assay. Each designed pair is referred to by a number, and each monomer within a pair is designated as A or B, that is, 37A and 37B make up the designed 37 ontarget interaction. The functionality of the DHD library was demonstrated through the construction of multicomponent protein logic gates that regulate split-protein activity and transcription in yeast and T cells. In this study, we extend the functionality of the DHD library by demonstrating that the binding of the dimerized partners can be reversed. Specifically, we show that dominant negative (DN) heterodimers can competitively displace weaker interactions to implement negative regulation of split proteins. We first present an extended characterization of a subset of the DHD library using a titratable split TF system. Using a selection of four DHD pairs, we study all possible combinations of interactions between individual DHD monomers and identify several novel low-affinity off-target interactions. We show that these low-affinity interactions can be competitively displaced by introducing the on-target high-affinity heterodimer, referred to here as the ‘‘dominant negative’’ (DN). We characterize the properties of the DN and dynamics of competitive displacement, and use this information to design a negative feedback circuit that utilizes a DN to implement negative regulation. The application of competitive displacement to control other split proteins offers a promising strategy that could greatly expand the scope of protein circuits for a variety of biotechnology and therapeutic applications.",

        "abstract": "Anthrax is considered one of the most dangerous bioweapon agents, and concern about multidrug-resistant strains has led to the development of alternative therapeutic approaches that target the antiphagocytic capsule, an essential virulence determinant of Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent. Capsule depolymerase is a γ-glutamyltransferase that anchors the capsule to the cell wall of B. anthracis. Encapsulated strains of B. anthracis can be treated with recombinant capsule depolymerase to enzymatically remove the capsule and promote phagocytosis and killing by human neutrophils. Here, we show that pegylation improved the pharmacokinetic and therapeutic properties of a previously described variant of capsule depolymerase, CapD-CP, when delivered 24 hours after exposure every 8 hours for 2 days for the treatment of mice infected with B. anthracis. Mice infected with 382 LD50 of B. anthracis spores from a nontoxigenic encapsulated strain were completely protected (10 of 10) after treatment with the pegylated PEG-CapD-CPS334C, whereas 10% of control mice (1 of 10) survived with control treatment using bovine serum albumin (P < 0.0001, log-rank analysis). Treatment of mice infected with five LD50 of a fully virulent toxigenic, encapsulated B. anthracis strain with PEG-CapD-CPS334C protected 80% (8 of 10) of the animals, whereas 20% of controls (2 of 10) survived (P = 0.0125, log-rank analysis). This strategy renders B. anthracis susceptible to innate immune responses and does not rely on antibiotics. These findings suggest that enzyme-catalyzed removal of the capsule may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of multidrug- or vaccine-resistant anthrax and other bacterial infections.",

Nevertheless, some species like Tubastraea coccinea and T. tagusensis have been spreading very fast replacing the native ones which affect the local environment and decrease biodiversity of corals and other organisms associated with them. Despite some focal efforts to understand the biology of these organisms, they remain understudied at the molecular level. This knowledge gap hinders the development of cost-effective strategies for both conservation and management of invasive species. In this circumstance, it is expected that genome sequencing would provide powerful insights that could lead to better strategies for prevention, management, and control of this and other invasive species. Here, we present three genomes of Tubastraea spp. in one of the most comprehensive biological studies of corals, that includes flow cytometry, karyotyping, transcriptomics, genomics, and phylogeny. The genome of T. tagusensis is organized in 23 chromosomes pairs and has 1.1 Gb, the T. coccinea genome is organized in 22 chromosome pairs and has 806 Mb, and the Tubastraea sp. genome is organized in 21 chromosome pairs and has 795 Mb. The hybrid assembly of T. tagusensis using short and long-reads has a N50 of 227,978 bp, 7,996 contigs and high completeness estimated as 91.6% of BUSCO complete genes, of T. coccinea has a N50 of 66,396 bp, 17,214 contigs and 88.1% of completeness, and of Tubastraea sp. has a N50 of 82,672 bp, 12,922 contigs and also 88.1% of completeness.

We provide evidence for exclusive Scleractinia and Tubastraea gene content related to adhesion and immunity. The Tubastraea spp. genomes are a fundamental study which promises to provide insights not only about the genetic basis for the extreme invasiveness of this particular coral genus, but to understand the adaptation flaws of some reef corals in the face of anthropic-induced environmental disturbances.

        "abstract": "This paper shows that the various computations underlying spatial cognition can be implemented using statistical inference in a single probabilistic model. Inference is implemented using a common set of 'lower-level' computations involving forward and backward inference over time. For example, to estimate where you are in a known environment, forward inference is used to optimally combine location estimates from path integration with those from sensory input. To decide which way to turn to reach a goal, forward inference is used to compute the likelihood of reaching that goal under each option. To work out which environment you are in, forward inference is used to compute the likelihood of sensory observations under the different hypotheses. For reaching sensory goals that require a chaining together of decisions, forward inference can be used to compute a state trajectory that will lead to that goal, and backward inference to refine the route and estimate control signals that produce the required trajectory. We propose that these computations are reflected in recent findings of pattern replay in the mammalian brain. Specifically, that theta sequences reflect decision making, theta flickering reflects model selection, and remote replay reflects route and motor planning. We also propose a mapping of the above computational processes onto lateral and medial entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.",

This review will summarize the progress made over the last decade on the use of enzymatic-based methodologies for the production of site-specific labeled immunoconjugates of interest for nuclear medicine. Enzymes used in this field, including microbial transglutaminase, sortase, galactosyltransferase, and lipoic acid ligase, will be overviewed and their recent applications in the radiopharmaceutical field will be described. Since nuclear medicine can benefit greatly from the production of homogenous derivatives, we hope that this review will aid the use of enzymes for the development of better radio-conjugates for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.",

Middle income earners are experiencing the sharpest decline in ownership rates. Housing affordability issues have changed the makeup of the housing market over the last decade. Not only are fewer households able to break into the housing market but those who do hold onto mortgages for longer. Low and middle income households have been affected most by higher house prices with a reduction in both outright ownership and the number of people who hold mortgages. In contrast, households with higher incomes are holding mortgages for longer but are not experiencing as much difficulty entering the market.",

The first true monomer was mRFP1, derived from the Discosoma sp. fluorescent protein \"DsRed\" by directed evolution first to increase the speed of maturation, then to break each subunit interface while restoring fluorescence, which cumulatively required 33 substitutions. Although mRFP1 has already proven widely useful, several properties could bear improvement and more colors would be welcome. We report the next generation of monomers. The latest red version matures more completely, is more tolerant of N-terminal fusions and is over tenfold more photostable than mRFP1.

        "abstract": "Archaeal class I CCA-adding enzymes use a ribonucleoprotein template to build and repair the universally conserved 3'-terminal CCA sequence of the acceptor stem of all tRNAs. A wealth of structural and biochemical data indicate that the Archaeoglobus fulgidus CCA-adding enzyme binds primarily to the tRNA acceptor stem through a long, highly conserved alpha-helix that lies nearly parallel to the acceptor stem and makes many contacts with its sugar-phosphate backbone. Although the geometry of this alpha-helix is nearly ideal in all available cocrystal structures, the helix contains a highly conserved, potentially helix-breaking proline or glycine near the N terminus. We performed a mutational analysis to dissect the role of this residue in CCA-addition activity. We found that the phylogenetically permissible P295G mutant and the phylogenetically absent P295T had little effect on CCA addition, whereas P295A and P295S progressively interfered with CCA addition (C74>C75>A76 addition). We also examined the effects of these mutations on tRNA binding and the kinetics of CCA addition, and performed a computational analysis using Rosetta Design to better understand the role of P295 in nucleotide transfer. Our data indicate that CCA-adding activity does not correlate with the stability of the pre-addition cocrystal structures visualized by X-ray crystallography. Rather, the data are consistent with a transient conformational change involving P295 of the tRNA-binding alpha-helix during or between one or more steps in CCA addition.",

However, because of the high dimensionality of the search space, there are far more ways to degrade the quality of a near native model than to improve it, and hence, refinement methods are very sensitive to energy function errors. In the 13th Critial Assessment of techniques for protein Structure Prediction (CASP13), we sought to carry out a thorough search for low energy states in the neighborhood of a starting model using restraints to avoid straying too far. The approach was reasonably successful in improving both regions largely incorrect in the starting models as well as core regions that started out closer to the correct structure. Models with GDT-HA over 70 were obtained for five targets and for one of those, an accuracy of 0.5 å backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) was achieved. An important current challenge is to improve performance in refining oligomers and larger proteins, for which the search problem remains extremely difficult.",

Lungs were resected, frozen and cryostat sections stained with monoclonal antibodies that recognize relevant guinea pig epitopes. Cyanide-resistant peroxidase activity was used to stain eosinophils. No further increase in T-lymphocytes or eosinophils was observed 2 h after challenge.

The numbers of T-lymphocytes remained stable but a novel population of cells with the appearance of dendritic cells was seen in the bronchial wall. They were negative for macrophage markers but were strongly Class II positive. These findings suggest that antigenic challenge results in further recruitment of eosinophils, their activation and release of toxic substances to the epithelium.

We sought to overcome this challenge using the classic catalytic triad and oxyanion hole of serine hydrolases as a model system. We used RFdiffusion1 to generate proteins housing catalytic sites of increasing complexity and varying geometry, and a newly developed ensemble generation method called ChemNet to assess active site geometry and preorganization at each step of the reaction. Experimental characterization revealed novel serine hydrolases that catalyze ester hydrolysis with catalytic efficiencies (k cat /K m ) up to 3.8 x 103 M-1 s-1, closely match the design models (Cα RMSDs < 1 Å), and have folds distinct from natural serine hydrolases. In silico selection of designs based on active site preorganization across the reaction coordinate considerably increased success rates, enabling identification of new catalysts in screens of as few as 20 designs. Our de novo buildup approach provides insight into the geometric determinants of catalysis that complements what can be obtained from structural and mutational studies of native enzymes (in which catalytic group geometry and active site makeup cannot be so systematically varied), and provides a roadmap for the design of industrially relevant serine hydrolases and, more generally, for designing complex enzymes that catalyze multi-step transformations.",

To investigate the photophysics of special pairs independently of the complexities of native photosynthetic proteins, and as a first step toward creating synthetic photosystems for new energy conversion technologies, we designed C2-symmetric proteins that hold two chlorophyll molecules in closely juxtaposed arrangements. X-ray crystallography confirmed that one designed protein binds two chlorophylls in the same orientation as native special pairs, whereas a second designed protein positions them in a previously unseen geometry. Spectroscopy revealed that the chlorophylls are excitonically coupled, and fluorescence lifetime imaging demonstrated energy transfer. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of a designed 24-chlorophyll octahedral nanocage with a special pair on each edge closely matched the design model.

Most of the mineralized tooth structure is composed of dentin, a material produced and mineralized by ectomesenchyme derived cells known as odontoblasts. Clinicians, scientists, and the general public share the desire to regenerate this missing tooth structure. To bioengineer missing dentin, increased understanding of human tooth development is required. Here we interrogate at the single cell level the signaling interactions that guide human odontoblast and ameloblast development and which determine incisor or molar tooth germ type identity. During human odontoblast development, computational analysis predicts that early FGF and BMP activation followed by later HH signaling is crucial. Application of this sci-RNA-seq analysis generates a differentiation protocol to produce mature hiPSC derived odontoblasts in vitro (iOB). Further, we elucidate the critical role of FGF signaling in odontoblast maturation and its biomineralization capacity using the de novo designed FGFR1/2c isoform specific minibinder scaffolded as a C6 oligomer that acts as a pathway agonist. We find that FGFR1c is upregulated in functional odontoblasts and specifically plays a crucial role in driving odontoblast maturity. Using computational tools, we show on a molecular level how human molar development is delayed compared to incisors. We reveal that enamel knot development is guided by FGF and WNT in incisors and BMP and ROBO in the molars, and that incisor and molar ameloblast development is guided by FGF, EGF and BMP signaling, with tooth type specific intensity of signaling interactions. Dental ectomesenchyme derived cells are the primary source of signaling ligands responsible for both enamel knot and ameloblast development.",

In addition, male (but not female) mice showed a lower respiratory exchange ratio on both chow and high fat diets, indicating a predisposition to metabolise lipid. Lipidomic studies on specific fat depots found reduced triglyceride and diglyceride deposition in male Cd248-/- mice, and this was supported by reduced expression of lipogenic and adipogenic genes. Finally, metabolomic analysis of isolated, differentiated preadipocytes found alterations in metabolic pathways associated with lipid deposition in cells isolated from male, but not female, Cd248-/- mice.

In coronaviruses, this work is predominantly aimed at targeting conserved epitopes of the receptor-binding domain. However, targeting other conserved non-RBD epitopes could further limit the potential for antigenic escape. To further explore new potential targets, we engineered protein nanoparticles displaying CoV_S-2P trimers derived from MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, hCoV-HKU1, and hCoV-OC43 and assessed their immunogenicity in mice. Monotypic SARS-1_S-2P nanoparticles elicited cross-neutralizing antibodies against MERS_S and protected against MERS-CoV challenge. MERS and SARS-I53_dn5 nanoparticles elicited S1-focused antibodies, revealing a conserved site on the NTD. Moreover, mosaic nanoparticles co-displaying distinct CoV_S-2P trimers elicited antibody responses to distant cross-group antigens while protecting against MERS challenge despite diminished valency of MERS_S-2P. Our findings will inform further efforts towards the development of pan-coronavirus vaccines.",

        "abstract": "rmance of cover songs in popular music has long been a subject of critical discussion and debate due to the artistic, social, cultural, and commercial issues that covers raise. In non-Western societies, most popular songs covered by artists are Anglo-American, a situation which implicitly privileges Western music and reinforces both the “west and the rest” trope and the cultural imperialism thesis. Taking American amateur artists and their online videos performing Filipino popular music as case studies, this article examines how social media platforms facilitate and problematize center-periphery relations in popular music through a diffusion of cultural products “from the rest to the west.” Moreover, we show that more than the promise of audience reach, the phenomenon reflects how these cover artists embody cultural and social situatedness in Filipino culture. As they mimic the mimics, they also embody an identity in motion.",

Here, we investigated the capacity of modified versions of one lead miniprotein, LCB1, to protect against SARS-CoV-2-mediated lung disease in mice. Systemic administration of LCB1-Fc reduced viral burden, diminished immune cell infiltration and inflammation, and completely prevented lung disease and pathology. A single intranasal dose of LCB1v1.3 reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung when given as many as 5 days before or 2 days after virus inoculation. Importantly, LCB1v1.3 protected in vivo against a historical strain (WA1/2020), an emerging B.1.1.7 strain, and a strain encoding key E484K and N501Y spike protein substitutions.

Each PP1 complex controls the dephosphorylation of only a small subset of PP1 substrates. We screened the literature for genetically engineered mouse models and identified models for all PP1 isoforms and 104 PIPs. PP1 itself and at least 49 PIPs were connected to human disease-associated phenotypes. Additionally, phenotypes related to 17 PIPs were clearly linked to altered PP1 function, while such information was lacking for 32 other PIPs. We propose structural reverse genetics, which combines structural characterization of proteins with mouse genetics, to identify new PP1-related therapeutic targets.

Here we explore the possibility of designing switchable protein systems de novo, through the modulation of competing inter- and intramolecular interactions. We design a static, five-helix 'cage' with a single interface that can interact either intramolecularly with a terminal 'latch' helix or intermolecularly with a peptide 'key'. Encoded on the latch are functional motifs for binding, degradation or nuclear export that function only when the key displaces the latch from the cage. We describe orthogonal cage-key systems that function in vitro, in yeast and in mammalian cells with up to 40-fold activation of function by key. The ability to design switchable protein functions that are controlled by induced conformational change is a milestone for de novo protein design, and opens up new avenues for synthetic biology and cell engineering.",

However, the precise chromatin loci of functional H3K27me3 marks are not yet known. Here we identify critical PRC2 functional sites at a single nucleosome resolution. We fused a computationally designed protein, EED binder (EB) that competes with EZH2 and thereby disrupts PRC2 function, to dCas9 (EBdCas9) to direct PRC2 inhibition at a precise locus using gRNA. We targeted EBdCas9 to 4 different genes (TBX18, p16, CDX2 and GATA3) and observed epigenetic remodeling at a single nucleosome resolution resulting in gene activation. Remarkably, while traditional TATA box is located 30bp upstream of TSS, we identified a functional TATA box, >500bp of TSS, normally repressed by PRC2 complex. Deletion of this TATA box eliminates EBdCas9 dependent TBP recruitment and transcriptional activation. Targeting EBdCas9 to CDX2 and GATA3 results in trophoblast trans-differentiation.

Because of the large chemical space spanned by drug-like molecules, classical force fields contain thousands of parameters describing atom-pair distance and torsional preferences; each parameter is typically optimized independently on simple representative molecules. Here we describe a new approach in which small-molecule force field parameters are jointly optimized guided by the rich source of information contained within thousands of available small molecule crystal structures. We optimize parameters by requiring that the experimentally determined molecular lattice arrangements have lower energy than all alternative lattice arrangements. Thousands of independent crystal lattice-prediction simulations were run on each of 1,386 small molecule crystal structures, and energy function parameters of an implicit solvent energy model were optimized so native crystal lattice arrangements had lowest energy. The resulting energy model was implemented in Rosetta, together with a rapid genetic algorithm docking method employing grid based scoring and receptor flexibility. The success rate of bound structure recapitulation in cross-docking on 1,112 complexes was improved by more than 10% over previously published methods, with solutions within <1 Å in over half of the cases. Our results demonstrate that small molecule crystal structures are a rich source of information for systematically improving computational drug discovery.",

However, how calcium is mobilized from intracellular stores in the absence of canonical calcium channels in Plasmodium is unknown. Here, we identify a multipass membrane protein, ICM1, with homology to transporters and calcium channels that is tightly associated with PKG in both asexual blood stages and transmission stages. Phosphoproteomic analyses reveal multiple ICM1 phosphorylation events dependent on PKG activity. Stage-specific depletion of Plasmodium berghei ICM1 prevents gametogenesis due to a block in intracellular calcium mobilization, while conditional loss of Plasmodium falciparum ICM1 is detrimental for the parasite resulting in severely reduced calcium mobilization, defective egress, and lack of invasion. Our findings suggest that ICM1 is a key missing link in transducing PKG-dependent signals and provide previously unknown insights into atypical calcium homeostasis in malaria parasites essential for pathology and disease transmission.",

This is harder for challenging environmental samples such as soil, which is rich in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) inhibitors. To address this, we have established a low-cost genomic DNA extraction method for soil samples. We also present an Illumina-compatible 16S and ITS rRNA gene amplicon library preparation workflow that uses common laboratory equipment. We evaluated the performance of our genomic DNA extraction method against two leading commercial soil genomic DNA kits (MoBio PowerSoil® and MP Biomedicals™ FastDNA™ SPIN) and a recently published non-commercial extraction method by Zou et al. (PLoS Biology, 15, e2003916, 2017). Our benchmarking experiment used four different soil types (coniferous, broad-leafed, and mixed forest plus a standardized cereal crop compost mix) assessing the quality and quantity of the extracted genomic DNA by analyzing sequence variants of 16S V4 and ITS rRNA amplicons. We found that our genomic DNA extraction method compares well to both commercially available genomic DNA extraction kits in DNA quality and quantity. The MoBio PowerSoil® kit, which relies on silica column-based DNA extraction with extensive washing, delivered the cleanest genomic DNA, for example, best A260:A280 and A260:A230 absorbance ratios. The MP Biomedicals™ FastDNA™ SPIN kit, which uses a large amount of binding material, yielded the most genomic DNA. Our method fits between the two commercial kits, producing both good yields and clean genomic DNA with fragment sizes of approximately 10 kb. Comparative analysis of detected amplicon sequence variants shows that our method correlates well with the two commercial kits. Here, we present a low-cost genomic DNA extraction method for soil samples that can be coupled to an Illumina-compatible simple two-step amplicon library construction workflow for 16S V4 and ITS marker genes. Our method delivers high-quality genomic DNA at a fraction of the cost of commercial kits and enables cost-effective, large-scale amplicon sequencing projects. Notably, our extracted gDNA molecules are long enough to be suitable for downstream techniques such as full gene sequencing or even metagenomics shotgun approaches using long reads (PacBio or Nanopore), 10x Genomics linked reads, and Dovetail genomics.",

We show that this high-throughput workflow of multiplex genetic selections followed by large-scale sequencing and comparative analysis allows not only the determination of relative affinities, but also the monitoring of specificity profiles for hundreds to thousands of protein-protein and protein-small molecule interactions in parallel. The approach not only identifies new interactions of designed proteins, but also detects unintended and undesirable off-target interactions. This provides a general framework for screening of engineered protein binders, which often have no negative selection or design step as part of their development pipelines.

Business leaders are grappling with dysfunctional business models that are ill-equipped to manage the disruptive environment of growing artificial intelligence. Hence, this study examined the discontinuous shift in the scope and culture of business models by exploring interdisciplinary streams of literature. An integrative review methodology was used in this study to develop theoretical constructs relating to business model innovation in the services sector. Key propositions were an innovation continuum, a responsive business innovation model and value architecture, which inculcates a sustainable value creation proposition and market advantage. Businesses must continuously evolve on the high end of the innovation continuum to reduce the risk of innovation apathy and strategic myopia. A key contribution of this study was the interdependencies in value networks that allow for collaborative working and co-creation of resources, such as crowdsourcing, crowdworking and social media platforms. This study also showed the growing importance of a centre of excellence to function at the forefront of disruptive technologies. A key finding was the need for governance structures to recognise and manage the trade-offs between value drivers, which sometimes may conflict with societal benefits. The integrative review revealed that customer relationship management, global business services and artificial intelligence had not been unified in the extant literature, which makes this paper novel in its contribution to businesses struggling with or opposed to the digital revolution.",

In response to popular concern about the rising cost of childcare the incumbent Howard Government announced the Child Care Tax Rebate during the 2004 election campaign. The policy provided a capped 30 per cent tax rebate to all families using formal childcare. At the 2007 election the Opposition campaigned on raising the rebate to 50 per cent and was elected to form government. This article measures the proportion of household disposable income spent on childcare costs and compares this cost:income ratio with reported difficulties to assess the effectiveness of this policy in making childcare more affordable. The potential influence of increased debate about childcare affordability and policy responses during election campaigns is also considered. It is concluded that this policy has at best provided only short-term benefits to families and that reported cost difficulties appear to be affected in some part by policy announcements.",

        "abstract": "Protein structure prediction is a way to bridge the sequence-structure gap, one of the main challenges in computational biology and chemistry. Predicting any protein's accurate structure is of paramount importance for the scientific community, as these structures govern their function. Moreover, this is one of the complicated optimization problems that computational biologists have ever faced. Experimental protein structure determination methods include X-ray crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Electron Microscopy. All of these are tedious and time-consuming procedures that require expertise. To make the process less cumbersome, scientists use predictive tools as part of computational methods, using data consolidated in the protein repositories. In recent years, machine learning approaches have raised the interest of the structure prediction community. Most of the machine learning approaches for protein structure prediction are centred on co-evolution based methods. The accuracy of these approaches depends on the number of homologous protein sequences available in the databases. The prediction problem becomes challenging for many proteins, especially those without enough sequence homologs. Deep learning methods allow for the extraction of intricate features from protein sequence data without making any intuitions. Accurately predicted protein structures are employed for drug discovery, antibody designs, understanding protein-protein interactions, and interactions with other molecules. This article provides a review of conventional and deep learning approaches in protein structure prediction. We conclude this review by outlining a few publicly available datasets and deep learning architectures currently employed for protein structure prediction tasks.",

The Rosetta fragment insertion protocol was used to generate models for entire target domains without detectable sequence similarity to a protein of known structure and to build long loop insertions (and N-and C-terminal extensions) in cases where a structural template was available. Encouraging results were obtained both for the de novo predictions and for the long loop insertions; we describe here the successes as well as the failures in the context of current efforts to improve the Rosetta method. In particular, de novo predictions failed for large proteins that were incorrectly parsed into domains and for topologically complex (high contact order) proteins with swapping of segments between domains. However, for the remaining targets, at least one of the five submitted models had a long fragment with significant similarity to the native structure. A fully automated version of the CASP5 protocol produced results that were comparable to the human-assisted predictions for most of the targets, suggesting that automated genomic-scale, de novo protein structure prediction may soon be worthwhile. For the three targets where the human-assisted predictions were significantly closer to the native structure, we identify the steps that remain to be automated.",

It is a two terminal device whose resistance state is based on the history of charge flow brought about as the result of the voltage being applied across its terminals and hence can be thought of as a special case of a reconfigurable resistor. Nanoscale devices using dense and regular fabrics such as Memristor cross-bar is promising new architecture for System-on-Chip (SoC) implementations in terms of not only the integration density that the technology can offer but also both improved performance and reduced power dissipation. Memristor has the capacity to switch between high and low resistance states in a cross-bar circuit configuration. The cross-bars are formed from an array of vertical conductive nano-wires cross a second array of horizontal conductive wires. Memristors are realized at the intersection of the two wires in the array through appropriate processing technology such that any particular wire in the vertical array can be connected to a wire in the horizontal array by switching the resistance of a particular intersection to a low state while other cross-points remain in a high resistance state. However the approach introduces a number of challenges. The lack of voltage gain prevents logic being cascaded and voltage level degradation affects robustness of the operation. Moreover the cross-bars introduce sneak current paths when two or more cross points are connected through the switched Memristor. In this paper, we propose Memristor-based programmable logic array (PLA) architecture and develop an analytical model to analyze the logic level on the memristive networks. The proposed PLA architecture has 12 inputs maximum and can be cascaded for more input variables with R(off)/R(on) ratio in the range from 55 to 160 of Memristors.",

Here, a facile process is developed to create a glass-glass encapsulated semitransparent PSC using thermocompression bonding. From quantifying the interfacial adhesion energy and considering the power conversion efficiency of devices, it is confirmed that bonding between perovskite layers formed on a hole transport layer (HTL)/indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) glass and an electron transport layer (ETL)/ITO glass can offer an excellent lamination method. The PSCs fabricated through this process have only buried interfaces between the perovskite layer and both charge transport layers as the perovskite surface is transformed into bulk. The thermocompression process leads the perovskite to have larger grains and smoother, denser interfaces, thereby not only reducing defect and trap density but also suppressing ion migration and phase segregation under illumination. In addition, the laminated perovskite demonstrates enhanced stability against water. The self-encapsulated semitransparent PSCs with a wide-band-gap perovskite (Eg ∼ 1.67 eV) demonstrate a power conversion efficiency of 17.24% and maintain long-term stability with PCE > ∼90% in the 85 °C shelf test for over 3000 h and with PCE > ∼95% under AM 1.5 G, 1-sun illumination in an ambient atmosphere for over 600 h.",

However, the underlying structural principles governing such heterochiral protein-protein interactions remain largely unknown. In this study, we present the de novo design of D-proteins consisting of 50-65 residues, aiming to target specific surface regions of L-proteins or L-peptides. Our designer D-protein binders exhibit nanomolar affinity toward an artificial L-peptide, as well as two naturally occurring proteins of therapeutic significance: the D5 domain of human tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) and human interleukin-6 (IL-6). Notably, these D-protein binders demonstrate high enantiomeric specificity and target specificity. In cell-based experiments, designer D-protein binders effectively inhibited the downstream signaling of TrkA and IL-6 with high potency. Moreover, these binders exhibited remarkable thermal stability and resistance to protease degradation. Crystal structure of the designed heterochiral D-protein-L-peptide complex, obtained at a resolution of 2.0 Å, closely resembled the design model, indicating that the computational method employed is highly accurate. Furthermore, the crystal structure provides valuable information regarding the interactions between helical L-peptides and D-proteins, particularly elucidating a novel mode of heterochiral helix-helix interactions. Leveraging the design of D-proteins specifically targeting L-peptides or L-proteins opens up avenues for systematic exploration of the mirror-image protein universe, paving the way for a diverse range of applications.",

Three-finger toxins (3FTx) are highly toxic components of elapid snake venoms that can cause diverse pathologies, including severe tissue damage3 and inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) resulting in life-threatening neurotoxicity4. Currently, the only available treatments for snakebite consist of polyclonal antibodies derived from the plasma of immunized animals, which have high cost and limited efficacy against 3FTxs5,6,7. Here, we use deep learning methods to de novo design proteins to bind short- and long-chain α-neurotoxins and cytotoxins from the 3FTx family. With limited experimental screening, we obtain protein designs with remarkable thermal stability, high binding affinity, and near-atomic level agreement with the computational models. The designed proteins effectively neutralize all three 3FTx sub-families in vitro and protect mice from a lethal neurotoxin challenge. Such potent, stable, and readily manufacturable toxin-neutralizing proteins could provide the basis for safer, cost-effective, and widely accessible next-generation antivenom therapeutics.

In this study, we found that intranasal delivery of neomycin, a generic aminoglycoside antibiotic, induces the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the nasal mucosa that is independent of the commensal microbiota. Prophylactic or therapeutic administration of neomycin provided significant protection against upper respiratory infection and lethal disease in a mouse model of COVID-19. Furthermore, neomycin treatment protected Mx1 congenic mice from upper and lower respiratory infections with a highly virulent strain of influenza A virus.

        "abstract": "isplay the remarkable ability to detect single foreign peptides displayed on target cells, while ignoring highly abundant self peptides. This selectivity has been explained by kinetic proofreading in the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, which prevents responses to short-lived binding events regardless of their abundance. However, the biochemical mechanisms that drive kinetic proofreading have remained unclear. Here, using computational modeling, we show that these key signaling properties of the TCR pathway can emerge from the dynamics of LAT phosphorylation, diffusion, and condensation following TCR-pMHC binding. In this model, time delays in LAT condensate nucleation underlie kinetic proofreading, enabling selective signaling responses to high-affinity pMHC ligands. The cooperativity in the nucleation and growth of LAT condensates also provides a mechanism to amplify weak signals from single foreign peptides and for condensates to grow with increasing antigen numbers. In contrast to other models, condensate-nucleation proofreading predicts a dependence of signal strength on pMHC spacing at fixed number, a prediction we validated experimentally using a protein scaffold to present pMHCs at defined intervals. Our results suggest that nucleation-condensation proofreading underlies the remarkable antigen detection capabilities of the TCR signaling pathway. Significance To fight infections and cancer, T-cells must selectively recognize low levels of foreign peptides from pathogens or cancer cells, but the mechanisms that enable these properties have remained unclear.Using mathematical modeling and experiments, we find that T-cells can selectively detect single foreign peptides through a clustering process where a key protein downstream of the T-cell receptor forms condensates containing hundreds of signaling proteins. This condensate nucleation process can explain experimentally observed features of T-cell signaling, including our finding that the size of signaling clusters depends on the distance between foreign peptides. Our work reveals a key role for the condensation of signaling molecules in setting the spatial and temporal thresholds that control the sensitivity and selectivity of T-cells.",

By contrast, specificity of protein-protein interactions usually involves backbone shape complementarity1, which is less modular and hence harder to generalize. Coiled-coil heterodimers are an exception, but the restricted geometry of interactions across the heterodimer interface (primarily at the heptad a and d positions2) limits the number of orthogonal pairs that can be created simply by varying side-chain interactions3,4. Here we show that protein-protein interaction specificity can be achieved using extensive and modular side-chain hydrogen-bond networks. We used the Crick generating equations5 to produce millions of four-helix backbones with varying degrees of supercoiling around a central axis, identified those accommodating extensive hydrogen-bond networks, and used Rosetta to connect pairs of helices with short loops and to optimize the remainder of the sequence. Of 97 such designs expressed in Escherichia coli, 65 formed constitutive heterodimers, and the crystal structures of four designs were in close agreement with the computational models and confirmed the designed hydrogen-bond networks. In cells, six heterodimers were fully orthogonal, and in vitro-following mixing of 32 chains from 16 heterodimer designs, denaturation in 5 M guanidine hydrochloride and reannealing-almost all of the interactions observed by native mass spectrometry were between the designed cognate pairs. The ability to design orthogonal protein heterodimers should enable sophisticated protein-based control logic for synthetic biology, and illustrates that nature has not fully explored the possibilities for programmable biomolecular interaction modalities.",

In vivo library selection is an effective method for identifying constructs that exhibit desired distribution behavior; library variants can be selected based on their ability to localize to the tissue or compartment of interest despite complex physiological challenges. Here, we describe further development of an in vivo library selection platform based on self-assembling protein nanoparticles encapsulating their own mRNA genomes (synthetic nucleocapsids or synNCs). We tested two distinct libraries: a low-diversity library composed of synNC surface mutations (45 variants) and a high-diversity library composed of synNCs displaying miniproteins with binder-like properties (6.2 million variants). While we did not identify any variants from the low-diversity surface library that yielded therapeutically relevant changes in biodistribution, the high-diversity miniprotein display library yielded variants that shifted accumulation toward lungs or muscles in just two rounds of in vivo selection. Our approach should contribute to achieving specific tissue homing patterns and identifying targeting ligands for diseases of interest.",

        "abstract": "Many naturally occurring protein assemblies have dynamic structures that allow them to perform specialized functions. For example, clathrin coats adopt a wide variety of architectures to adapt to vesicular cargos of various sizes. Although computational methods for designing novel self-assembling proteins have advanced substantially over the past decade, most existing methods focus on designing static structures with high accuracy. Here we characterize the structures of three distinct computationally designed protein assemblies that each form multiple unanticipated architectures, and identify flexibility in specific regions of the subunits of each assembly as the source of structural diversity. Cryo-EM single-particle reconstructions and native mass spectrometry showed that only two distinct architectures were observed in two of the three cases, while we obtained six cryo-EM reconstructions that likely represent a subset of the architectures present in solution in the third case. Structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the surprising observation of a defined range of architectures, instead of non-specific aggregation, can be explained by constrained flexibility within the building blocks. Our results suggest that deliberate use of structural flexibility as a design principle will allow exploration of previously inaccessible structural and functional space in designed protein assemblies.",

However, the rapid development of resistance to current clinical Ras G12C inhibitors is common. Presumably, a subpopulation of RasG12C-expressing cells adapt their signaling to evade these inhibitors and the mechanisms for this phenomenon are unclear due to the lack of tools that can measure signaling with single-cell resolution. Here, we utilized recently developed Ras sensors to profile the environment of active Ras and to measure the activity of endogenous Ras in order to pair structure (Ras signalosome) to function (Ras activity), respectively, at a single-cell level. With this approach, we identified a subpopulation of KRasG12C cells treated with RasG12C-GDP inhibitors underwent oncogenic signaling and metabolic changes driven by WT Ras at the golgi and mutant Ras at the mitochondria, respectively. Our Ras sensors identified Major Vault Protein (MVP) as a mediator of Ras activation at both compartments by scaffolding Ras signaling pathway components and metabolite channels. We found that recently developed RasG12C-GTP inhibitors also led to MVP-mediated WT Ras signaling at the golgi, demonstrating that this a general mechanism RasG12C inhibitor resistance. Overall, single-cell analysis of structure-function relationships enabled the discovery of a RasG12C inhibitor-resistant subpopulation driven by MVP, providing insight into the complex and heterogenous rewiring occurring during drug resistance in cancer.",

        "abstract": "Ordered two-dimensional arrays such as S-layers1,2 and designed analogues3-5 have intrigued bioengineers6,7, but with the exception of a single lattice formed with flexible linkers8, they are constituted from just one protein component. Materials composed of two components have considerable potential advantages for modulating assembly dynamics and incorporating more complex functionality9-12. Here we describe a computational method to generate co-assembling binary layers by designing rigid interfaces between pairs of dihedral protein building blocks, and use it to design a p6m lattice. The designed array components are soluble at millimolar concentrations, but when combined at nanomolar concentrations, they rapidly assemble into nearly crystalline micrometre-scale arrays nearly identical to the computational design model in vitro and in cells without the need for a two-dimensional support. Because the material is designed from the ground up, the components can be readily functionalized and their symmetry reconfigured, enabling formation of ligand arrays with distinguishable surfaces, which we demonstrate can drive extensive receptor clustering, downstream protein recruitment and signalling. Using atomic force microscopy on supported bilayers and quantitative microscopy on living cells, we show that arrays assembled on membranes have component stoichiometry and structure similar to arrays formed in vitro, and that our material can therefore impose order onto fundamentally disordered substrates such as cell membranes. In contrast to previously characterized cell surface receptor binding assemblies such as antibodies and nanocages, which are rapidly endocytosed, we find that large arrays assembled at the cell surface suppress endocytosis in a tunable manner, with potential therapeutic relevance for extending receptor engagement and immune evasion. Our work provides a foundation for a synthetic cell biology in which multi-protein macroscale materials are designed to modulate cell responses and reshape synthetic and living systems.",

        "abstract": "iomarkers of inflammation have been correlated with poor renal outcomes and mortality in DKD. However, an effective, well-tolerated treatment of progressive renal disease driven by inflammation has remained elusive. Inhibition of IL-33 may provide a novel opportunity to address this unmet medical need in high-risk patients. Here, we: 1) show that tozorakimab, a high-affinity IL-33-neutralizing mAb, promotes glomerular health in inflammation; 2) describe the clinical study to test tozorakimab in patients with DKD; 3) present participant baseline characteristics; and 4) evaluate inflammation-associated biomarker in FRONTIER-1 and four external validation cohorts.\n \n \n \n FRONTIER-1 (NCT04170543) is a phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of tozorakimab in patients with DKD; defined as T2DM with an eGFR of 25-75 mL/min/1.73 m2 and a UACR in the range of 100-3,000 mg/g. All participants are expected to receive an ACEi/ARB for > 6 weeks before the treatment period. Approximately 565 patients from multiple countries will be randomized to four dose levels of tozorakimab, or volume-matched placebo dosed subcutaneously every 28 days over a 24-week treatment period. All participants will receive 10 mg dapagliflozin Day 85-168. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of tozorakimab on albuminuria. Secondary objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of tozorakimab with and without SGLT2i, evaluate the effect of tozorakimab in combination with ACEi or ARB with and without SGLT2i on albuminuria, and describe the PK and immunogenicity of tozorakimab. Key exploratory objective is to assess baseline and treatment-response for urine and/or circulating biomarkers of inflammation, including hsCRP, IL-33/sIL1RL1, CCL2, and TNFR-1/2. Biomarker response was, furthermore, evaluated in pre-clinical models of DKD, and respective distributions and risk were assessed in four independent DKD cohorts (N > 200).\n \n \n \n Transcriptomic profiling of kidney biopsies from patients with DKD indicated a significant glomerular up-regulation of IL-33. Inhibition of IL-33 signalling reduced glomerular damage and albuminuria in the uninephrectomized db/db mouse model of DKD. This was associated with improved glomerular endothelial health as indicated by decreased cellular inflammation and reduced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNFR-1, and CCL2. Hence, FRONTIER-1 was started in 2019. So far, all trial groups are well-balanced and in line with our expectations for this patient population (N = 574). At baseline, > 95% were receiving ACEi/ARBs and approximately 25% were receiving SGLT2i. The mean eGFR was 47.8 ml/min/1,73 m2 (+/- 14.7) and mean UACR was 765 mg/g (+/- 775). The inflammatory state of participants at baseline was assessed in circulation and urine by hsCRP, TNFR-1 and CCL2 (N > 146). Comparison to independent reference cohorts (N > 200) confirmed elevated risk in DKD patients with high urinary TNFR-1 and CCL2 and showed that 6-week treatment of dapagliflozin did not alter these biomarkers significantly.\n \n \n \n Taken together, inhibition of IL-33 may be beneficial in patients with DKD on standard of care, who have elevated biomarkers of inflammation such as TNFR-1 and/or CCL2. This hypothesis is currently being tested in the FRONTIER-1 phase 2b clinical study. To identify the patients most likely to benefit from immunomodulatory treatment with tozorakimab, the study will conduct a retrospective analysis of albuminuria and inflammatory biomarkers. The primary analysis of the study is planned for the second half of 2023.",

Previously, mouse IL-2 and its cognate receptor were engineered to create an orthogonal (ortho) cytokine-cytokine receptor pair capable of delivering an IL-2 signal without toxicity. Here, we engineered a human orthogonal IL-2 (ortho-hIL-2) and human orthogonal IL-2Rβ (ortho-hIL-2Rβ) pair, containing human-specific mutations. Ortho-hIL-2 is selective toward ortho-hIL-2Rβ–expressing cells with no appreciable signaling on wild-type T cells. Ortho-hIL-2 induces IL-2 receptor signaling and supports proliferation of both an IL-2–dependent cell line and primary T cells transduced to express the ortho-hIL-2Rβ. Using CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, we show that ortho-hIL-2 induces a dose-dependent increase in ortho-hIL-2Rβ+ CAR T cell expansion in vivo by as much as 1000-fold at 2 weeks after adoptive transfer into immunodeficient mice bearing CD19+ Nalm6 leukemia xenografts. Ortho-hIL-2 can rescue the antileukemic effect of an otherwise suboptimal CAR T cell dose. In addition, ortho-hIL-2 administration initiated at the time of leukemic relapse after CAR T cell therapy can rescue an otherwise failed antileukemic response. These data highlight the potential of combining an orthogonal cytokine approach with T cell–based immunotherapies to augment the antitumor efficacy of engineered T cells.",

Demographic and clinical data were captured and analysed. The National Department of Health 2019 fees schedule was used to calculate costs based on duration of ICU stay and number of haemodialysis sessions received.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 57 patients included in the study, 84% were cases of deliberate self-harm. The majority were aged <40 years (77%) and female (79%). The mean (standard deviation (SD)) initial serum theophylline level was 612 (269) µmol/L. Complications included convulsions (n=12; 21%), arrhythmias (n=9; 16%), need for mechanical ventilation (n=7; 12%) and death (n=4; 7%). The main risk factors for these complications were age ≥30 years, an inappropriately normal or elevated initial serum potassium level, an elevated serum creatinine kinase level and an elevated initial serum theophylline level. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis assessing the initial serum theophylline level as a discriminator for life-threatening complications produced an area under the curve of 0.71 for serum theophylline >400 µmol/L (sensitivity 88%, specificity 12%). All the 4 patients who died had an initial serum theophylline level >1 000 µmol/L. The mean (SD) cost per admission amounted to ZAR16 897 (10 718), with a mean of one 4-hour dialysis session per admission.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSevere theophylline toxicity, usually in the context of  deliberate self-harm, is a preventable yet life-threatening toxicity encountered at  LTH.  Demographic  risk factors include young females from certain areas in and around Gqeberha.  Risk factors for complications include older age, paradoxically normal or elevated serum potassium levels, elevated serum creatinine kinase levels and an initial serum theophylline level >400 µmol/L. Patients with these clinical features should be closely monitored and treated timeously at an appropriate level of care. The need for ICU admission and dialysis, both limited resources, makes the treatment of severe theophylline toxicity costly.

Fusion proteins are constructed by the linking of two protein domains with a peptide linker. The selection of a linker sequence is important for the construction of stable and bioactive fusion proteins. Empirically designed linkers are generally classified into two categories according to their structural features: flexible linkers and rigid linkers. Rigid linkers with the α-helix-forming sequences A(EAAAK)nA (n=2-5) were first designed about two decades ago to control the distance between two protein domains and to reduce their interference. Thereafter, the helical linkers have been applied to the construction of many fusion proteins to improve expression and bioactivity. In addition, the design of fusion proteins that self-assemble into supramolecular complexes is useful for nanobiotechnology and synthetic biology. A protein that forms a self-assembling oligomer was fused by a rigid helical linker to another protein that forms another self-assembling oligomer, and the fusion protein symmetrically self-assembled into a designed protein nanoparticle or nanomaterial. Moreover, to construct chain-like polymeric nanostructures, extender protein nanobuilding blocks were designed by tandemly fusing two dimeric de novo proteins with helical or flexible linkers. The linker design of fusion proteins can affect conformation and dynamics of self-assembling nanostructures. The present review and methods focus on useful helical linkers to construct bioactive fusion proteins and protein-based nanostructures.",

However, this capacity is accompanied by a significant risk: the capability to generate seizure discharges is also a property of all mammalian cortices. How do cortical circuits reconcile the requirement to maintain plasticity, but at the same time control seizure initiation? These issues come into particular focus in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is one of the main plasticity engines in the brain, and is also a structure frequently implicated in the generation of epileptic seizures, with temporal lobe epilepsy constituting the most prevalent form of epilepsy in the adult population. One aspect of hippocampal circuitry that is particularly prominent is its intimate interconnections with the entorhinal cortex. These interconnections create a number of excitatory synaptic loops within the limbic system, which, in addition to being important in cognitive function, can support reentrant activation and seizure generation. In the present review, using optical imaging approaches to elucidate circuit processing at high temporal and spatial resolution, we examine how two targets of entorhinal cortical input within the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus and area CA1, regulate these synaptic pathways in ways that can maintain functions important in generation of normal activity patterns, but that dampen the ability of these inputs to generate seizure discharges.",

By contrast, specificity of protein-protein interactions usually involves backbone shape complementarity1, which is less modular and hence harder to generalize. Coiled-coil heterodimers are an exception, but the restricted geometry of interactions across the heterodimer interface (primarily at the heptad a and d positions2) limits the number of orthogonal pairs that can be created simply by varying side-chain interactions3,4. Here we show that protein-protein interaction specificity can be achieved using extensive and modular side-chain hydrogen-bond networks. We used the Crick generating equations5 to produce millions of four-helix backbones with varying degrees of supercoiling around a central axis, identified those accommodating extensive hydrogen-bond networks, and used Rosetta to connect pairs of helices with short loops and to optimize the remainder of the sequence. Of 97 such designs expressed in Escherichia coli, 65 formed constitutive heterodimers, and the crystal structures of four designs were in close agreement with the computational models and confirmed the designed hydrogen-bond networks. In cells, six heterodimers were fully orthogonal, and in vitro-following mixing of 32 chains from 16 heterodimer designs, denaturation in 5 M guanidine hydrochloride and reannealing-almost all of the interactions observed by native mass spectrometry were between the designed cognate pairs.

Age-related, protective, and disease-promoting factors probably interact with the core mechanisms of the disease. Amyloid β42, and tau proteins are established core cerebrospinal biomarkers; novel candidate biomarkers include amyloid β oligomers and synaptic markers. MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose PET are established imaging techniques for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid PET is gaining traction in the clinical arena, but validity and cost-effectiveness remain to be established. Tau PET might offer new insights and be of great help in differential diagnosis and selection of patients for trials. In the search for understanding the disease mechanism and keys to treatment, research is moving increasingly into the earliest phase of disease. Preclinical Alzheimer's disease is defined as biomarker evidence of Alzheimer's pathological changes in cognitively healthy individuals. Patients with subjective cognitive decline have been identified as a useful population in whom to look for preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Moderately positive results for interventions targeting several lifestyle factors in non-demented elderly patients and moderately positive interim results for lowering amyloid in pre-dementia Alzheimer's disease suggest that, ultimately, there will be a future in which specific anti-Alzheimer's therapy will be combined with lifestyle interventions targeting general brain health to jointly combat the disease.

They have been shown to have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity toward Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as antifungal, antiprotozoan, and antiviral activity. These peptides are able to exert their activity through a variety of mechanisms that include inhibiting DNA and RNA replication, inhibiting protein synthesis, permeabilizing the cell membrane, disrupting proton and ion transmembrane gradients, and inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis. Certain antimicrobial peptides are able to utilize metals to modulate their activity through structural changes upon metal binding, metal sequestration, and redox chemistry. This work aims to provide a review of the current literature regarding the influence of metals on the activity of antimicrobial metallopeptides and their uses in drug delivery and the treatment of implant-associated infections.",

        "abstract": "Self-assembling cyclic protein homo-oligomers play important roles in biology, and the ability to generate custom homo-oligomeric structures could enable new approaches to probe biological function. Here we report a general approach to design cyclic homo-oligomers that employs a new residue-pair-transform method to assess the designability of a protein-protein interface. This method is sufficiently rapid to enable the systematic enumeration of cyclically docked arrangements of a monomer followed by sequence design of the newly formed interfaces. We use this method to design interfaces onto idealized repeat proteins that direct their assembly into complexes that possess cyclic symmetry. Of 96 designs that were characterized experimentally, 21 were found to form stable monodisperse homo-oligomers in solution, and 15 (four homodimers, six homotrimers, six homotetramers and one homopentamer) had solution small-angle X-ray scattering data consistent with the design models. X-ray crystal structures were obtained for five of the designs and each is very close to their corresponding computational model.",

Gluten is a common ingredient in daily diet and is one of the main environmental factors to induce coeliac disease. Adhering to gluten free diet (GFD) is an effective method for treating CD. Microbiota plays an extremely important role in maintaining human health, and diet is the main factor to regulate the composition and function of gut microbiota. Recent studies have shown that gluten metabolism is closely related to gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota. With the increasing prevalence of coeliac disease, there is a need for alternative treatments to GFD. In this review, biological medication of gluten, relationship between gluten and gut microflora, effect of GFD on GIT microflora, and effect of probiotics on CD were reviewed. By analysing the research progress on relationship between gluten and gastrointestinal microbiome in coeliac disease, this review tried to explore the prospective and potential mechanism of microecological agents in treating coeliac disease.",

Such peptides can have excellent pharmaceutical properties, combining the stability and tissue penetration of small-molecule drugs with the specificity of much larger protein therapeutics. The ability to design constrained peptides with precisely specified tertiary structures would enable the design of shape-complementary inhibitors of arbitrary targets. Here we describe the development of computational methods for accurate de novo design of conformationally restricted peptides, and the use of these methods to design 18-47 residue, disulfide-crosslinked peptides, a subset of which are heterochiral and/or N-C backbone-cyclized. Both genetically encodable and non-canonical peptides are exceptionally stable to thermal and chemical denaturation, and 12 experimentally determined X-ray and NMR structures are nearly identical to the computational design models. The computational design methods and stable scaffolds presented here provide the basis for development of a new generation of peptide-based drugs.",

It was intended to identify safety measures to reduce virus spread and develop community-informed public health messaging to promote COVID-19 risk-reduction strategies within campus communities. This study was approved by the institutional review board where the study took place. A total of 113 stakeholders, including students, staff, and faculty attended one of nine focus groups. We use the socioecological model to illustrate the use of COVID-19 public health measures in private and public spaces and how macro-level processes, specifically sociocultural values of personal freedom and social responsibility shape the meaning and interpretation of COVID-19 public health measures. A rapid qualitative data analysis was conducted. This analysis was characterized by three steps: (1) transcription of the interviews, (2) completion of a summary template per focus group analysis (data reduction strategy), and (3) matrix analyses involving a cross-case analysis of the nine focus groups conducted. Based on study findings, we offer community-centered recommendations for safe and healthy reopening of large public research institutions. This article contributes to the foundation of scientific literature that qualitatively describes evidence-based strategies for safe reopening of places of education and employment in the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "title": "The OCT2 Transporter Regulates Dopamine D1 Receptor Signaling at the Golgi Apparatus",
        "abstract": "Dopamine is a key catecholamine in the brain and kidney, where it is involved in a number of physiological functions such as locomotion, cognition, emotion, endocrine regulation, and renal function. As a membrane-impermeant hormone and neurotransmitter, dopamine is thought to signal by binding and activating dopamine receptors, members of the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family, only on the plasma membrane. Here, using novel nanobody-based biosensors, we demonstrate for the first time that the dopamine D1 receptor (D1DR), the primary mediator of dopaminergic signaling in the brain and kidney, not only functions on the plasma membrane but becomes activated at the Golgi apparatus in the presence of its ligand. We present evidence that activation of the Golgi pool of D1DR is dependent on organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), a dopamine transporter, providing an explanation for how the membrane-impermeant dopamine accesses subcellular pools of D1DR. We further demonstrate that dopamine activates Golgi-D1DR in murine striatal medium spiny neurons, and this activity depends on OCT2 function. We also introduce a new approach to selectively interrogate compartmentalized D1DR signaling by inhibiting Gαs coupling using a nanobody-based chemical recruitment system. Using this strategy, we show that Golgi-localized D1DRs regulate cAMP production and mediate local protein kinase A activation. Together, our data suggest that spatially compartmentalized signaling hubs are previously unappreciated regulatory aspects of D1DR signaling. Our data provide further evidence for the role of transporters in regulating subcellular GPCR activity.",

        "abstract": "The ability of naturally occurring proteins to change conformation in response to environmental changes is critical to biological function. Although there have been advances in the de novo design of stable proteins with a single, deep free-energy minimum, the design of conformational switches remains challenging. We present a general strategy to design pH-responsive protein conformational changes by precisely preorganizing histidine residues in buried hydrogen-bond networks. We design homotrimers and heterodimers that are stable above pH 6.5 but undergo cooperative, large-scale conformational changes when the pH is lowered and electrostatic and steric repulsion builds up as the network histidine residues become protonated. The transition pH and cooperativity can be controlled through the number of histidine-containing networks and the strength of the surrounding hydrophobic interactions. Upon disassembly, the designed proteins disrupt lipid membranes both in vitro and after being endocytosed in mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that environmentally triggered conformational changes can now be programmed by de novo protein design.",

We have investigated genetic diversity and antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli isolates from a range of non-human primates dispersed across the Gambia: patas monkey (n=1), western colobus monkey (n=6), green monkey (n=14) and guinea baboon (n=22). From 43 stools, we recovered 99 isolates. We performed Illumina whole-genome shotgun sequencing on all isolates and nanopore long-read sequencing on isolates with antimicrobial resistance genes. We inferred the evolution of E. coli in this population using the EnteroBase software environment. We identified 43 sequence types (ten of them novel), spanning five of the eight known phylogroups of E. coli. Many of the observed sequence types and phylotypes from non-human primates have been associated with human extra-intestinal infection and carry virulence characteristics associated with disease in humans, particularly ST73, ST217 and ST681. However, we found a low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes in isolates from non-human primates. Hierarchical clustering showed that ST442 and ST349 from non-human primates are closely related to isolates from human infections, suggesting recent exchange of bacteria between humans and monkeys. Our results are of public health importance, considering the increasing contact between humans and wild primates.",

In this issue of EMBO Reports, Park et al [1] identify the phosphatase wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1) as a negative regulator of TGF-β family signaling. Mechanistically, Wip1 constrains TGF-β family signaling through direct dephosphorylation of Thr277, an activating MAP kinase phosphorylation site located in the linker region of the common mediator Smad4.",

        "abstract": "ch sequencing effort has focused on key mammalian model organisms such as mouse and human, little is known about the correlation between genome sequencing techniques for non-model mammals and genome assembly quality. This is especially relevant to non-model mammals, where the samples to be sequenced are often degraded and low quality. A key aspect when planning a genome project is the choice of sequencing data to generate. This decision is driven by several factors, including the biological questions being asked, the quality of DNA available, and the availability of funds. Cutting-edge sequencing technologies now make it possible to achieve highly contiguous, chromosome-level genome assemblies, but relies on good quality high-molecular-weight DNA. Here we use a range of different genomic technologies generated from a roadkill European Polecat (Mustela putorius) to assess various assembly techniques on this low-quality sample. We evaluated different approaches for de novo assemblies and discuss their value in relation to biological analyses. The high degree of variability between each de novo assembly method (assessed from the seven key metrics) highlights the importance of carefully devising the sequencing strategy to be able to carry out the desired analysis. Adding more data to genome assemblies does not always results in better assemblies so it is important to understand the nuances of genomic data integration explained here, in order to obtain cost-effective value-for-money when sequencing genomes.

South Africa, given the condition of its healthcare system, is particularly vulnerable. There has been much discussion around rational healthcare utilisation, ranging from diagnostic testing and personal protective equipment to triage and appropriate use of ventilation strategies. There has, however, been little guidance around use of laboratory tests once COVID-19 positive patients have been admitted to hospital. We present a working guide to rational laboratory test use, specifically for COVID-19, among hospitalised patients, including the critically ill. The specific tests, the reasons for testing, their clinical usefulness, timing and frequency are addressed.

Urticaria is a frequent, mast cell-driven disease, presenting with wheals, angioedema, or both. The life-time prevalence for acute urticaria is approximately 20%. Chronic spontaneous urticaria and other chronic forms of urticaria do not only cause a decrease in quality of life, but also affect performance at work and school and, as such, are members of the group of severe allergic diseases. This guideline covers the definition and classification of urticaria, taking into account the recent progress in identifying its causes, eliciting factors and pathomechanisms. In addition, it outlines evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the different subtypes of urticaria. This guideline was acknowledged and accepted by the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS).",

This is a retrospective comparative study from 2007 to 2016 at a single tertiary care center. A consecutive sample of patients undergoing surgery for aging of the upper face was included in the study. Surgeries deemed to be inclusive were endoscopic browlift, upper blepharoplasty, and lower blepharoplasty. In total, 46 patients undergoing endoscopic browlift with concurrent blepharoplasty were included. Patient demographics, past medical history, follow-up, and any complications related to their surgery were studied up to 90 months postoperatively. Combination of endoscopic browlift with blepharoplasty did not increase the risk of complications on univariate analysis (p = 0.735). There were no differences in complication rates on univariate analysis of patients with a smoking history, diabetes, or autoimmune disease (p = 0.111, p = 0.575, p > 0.999, respectively). Furthermore, there was no difference between groups in complication rates, smoking history, diabetes, or autoimmune disease (p = 0.735, p = 0.181, p = 0.310, p = 0.218, respectively). Smoking had an insignificant increased risk of complication as compared with nonsmokers on multivariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] = 4.526; p = 0.073). Increasing age was slightly associated with fewer complications on multivariate analysis in this patient cohort (OR = 0.939; p = 0.048). By combining endoscopic browlift with a concomitant blepharoplasty, the goals of the patient and the standards of the surgeon can be effectively and safely achieved. Analysis of complications from 46 combined cases at our institution asserts that this is a safe operation. Smoking status was the only observed predictor for postoperative complications. This was a level of evidence 3, retrospective comparative study.",

        "abstract": "Rational vaccine development and evaluation requires identifying and measuring the magnitude of epitope-specific CD8 T cell responses. However, conventional CD8 T cell epitope discovery methods are labor intensive and do not scale well. In this study, we accelerate this process by using an ultradense peptide array as a high-throughput tool for screening peptides to identify putative novel epitopes. In a single experiment, we directly assess the binding of four common Indian rhesus macaque MHC class I molecules (Mamu-A1*001, -A1*002, -B*008, and -B*017) to ∼61,000 8-mer, 9-mer, and 10-mer peptides derived from the full proteomes of 82 SIV and simian HIV isolates. Many epitope-specific CD8 T cell responses restricted by these four MHC molecules have already been identified in SIVmac239, providing an ideal dataset for validating the array; up to 64% of these known epitopes are found in the top 192 SIVmac239 peptides with the most intense MHC binding signals in our experiment. To assess whether the peptide array identified putative novel CD8 T cell epitopes, we validated the method by IFN-γ ELISPOT assay and found three novel peptides that induced CD8 T cell responses in at least two Mamu-A1*001-positive animals; two of these were validated by ex vivo tetramer staining. This high-throughput identification of peptides that bind class I MHC will enable more efficient CD8 T cell response profiling for vaccine development, particularly for pathogens with complex proteomes for which few epitope-specific responses have been defined.",

        "abstract": "fungi are fundamental to the human microbiome, the diversity and dynamics of the mycobiome is poorly understood, particularly in considering their association with infectious disease, autoimmune disorders and atopy that affect immunocompromised individuals and infants. Characterising the human mycobiome faces several challenges relating to their low abundance and lack of standardized procedures for sample collection and isolation of viable cells and/or quality genetic material for culture-dependent and independent taxonomic and functional characterisation. To address these issues, we have developed a mycobiome analysis pipeline employing both culture-dependent and independent methods to identify as well as isolate, where possible, the fungal taxa populating the human intestinal tract. In a proof-of-concept study this pipeline has been used to identify fungal populations in faecal samples obtained from a small cohort of young infants, aged 2 years or younger. All were born prematurely, and severely immunocompromised and at risk from invasive and potentially lethal microbial infections, including those caused by fungal overgrowth. We have used this combined approach successfully to identify the fungi present in each individual infant, and to recover viable isolates. To date, Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis are the most frequently isolated fungi. While both are major opportunistic human fungal pathogens, C. parapsilosis is particularly problematic to preterm babies, due to its innate ability to form biofilms. Detailed characterisation of these isolates is currently underway. Two large-scale longitudinal microbiome studies have started at the Quadram Institute, and our validated analysis pipeline will be incorporated to define the fungal component of each study participant.",

Here we used single-nucleus transcriptomics to examine ~80,000 nuclei from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of male individuals with MDD (n = 17) and of healthy controls (n = 17). We identified 26 cellular clusters, and over 60% of these showed differential gene expression between groups. We found that the greatest dysregulation occurred in deep layer excitatory neurons and immature oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and these contributed almost half (47%) of all changes in gene expression. These results highlight the importance of dissecting cell-type-specific contributions to the disease and offer opportunities to identify new avenues of research and novel targets for treatment.",

Such peptides can have excellent pharmaceutical properties, combining the stability and tissue penetration of small-molecule drugs with the specificity of much larger protein therapeutics. The ability to design constrained peptides with precisely specified tertiary structures would enable the design of shape-complementary inhibitors of arbitrary targets. Here we describe the development of computational methods for accurate de novo design of conformationally restricted peptides, and the use of these methods to design 18-47 residue, disulfide-crosslinked peptides, a subset of which are heterochiral and/or N-C backbone-cyclized. Both genetically encodable and non-canonical peptides are exceptionally stable to thermal and chemical denaturation, and 12 experimentally determined X-ray and NMR structures are nearly identical to the computational design models. The computational design methods and stable scaffolds presented here provide the basis for development of a new generation of peptide-based drugs.",

        "abstract": "The ability to design proteins with high affinity and selectivity for any given small molecule is a rigorous test of our understanding of the physiochemical principles that govern molecular recognition. Attempts to rationally design ligand-binding proteins have met with little success, however, and the computational design of protein-small-molecule interfaces remains an unsolved problem. Current approaches for designing ligand-binding proteins for medical and biotechnological uses rely on raising antibodies against a target antigen in immunized animals and/or performing laboratory-directed evolution of proteins with an existing low affinity for the desired ligand, neither of which allows complete control over the interactions involved in binding. Here we describe a general computational method for designing pre-organized and shape complementary small-molecule-binding sites, and use it to generate protein binders to the steroid digoxigenin (DIG). Of seventeen experimentally characterized designs, two bind DIG; the model of the higher affinity binder has the most energetically favourable and pre-organized interface in the design set. A comprehensive binding-fitness landscape of this design, generated by library selections and deep sequencing, was used to optimize its binding affinity to a picomolar level, and X-ray co-crystal structures of two variants show atomic-level agreement with the corresponding computational models. The optimized binder is selective for DIG over the related steroids digitoxigenin, progesterone and β-oestradiol, and this steroid binding preference can be reprogrammed by manipulation of explicitly designed hydrogen-bonding interactions. The computational design method presented here should enable the development of a new generation of biosensors, therapeutics and diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "Growing bodies of evidence have demonstrated that the identification of prostate cancer (PCa) biomarkers in the patients' blood and urine may remarkably improve PCa diagnosis and progression monitoring. Among diverse cancer-derived circulating materials, extracellular RNA molecules (exRNAs) represent a compelling component to investigate cancer-related alterations. Once outside the intracellular environment, exRNAs circulate in biofluids either in association with protein complexes or encapsulated inside extracellular vesicles (EVs). Notably, EV-associated RNAs (EV-RNAs) were used for the development of several assays (such as the FDA-approved Progensa Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 (PCA3 test) aiming at improving early PCa detection. EV-RNAs encompass a mixture of species, including small non-coding RNAs (e.g. miRNA and circRNA), lncRNAs and mRNAs. Several methods have been proposed to isolate EVs and relevant RNAs, and to perform RNA-Seq studies to identify potential cancer biomarkers. However, EVs in the circulation of a cancer patient include a multitude of diverse populations that are released by both cancer and normal cells from different tissues, thereby leading to a heterogeneous EV-RNA-associated transcriptional signal. Decrypting the complexity of such a composite signal is nowadays the major challenge faced in the identification of specific tumor-associated RNAs. Multiple deconvolution algorithms have been proposed so far to infer the enrichment of cancer-specific signals from gene expression data. However, novel strategies for EVs sorting and sequencing of RNA associated to single EVs populations will remarkably facilitate the identification of cancer-related molecules. Altogether, the studies summarized here demonstrate the high potential of using EV-RNA biomarkers in PCa and highlight the urgent need of improving technologies and computational approaches to characterize specific EVs populations and their relevant RNA cargo.",

        "title": "A high-affinity Optide (optimized peptide) inhibitor of the Hippo pathway’s YAP-TEAD interaction",
        "abstract": "pathway plays a critical role in contact inhibition, a pathway that is commonly dysregulated in many human cancers (including liver, colon, ovarian, and lung). The signaling pathway culminates in the intranuclear interaction of the transcriptional co-activator YAP and the transcription factor TEAD. This is representative of a number of cancer driving pathways that have proven nearly impossible to drug, as they are mediated by intracellular protein-protein interactions. High throughput screening campaigns with small molecule libraries have failed to provide specific, high affinity binders capable of disrupting larger protein-protein interfaces (such as YAP-TEAD), while at the same time, antibodies cannot penetrate the cell membrane to access cytosolic and nuclear targets. Optides are small disulfide-knotted peptides (knottins) that are large enough to interfere with protein-protein interactions, but small enough to access compartments beyond the reach of antibodies. Examples include the calcines, activators of sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptors, and BLZ-100, a knottin-fluorophore conjugate that is capable of accumulating in a wide range of tumor types. Using the computational design software Rosetta, we created a library of Optides designed to interact with TEAD in locations that overlap YAP binding. Mammalian surface display screening against soluble TEAD yielded a candidate (Hit1) that binds TEAD with nanomolar affinity and inhibits YAP binding. Affinity maturation, using site saturation mutagenesis, produced an improved sub-nanomolar variant (IV1) with potent YAP inhibition. This variant was also found to be highly resistant to reduction and proteolysis, crucial for a disulfide-knotted peptide with a cytosolic target in the proteinase-rich tumor milieu. With this highly potent YAP inhibitor, efforts are now focused on cell penetration and biodistribution with the long-term goal of advancing a clinical development candidate.

        "abstract": "While the cost of DNA sequencing has dropped by five orders of magnitude in the past decade, DNA synthesis remains expensive for many applications. Although DNA microarrays have decreased the cost of oligonucleotide synthesis, the use of array-synthesized oligos in practice is limited by short synthesis lengths, high synthesis error rates, low yield and the challenges of assembling long constructs from complex pools. Toward addressing these issues, we developed a protocol for multiplex pairwise assembly of oligos from array-synthesized oligonucleotide pools. To evaluate the method, we attempted to assemble up to 2271 targets ranging in length from 192-252 bases using pairs of array-synthesized oligos. Within sets of complexity ranging from 131-250 targets, we observed error-free assemblies for 90.5% of all targets. When all 2271 targets were assembled in one reaction, we observed error-free constructs for 70.6%. While the assembly method intrinsically increased accuracy to a small degree, we further increased accuracy by using a high throughput 'Dial-Out PCR' protocol, which combines Illumina sequencing with an in-house set of unique PCR tags to selectively amplify perfect assemblies from complex synthetic pools. This approach has broad applicability to DNA assembly and high-throughput functional screens.",

In this report, we examine the historical development and components of the Brazilian health system, focusing on the reform process during the past 40 years, including the creation of the Unified Health System. A defining characteristic of the contemporary health sector reform in Brazil is that it was driven by civil society rather than by governments, political parties, or international organisations. The advent of the Unified Health System increased access to health care for a substantial proportion of the Brazilian population, at a time when the system was becoming increasingly privatised. Much is still to be done if universal health care is to be achieved. Over the past 20 years, there have been other advances, including investments in human resources, science and technology, and primary care, and a substantial decentralisation process, widespread social participation, and growing public awareness of a right to health care. If the Brazilian health system is to overcome the challenges with which it is presently faced, strengthened political support is needed so that financing can be restructured and the roles of both the public and private sector can be redefined.",

Detrimental effects of stigma included both physical health, including effective management of the condition, and psychological wellbeing, including difficulties such as depression and anxiety. These findings suggested that culturally-informed educational initiatives and therapeutic interventions which aim to address stigma in people with epilepsy (PWE) are needed. Section 2 describes a research study examining the extent to which self-compassion can predict depression, anxiety, and resilience in PWE, when controlling for other important demographic and illness-related variables. Adults with epilepsy were invited to take part in a survey either online or in epilepsy or neurology clinics. Data were then analysed using hierarchical multiple regression models. In this sample of PWE, self-compassion was found to significantly predict lower depression and anxiety and higher resilience when other significant sociodemographic and illness-related variables had been taken into account. These findings indicated that self-compassion is an important factor in determining psychological outcomes for PWE, providing preliminary support for the use of compassionfocused approaches in this population. Section 3 provides a critical appraisal of the thesis. This includes a summary of the main findings; a discussion of some of the key decisions, challenges, and professional issues identified during the research process; a consideration of potential future research arising from the findings; and personal reflections on the process of undertaking the work.",

        "abstract": "The Lancet Countdown is an international, multidisciplinary collaboration, dedicated to monitoring the evolving health profile of climate change, and providing an independent assessment of the delivery of commitments made by governments worldwide under the Paris Agreement. The 2019 report presents an annual update of 41 indicators across five key domains: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability; adaptation, planning, and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. The report represents the findings and consensus of 35 leading academic institutions and UN agencies from every continent. Each year, the methods and data that underpin the Lancet Countdown’s indicators are further developed and improved, with updates described at each stage of this report. The collaboration draws on the world-class expertise of climate scientists; ecologists; mathematicians; engineers; energy, food, and transport experts; economists; social and political scientists; public health professionals; and doctors, to generate the quality and diversity of data required. The science of climate change describes a range of possible futures, which are largely dependent on the degree of action or inaction in the face of a warming world. The policies implemented will have far-reaching effects in determining these eventualities, with the indicators tracked here monitoring both the present-day effects of climate change, as well as the worldwide response. Understanding these decisions as a choice between one of two pathways—one that continues with the business as usual response and one that redirects to a future that remains “well below 2°C”—helps to bring the importance of recognising the effects of climate change and the necessary response to the forefront. Evidence provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the International Energy Agency, and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration clarifies the degree and magnitude of climate change experienced today and contextualises these two pathways.",

        "title": "Optides (optimized knottin peptides) computationally designed to target the oncogenic HIPPO pathway",
        "abstract": "pathway plays a critical role in contact inhibition, a pathway that is commonly dysregulated in many human cancers (including liver, colon, ovarian, and lung) and which relies on the intranuclear interaction of the transcriptional coactivator YAP and the transcription factor TEAD(1-4). This pathway also plays a crucial role in recovery from injury; for example, its regulated repression allows hepatocytes to divide and replace tissue lost to a partial hepatectomy, after which its activation suppresses cell growth and prevents tissue overgrowth. While small molecule enzyme inhibitors have proven to be a revelation in cancer therapy, cell growth signaling via protein-protein interactions has proven much more difficult to drug. While Antibodies can be effective in targeting extracellular or cell surface epitopes, intracellular targets, such as the interaction between YAP and TEAD, are not amenable to antibody-based therapeutics. Optides are small disulfide-knotted peptides (knottins) and serve to bridge these capabilities; they are large enough to interfere with protein-protein interactions, but small enough to penetrate into the cytosol. Examples include imperatoxin, an activator of mitochondrial ryanodine receptors, and Tumor Paint, which contains an optimized variant of chlorotoxin conjugated to a fluorescent probe and is capable of accumulating in a wide range of tumor types. To test whether Optides can abrogate oncogenic signaling mediated by protein-protein interactions, we created libraries of computationally designed candidates to target the TEAD/YAP interface. The library is expressed on the surface of mammalian cells, chosen for the improved fidelity of disulfide bridge connectivity observed in the mammalian secretory pathway as compared to that found in yeast. By repetitive screening against soluble TEAD protein, we are optimizing the pool of candidates for targeting TEAD. The lead Optides will be characterized for their ability to reduce YAP-TEAD interaction, and to impair YAP-mediated cell growth. Owing to the wide variety of knottin scaffolds, both natural and in silico designed, this flexible technology could be applied to other targets in order to impair oncogenic protein-protein interactions.

        "abstract": "Influenza is an infectious respiratory disease that, in humans, is caused by influenza A and influenza B viruses. Typically characterized by annual seasonal epidemics, sporadic pandemic outbreaks involve influenza A virus strains of zoonotic origin. The WHO estimates that annual epidemics of influenza result in ~1 billion infections, 3–5 million cases of severe illness and 300,000–500,000 deaths. The severity of pandemic influenza depends on multiple factors, including the virulence of the pandemic virus strain and the level of pre-existing immunity. The most severe influenza pandemic, in 1918, resulted in >40 million deaths worldwide. Influenza vaccines are formulated every year to match the circulating strains, as they evolve antigenically owing to antigenic drift. Nevertheless, vaccine efficacy is not optimal and is dramatically low in the case of an antigenic mismatch between the vaccine and the circulating virus strain. Antiviral agents that target the influenza virus enzyme neuraminidase have been developed for prophylaxis and therapy. However, the use of these antivirals is still limited. Emerging approaches to combat influenza include the development of universal influenza virus vaccines that provide protection against antigenically distant influenza viruses, but these vaccines need to be tested in clinical trials to ascertain their effectiveness.",

Microbiota plays an extremely important role in maintaining human health, and diet is the main factor to regulate the composition and function of gut microbiota. Recent studies have shown that gluten metabolism is closely related to gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota. With the increasing prevalence of coeliac disease, there is a need for alternative treatments to GFD. In this review, biological medication of gluten, relationship between gluten and gut microflora, effect of GFD on GIT microflora, and effect of probiotics on CD were reviewed. By analysing the research progress on relationship between gluten and gastrointestinal microbiome in coeliac disease, this review tried to explore the prospective and potential mechanism of microecological agents in treating coeliac disease.",

To this end, genetic code expansion methodology holds particular promise, as it allows the site-selective introduction of new functional elements into proteins as noncanonical amino acid side chains1-4. Here we exploit an expanded genetic code to develop a photoenzyme that operates by means of triplet energy transfer (EnT) catalysis, a versatile mode of reactivity in organic synthesis that is not accessible to biocatalysis at present5-12. Installation of a genetically encoded photosensitizer into the beta-propeller scaffold of DA_20_00 (ref. 13) converts a de novo Diels-Alderase into a photoenzyme for [2+2] cycloadditions (EnT1.0). Subsequent development and implementation of a platform for photoenzyme evolution afforded an efficient and enantioselective enzyme (EnT1.3, up to 99% enantiomeric excess (e.e.)) that can promote intramolecular and bimolecular cycloadditions, including transformations that have proved challenging to achieve selectively with small-molecule catalysts. EnT1.3 performs >300 turnovers and, in contrast to small-molecule photocatalysts, can operate effectively under aerobic conditions and at ambient temperatures. An X-ray crystal structure of an EnT1.3-product complex shows how multiple functional components work in synergy to promote efficient and selective photocatalysis. This study opens up a wealth of new excited-state chemistry in protein active sites and establishes the framework for developing a new generation of enantioselective photocatalysts.",

The species is 12 fixed inversions removed from the standard sequence of the subgenus Simulium. Three of these fixed inversions, 38 autosomal polymorphisms, and a complex set of 12 X and 6 Y chromosomes in 29 zygotic combinations uniquely characterize S. colombaschense and reveal 5 cytoforms: 'A' in the Danube watershed, 'B' in Italy's Adige River, 'C' in the Aliakmonas River of Greece, 'D' in the Aoös drainage in Greece, and 'E' in the Belá River of Slovakia. 'C' and 'D' are reproductively isolated from one another, and 'B' is considered a cytotype of 'A,' the probable name bearer of colombaschense. The species status of 'E' cannot be determined without additional collections. Three derived polytene sequences, based on outgroup comparisons, place S. colombaschense in a clade of species composed of the S. jenningsi, S. malyschevi, and S. reptans species groups. Only cytoforms 'A' and 'B' are pests. Within the Simuliidae, pest status is reached through one of two principal pathways, both of which promote the production of large populations of blood-seeking flies: (1) colonization of the world's largest rivers (habitat specialization) or (2) colonization of multiple habitat types (habitat generalization). Evolutionary acquisition of the ability to colonize large rivers by an ancestor of the S. jenningsi-malyschevi-reptans clade set the scene for the pest status of S. colombaschense and other big-river members of the clade. In an ironic twist, the macrogenome of S. colombaschense reveals that the name associated with history's worst simuliid pest represents a complex of species, two or more of which are nonpests potentially vulnerable to loss of their limited habitat.",

The elevated iron levels observed in the substantia nigra of PD subjects have been suggested to incite the generation of reactive oxygen species and intracellular α-synuclein aggregation, terminating in the oxidative neuronal destruction of this brain area. Thus, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in iron dysregulation and oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration is a crucial step in deciphering PD pathology and in developing novel iron-complexing compounds aimed at restoring brain iron homeostasis and attenuating neurodegeneration. This review discusses the involvement of dysregulation of brain iron homeostasis in PD pathology, with an emphasis on the potential effectiveness of naturally occurring compounds and novel iron-chelating/antioxidant therapeutic hybrid molecules, exerting a spectrum of neuroprotective interrelated activities: antioxidant/monoamine oxidase inhibition, activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 signaling pathway, induction of HIF-1 target iron-regulatory and antioxidative genes, and inhibition of α-synuclein accumulation and aggregation.",

        "abstract": "Despite major achievements in child survival, the burden of neonatal mortality has remained high and even increased in some countries since 1990. Currently, most neonatal deaths are attributable to being born preterm, small for gestational age (SGA), or with low birthweight (LBW). Besides neonatal mortality, these conditions are associated with stillbirth and multiple morbidities, with short-term and long-term adverse consequences for the newborn, their families, and society, resulting in a major loss of human capital. Prevention of preterm birth, SGA, and LBW is thus critical for global child health and broader societal development. Progress has, however, been slow, largely because of the global community's failure to agree on the definition and magnitude of newborn vulnerability and best ways to address it, to frame the problem attractively, and to build a broad coalition of actors and a suitable governance structure to implement a change. We propose a new definition and a conceptual framework, bringing preterm birth, SGA, and LBW together under a broader umbrella term of the small vulnerable newborn (SVN). Adoption of the framework and the unified definition can facilitate improved problem definition and improved programming for SVN prevention. Interventions aiming at SVN prevention would result in a healthier start for live-born infants, while also reducing the number of stillbirths, improving maternal health, and contributing to a positive economic and social development in the society.",

However, the very beginnings of bioinformatics occurred more than 50 years ago, when desktop computers were still a hypothesis and DNA could not yet be sequenced. The foundations of bioinformatics were laid in the early 1960s with the application of computational methods to protein sequence analysis (notably, de novo sequence assembly, biological sequence databases and substitution models). Later on, DNA analysis also emerged due to parallel advances in (i) molecular biology methods, which allowed easier manipulation of DNA, as well as its sequencing, and (ii) computer science, which saw the rise of increasingly miniaturized and more powerful computers, as well as novel software better suited to handle bioinformatics tasks. In the 1990s through the 2000s, major improvements in sequencing technology, along with reduced costs, gave rise to an exponential increase of data. The arrival of 'Big Data' has laid out new challenges in terms of data mining and management, calling for more expertise from computer science into the field. Coupled with an ever-increasing amount of bioinformatics tools, biological Big Data had (and continues to have) profound implications on the predictive power and reproducibility of bioinformatics results. To overcome this issue, universities are now fully integrating this discipline into the curriculum of biology students. Recent subdisciplines such as synthetic biology, systems biology and whole-cell modeling have emerged from the ever-increasing complementarity between computer science and biology.",

While concession cards constitute an important means of accessing support, their efficacy is dependent upon cardholders using their cards. There are many questions relating to the determinants of card use and the realised value of these benefits. For example, are decisions about when and how to use cards influenced by people’s experiences of stigma, their perceptions of the benefits received or their awareness of the concessions available? The purpose of this paper is to take a closer look at the role of stigma in discouraging card use and the value of benefits people may be forgoing.In order to do this, an online survey was conducted that asked concession cardholders about rates of card use and reasons for use or non-use, their awareness of available concession benefits and the estimated value of the benefits received. This paper confirms previous research findings that a lack of awareness is an important factor influencing people’s access to benefits to which they are entitled. However, irrespective of awareness levels, there are those who consciously choose not to use their cards because of the stigma they feel society directs at concession card holders. The paper also finds that cardholders are realising only half of the potential savings available to them.",

We constructed high-resolution structural models of resting, intermediate, and activated states of the voltage-sensing domain of the bacterial sodium channel NaChBac using the Rosetta modeling method, crystal structures of related channels, and experimental data showing state-dependent interactions between the gating charge-carrying arginines in the S4 segment and negatively charged residues in neighboring transmembrane segments. The resulting structural models illustrate a network of ionic and hydrogen-bonding interactions that are made sequentially by the gating charges as they move out under the influence of the electric field. The S4 segment slides 6-8 Å outward through a narrow groove formed by the S1, S2, and S3 segments, rotates ∼30°, and tilts sideways at a pivot point formed by a highly conserved hydrophobic region near the middle of the voltage sensor. The S4 segment has a 3(10)-helical conformation in the narrow inner gating pore, which allows linear movement of the gating charges across the inner one-half of the membrane. Conformational changes of the intracellular one-half of S4 during activation are rigidly coupled to lateral movement of the S4-S5 linker, which could induce movement of the S5 and S6 segments and open the intracellular gate of the pore. We confirmed the validity of these structural models by comparing with a high-resolution structure of a NaChBac homolog and showing predicted molecular interactions of hydrophobic residues in the S4 segment in disulfide-locking studies.",

Significant progress has been made in understanding structure and function of the voltage-gated ion channels, highlighted by the high-resolution open-state structure of the voltage-gated potassium channel, K(v)1.2. However, because the structure of the closed state is unknown, the gating mechanism remains controversial. We adapted the rosetta membrane method to model the structures of the K(v)1.2 and KvAP channels using homology, de novo, and domain assembly methods and selected the most plausible models using a limited number of experimental constraints. Our model of K(v)1.2 in the open state is very similar in overall topology to the x-ray structure of this channel. Modeling of KvAP in the open state suggests that orientation of the voltage-sensing domain relative to the pore-forming domain is considerably different from the orientation in the K(v)1.2 open state and that the magnitude of the vertical movement of S4 is significantly greater. Structural modeling of closed state of K(v)1.2 suggests gating movement that can be viewed as a sum of two previously suggested mechanisms: translation (2-4 A) plus rotation ( approximately 180 degrees ) of the S4 segment as proposed in the original \"sliding helix\" or \"helical screw\" models coupled with a rolling motion of the S1-S3 segments around S4, similar to recent \"transporter\" models of gating. We propose a unified mechanism of voltage-dependent gating for K(v)1.2 and KvAP in which this major conformational change moves the gating charge across the electric field in an analogous way for both channels.",

Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of procapsid, empty procapsid, empty mature capsid, and mature capsid of phage P22 at resolutions of 2.6 Å, 3.9 Å, 2.8 Å, and 3.0 Å, respectively. The structure of the procapsid allowed us to build an accurate model of the coat protein gp5 and the C-terminal region of the scaffolding protein gp8. In addition, interactions among the gp5 subunits responsible for procapsid assembly and stabilization were identified. Two C-terminal α-helices of gp8 were observed to interact with the coat protein in the procapsid. The amino acid interactions between gp5 and gp8 in the procapsid were consistent with the results of previous biochemical studies involving mutant proteins. Our structures reveal hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between the gp5 subunits in the procapsid and the conformational changes of the gp5 domains involved in the closure of the local sixfold opening and a thinner capsid shell during capsid maturation.",

Mice with CB1 deficiency (CB1(-/-)) had increased peak bone mass due to reduced bone resorption, but developed age-related osteoporosis with reduced bone formation and accumulation of adipocytes in the bone marrow space. Marrow stromal cells from CB1(-/-) mice had an enhanced capacity for adipocyte differentiation, a reduced capacity for osteoblast differentiation, and increased expression of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) and PPARgamma. Pharmacological blockade of CB1 receptors stimulated adipocyte differentiation, inhibited osteoblast differentiation, and increased cAMP and pCREB in osteoblast and adipocyte precursors. The CB1 receptor is therefore unique in that it regulates peak bone mass through an effect on osteoclast activity, but protects against age-related bone loss by regulating adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells.",

        "abstract": "Efforts in structural biology have targeted the systematic determination of all protein structures through experimental determination or modeling. In recent years, 3-D electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) has assumed an increasingly important role in determining the structures of these large macromolecular assemblies to intermediate resolutions (6-10 A). While these structures provide a snapshot of the assembly and its components in well-defined functional states, the resolution limits the ability to build accurate structural models. In contrast, sequence-based modeling techniques are capable of producing relatively robust structural models for isolated proteins or domains. In this work, we developed and applied a hybrid modeling approach, utilizing cryoEM density and ab initio modeling to produce a structural model for the core domain of a herpesvirus structural protein, VP26. Specifically, this method, first tested on simulated data, utilizes the cryoEM density map as a geometrical constraint in identifying the most native-like models from a gallery of models generated by ab initio modeling. The resulting model for the core domain of VP26, based on the 8.5-A resolution herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) capsid cryoEM structure and mutational data, exhibited a novel fold. Additionally, the core domain of VP26 appeared to have a complementary interface to the known upper-domain structure of VP5, its cognate binding partner. While this new model provides for a better understanding of the assembly and interactions of VP26 in HSV-1, the approach itself may have broader applications in modeling the components of large macromolecular assemblies.",

When a protein is tagged by fusion to a fluorescent protein, interactions between fluorescent proteins can undesirably disturb targeting or function. Unfortunately, all wild-type yellow-to-red fluorescent proteins reported so far are obligately tetrameric and often toxic or disruptive. The first true monomer was mRFP1, derived from the Discosoma sp. fluorescent protein \"DsRed\" by directed evolution first to increase the speed of maturation, then to break each subunit interface while restoring fluorescence, which cumulatively required 33 substitutions. Although mRFP1 has already proven widely useful, several properties could bear improvement and more colors would be welcome. We report the next generation of monomers. The latest red version matures more completely, is more tolerant of N-terminal fusions and is over tenfold more photostable than mRFP1. Three monomers with distinguishable hues from yellow-orange to red-orange have higher quantum efficiencies.",

We investigated two different phantoms composed of commonly used metals with a known chemical composition. Two rectangular phantoms consisted of water-equivalent environment material with a 65 mm thickness surrounding the 2, 5, 10 and 15 mm inserts of grade-2 and grade-5 Titanium. Track-etched detectors (TEDs) were placed behind the phantoms to gather the data. The measured LET spectra behind the implants were compared with Monte Carlo simulations using the Geant4 toolkit, version 10.03.p01. The simulations were used to provide additional information regarding the contribution of each type of particles to the LET spectra (protons, alpha particles, deuteron, neutrons, photons, and electrons) and to estimate the LET spectra above the TED's detection threshold. We used two different beam energies to study the most pertinent irradiation scenarios, one in the Bragg curve plateau and one at the maximum. The measurement of the LET spectra behind phantoms irradiated with a proton beam in the plateau region of the Bragg curve led to the detection of numerous particles with a very high LET. Lateral dose enhancement at the border between implants and the plastic material was detected when the phantoms were exposed to a proton beam and the data were recorded in the Bragg peak maximum. In this area, the dose increased 13 times for grade-2 Ti and 12 times for grade-5 Ti. The performed experimental study highlights the effect of dental implants on the LET spectra and absorbed dose when a proton pencil beam is crossing high-density titanium.",

        "abstract": "Protein structure prediction is a way to bridge the sequence-structure gap, one of the main challenges in computational biology and chemistry. Predicting any protein's accurate structure is of paramount importance for the scientific community, as these structures govern their function. Moreover, this is one of the complicated optimization problems that computational biologists have ever faced. Experimental protein structure determination methods include X-ray crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Electron Microscopy. All of these are tedious and time-consuming procedures that require expertise. To make the process less cumbersome, scientists use predictive tools as part of computational methods, using data consolidated in the protein repositories. In recent years, machine learning approaches have raised the interest of the structure prediction community. Most of the machine learning approaches for protein structure prediction are centred on co-evolution based methods. The accuracy of these approaches depends on the number of homologous protein sequences available in the databases. The prediction problem becomes challenging for many proteins, especially those without enough sequence homologs. Deep learning methods allow for the extraction of intricate features from protein sequence data without making any intuitions. Accurately predicted protein structures are employed for drug discovery, antibody designs, understanding protein-protein interactions, and interactions with other molecules. This article provides a review of conventional and deep learning approaches in protein structure prediction. We conclude this review by outlining a few publicly available datasets and deep learning architectures currently employed for protein structure prediction tasks.",

The theory of self-organization in thermodynamic processes far from equilibrium is a cutting-edge theme for the development of a new generation of materials. It could be interpreted as the formation of globally coherent patterns, configurations and orderliness through local interactivities by \"cascade evolution of dissipative structures\". Non-equilibrium thermodynamics, entropy, and dissipative structures connected to self-organization phenomenon (patterning, orderliness) are briefly discussed. Some example evidences are reviewed in detail to show how thermodynamics self-organization can emerge from a non-equilibrium process; fatigue. Evidences including dislocation density evolution, stored energy, temperature, and acoustic signals can be considered as the signature of self-organization. Most of the attention is given to relate an analogy between persistent slip bands (PSBs) and self-organization in metals with single crystals. Some aspects of the stability of dislocations during fatigue of single crystals are discussed using the formulation of excess entropy generation.",

        "abstract": "the characterization of an unusual adenylyl cyclase gene from Plasmodium falciparum, here designated PfACα. The level of mRNA expression is maximum during development of gametocytes (the sexual blood stage of the parasite life cycle). The gene is highly interrupted by 22 introns, and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed that there are multiple mRNA splice variants. One intron has three alternative 3′-splice sites that confer the potential to encode distinct forms of the enzyme using alternative start codons. Deduced amino acid sequences predict membrane-spanning regions, the number of which can vary between two and six depending on the splice variant. Expression of a synthetic form of two of these variants in Xenopus oocytes and in Dictyostelium adenylyl cyclase-deficient mutants, confirms that PfACα is a functional adenylyl cyclase. These results identify a novel mechanism in P. falciparum for the generation of multiple isoforms of a key, membrane-bound signaling molecule from a single genomic copy. Comparisons of the catalytic domains of PfACα and a second putative P. falciparum adenylyl cyclase (PfACβ) with those from other species reveal an unexpected similarity with adenylyl cyclases from certain prokaryotes including the cyanobacteria (blue green algae). In addition, the presence of an unusual active site substitution in a position that determines substrate specificity, also characteristic of these prokaryotic forms of the enzyme, further suggests a plastid origin for the Plasmodium cyclases.",

Patients receiving antiretrovirals for more than two weeks were allocated to the category of treatment (mono, double or triple-plus therapy) they received for the longest period. Results: 1476 patients were recruited by September 2000. Of patients currently receiving antiretroviral therapy, 32 per cent took three or more antiretrovirals including an HIV protease inhibitor (PI) and 27 per cent took triple-plus therapy including a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI).

No significant differences in CSF tryptophan, 5-HIAA, NE, or MHPG concentrations or rhythms were observed between normal volunteers and depressed patients. Neither were there differences in the mean tryptophan-to-serotonin ratio. However, a negative linear relationship was observed between mean concentrations of 5-HIAA and NE in the CSF of the normal volunteers (r = 0.916 [r2 = 0.839], df = 9, P < 0.001) while, in contrast, depressed patients showed no such relationship (r = +0.094 [r2 = 0.00877], df = 9, n.s.). Furthermore, the correlation coefficients expressing the relationship between CSF MHPG and CSF 5-HIAA within the normal and depressed groups were significantly different.

Many security measures focus on active interrogation of the container content by X-ray scan, which might be extended with the newly developed tagged neutron inspection system. Both active interrogation techniques can, with the current huge volume of container traffic, only be applied to a limited number of selected containers. The question arises whether a passive detection technique can offer an alternative solution. This study investigates if containers equipped with a small passive detector will register during transport the neutron irradiation by fissionable material such as plutonium in a measurable way. In practice, 4/5 of the containers are about 1/8 filled with hydrogenous material and undergo a typical 2 months route. For this reference case, it was found that the most compatible passive detector would be an activation foil of iridium. Monte-Carlo simulations showed that for the reference case the activity of a 250 microm thin foil with 6 cm(2) cross-section would register 1.2 Bq when it is irradiated by a significant quantity of Reactor-Grade PuO(2). However this activity drops with almost two orders of magnitude for other fillings and other isotopic compositions and forms of the Pu-source. The procedure of selecting the target material for Pu detection is detailed with the theoretical methods, in order to be useful for other applications. Moreover the value of such additional passive sensors for securing maritime container transport is situated within the global framework of the First, Second and Third Line of Defense against illicit trafficking.",

        "abstract": "The performance of nanoelectronic devices critically depends on the distribution of charge carriers inside such structures. High-vacuum scanning spreading resistance microscopy (HV-SSRM) has established as the method of choice for quantitative 2D-carrier mapping in nanoscale devices during the last decade. However, due to the 3D-nature of these nanoscale device architectures, dopant incorporation and dopant diffusion mechanisms can vary for any of the three dimensions, depending on the particular processes used. Therefore, mapping of carriers in three dimensions with high spatial resolution is inevitable to study and understand the distribution of active dopants in confined 3D-volumes and ultimately to support the process development of next generation devices. In this work, we present for the first time an approach to extend the capabilities of SSRM from an inherent 2D-carrier profiling technique towards a quantitative 3D-characterization technique based on the example of a nanowire (NW)-based heterojunction (SiGe-Si) tunneling transistor. In order to implement a 3D-methodology with a 2D-imaging technique, we acquired 2D-carrier concentration maps on successive cross-section planes through the device of interest. This was facilitated by arranging several devices in a staggered array, allowing to produce a series of cross-sections with incremental offset by a single cleave. A dedicated interpolation algorithm especially suited for structures with rotational symmetry like NWs was developed in order to reconstruct a 3D-carrier distribution map. The validity of the method was assessed by proving the absence of variations in carrier distribution in the third dimension, as expected for NWs etched into a blanket stack.",

Many examples of new hypothesis derived from network analyses can be found in the literature, spanning different organisms including plants and specific fields such as root developmental biology.In order to make the process of constructing a gene co-expression network more accessible to biologists, here we provide step-by-step instructions using published RNA-seq experimental data obtained from a public database. Similar strategies have been used in previous studies to advance root developmental biology.

        "abstract": "We present the results for CAPRI Round 46, the third joint CASP-CAPRI protein assembly prediction challenge. The Round comprised a total of 20 targets including 14 homo-oligomers and 6 heterocomplexes. Eight of the homo-oligomer targets and one heterodimer comprised proteins that could be readily modeled using templates from the Protein Data Bank, often available for the full assembly. The remaining 11 targets comprised 5 homodimers, 3 heterodimers, and two higher-order assemblies. These were more difficult to model, as their prediction mainly involved \"ab-initio\" docking of subunit models derived from distantly related templates. A total of ~30 CAPRI groups, including 9 automatic servers, submitted on average ~2000 models per target. About 17 groups participated in the CAPRI scoring rounds, offered for most targets, submitting ~170 models per target. The prediction performance, measured by the fraction of models of acceptable quality or higher submitted across all predictors groups, was very good to excellent for the nine easy targets. Poorer performance was achieved by predictors for the 11 difficult targets, with medium and high quality models submitted for only 3 of these targets. A similar performance \"gap\" was displayed by scorer groups, highlighting yet again the unmet challenge of modeling the conformational changes of the protein components that occur upon binding or that must be accounted for in template-based modeling. Our analysis also indicates that residues in binding interfaces were less well predicted in this set of targets than in previous Rounds, providing useful insights for directions of future improvements.",

Such receptors would have extensive clinical potential to regulate the activity of engineered therapeutic cells, but to date only receptors against cell surface targets have approached clinical translation1. To address this gap, we developed a receptor architecture called synthetic intramembrane proteolysis receptor (SNIPR), that has the added ability to be activated by soluble ligands, both natural and synthetic, with remarkably low baseline activity and high fold activation, through an endocytic, pH-dependent cleavage mechanism. We demonstrate the therapeutic capabilities of the receptor platform by localizing the activity of CAR T cells to solid tumors where soluble disease-associated factors are expressed, bypassing the major hurdle of on-target off-tumor toxicity in bystander organs. We further applied the SNIPR platform to engineer fully synthetic signaling networks between cells orthogonal to natural signaling pathways, expanding the scope of synthetic biology. Our design framework enables cellular communication and environmental interactions, extending the capabilities of synthetic cellular networking in clinical and research contexts.",

Biophysical characterization of the designed binders revealed nanomolar to low micromolar binding affinities and atomic-level design accuracy. The bound ligands are exposed at one edge of the binding pocket, enabling the de novo design of chemically induced dimerization (CID) systems; we take advantage of this to create a biosensor with nanomolar sensitivity for cortisol.

Here we show that RFdiffusion can be conditioned to efficiently generate protein scaffolds that form geometrically matched extended beta-sheets with target protein edge beta-strands in which polar groups on the target are nearly perfectly complemented with hydrogen bonding groups on the design. We use this approach to design binders against a set of therapeutically relevant polar targets (KIT, PDGFRɑ, ALK-2, ALK-3, FCRL5, and NRP1) and find that beta-strand-targeted design yields higher affinities and success rates than unconditioned RFdiffusion. All by all binding experiments show that the designs have affinities ranging from 137 pM to mid nM for their targets and essentially no off target binding despite the sharing of beta-strand interactions, likely reflecting the precise customization of interacting beta-strand geometry and additional designed binder-target interactions. A co-crystal structure of one such design in complex with the KIT receptor is nearly identical to the computational design model confirming the accuracy of the design approach. The ability to robustly generate binders displaying high affinity and specificity to polar interaction surfaces with exposed beta-strands considerably increases the range and capabilities of computational binder design.",

We show that PP7 is a calcium-dependent phosphatase that interacts with calmodulin and calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1), consistent with a role in calcium signaling. Notably, PP7 was found to be dispensable for erythrocyte invasion, but was crucial for ring-stage development, with PP7-null parasites arresting shortly following invasion and showing no transition to ameboid forms. Phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that PP7 may regulate certain PKAc substrates. Its interaction with calmodulin and CDPK1 further emphasizes a role in calcium signaling, while its impact on early ring development and PKAc substrate phosphorylation underscores its importance in parasite development.",

Nearly 200 obliquity measurements have been obtained based on observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. \n Here, we report on observations of 19 planetary systems, which previously led to 17 clear detections of the RM effect and 2 less secure detections. After adding the new measurements to the tally, we used the entire collection of RM measurements to investigate four issues\n that have arisen in the literature. Here we consider whether:\n i) the obliquity distribution shows a peak at approximately\n 90$^ and ii) the high obliquities are associated with high eccentricities. For the first question, we found tentative evidence that such a peak does exist when restricting attention to the sample of sub-Saturn planets and hot Jupiters orbiting F stars. We find the association to be weaker than previously reported and a stronger association must exist between obliquity and orbital separation, possibly due to tidal obliquity damping at small separations. We also consider iii) how low the lowest known obliquities are; among hot Jupiters around cool stars, we find the dispersion to be $1.4 smaller than the 6$^ obliquity of the Sun, which serves as additional evidence for tidal damping. Finally, we investigate iv) how low the obliquities of stars with compact and flat systems of multiple planets are. We find that they generally have obliquities lower than $10^ with several remarkable exceptions possibly caused by wide-orbiting stellar or planetary companions.",

Therapeutic approaches such as lysosome-targeting chimaeras1,2 (LYTACs) and cytokine receptor-targeting chimeras3 (KineTACs) have used this to target specific proteins for degradation by fusing modified native ligands to target binding proteins. Although powerful, these approaches can be limited by competition with native ligands and requirements for chemical modification that limit genetic encodability and can complicate manufacturing, and, more generally, there may be no native ligands that stimulate endocytosis through a given receptor. Here we describe computational design approaches for endocytosis-triggering binding proteins (EndoTags) that overcome these challenges. We present EndoTags for insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) and asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), sortilin and transferrin receptors, and show that fusing these tags to soluble or transmembrane target protein binders leads to lysosomal trafficking and target degradation. As these receptors have different tissue distributions, the different EndoTags could enable targeting of degradation to different tissues. EndoTag fusion to a PD-L1 antibody considerably increases efficacy in a mouse tumour model compared to antibody alone. The modularity and genetic encodability of EndoTags enables AND gate control for higher-specificity targeted degradation, and the localized secretion of degraders from engineered cells. By promoting endocytosis, EndoTag fusion increases signalling through an engineered ligand-receptor system by nearly 100-fold. EndoTags have considerable therapeutic potential as targeted degradation inducers, signalling activators for endocytosis-dependent pathways, and cellular uptake inducers for targeted antibody-drug and antibody-RNA conjugates.",

We reasoned that while residue level descriptions of biomolecules are efficient for de novo structure prediction, for probing heterogeneity of interactions with small molecules in the folded state an entirely atomic level description could have advantages in speed and generality. We developed a graph neural network called ChemNet trained to recapitulate correct atomic positions from partially corrupted input structures from the Cambridge Structural Database and the Protein Data Bank; the nodes of the graph are the atoms in the system. ChemNet accurately generates structures of diverse organic small molecules given knowledge of their atom composition and bonding, and given a description of the larger protein context, and builds up structures of small molecules and protein side chains for protein-small molecule docking. Because ChemNet is rapid and stochastic, ensembles of predictions can be readily generated to map conformational heterogeneity. In enzyme design efforts described here and elsewhere, we find that using ChemNet to assess the accuracy and pre-organization of the designed active sites results in higher success rates and higher activities; we obtain a preorganized retroaldolase with a k cat/K M of 11000 M-1min-1, considerably higher than any pre-deep learning design for this reaction. We anticipate that ChemNet will be widely useful for rapidly generating conformational ensembles of small molecule and small molecule-protein systems, and for designing higher activity preorganized enzymes.",

Seeded growth and capping experiments reveal that the filaments grow primarily from one end. Oligomers containing 12 copies of the peptide ligand nucleate fiber assembly from monomeric subunit and peptide mixtures at concentrations where assembly occurs very slowly, likely by generating critical local concentrations of monomer in the assembly competent conformation.

The growth factor (GF) domain common to all family members and many of their antagonists evolved from a common cystine knot growth factor (CKGF) domain. The CKGF superfamily comprises six distinct families in primitive metazoans, including the TGF-β and Dan families. Compared with Wnt/Frizzled and Notch/Delta families that also specify body axes, cell fate, tissues, and other families that contain CKGF domains that evolved in parallel, the TGF-β family was the most fruitful in evolution. Complexes between the prodomains and GFs of the TGF-β family suggest a new paradigm for regulating GF release by conversion from closed- to open-arm procomplex conformations. Ternary complexes of the final step in extracellular signaling show how TGF-β GF dimers bind type I and type II receptors on the cell surface, and enable understanding of much of the specificity and promiscuity in extracellular signaling. However, structures suggest that when GFs bind repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family coreceptors, type I receptors do not bind until reaching an intracellular, membrane-enveloped compartment, blurring the line between extra- and intracellular signaling. Modulator protein structures show how structurally diverse antagonists including follistatins, noggin, and members of the chordin family bind GFs to regulate signaling; complexes with the Dan family remain elusive. Much work is needed to understand how these molecular components assemble to form signaling hubs in extracellular environments in vivo.",

Diagnosis is even more difficult due to the fastidious nature of Campylobacter in the laboratory setting. This has, in part, driven a change in recent years, from culture-based to rapid PCR-based diagnostic assays which have improved diagnostic detection, whilst creating a knowledge gap in our clinical and epidemiological understanding of Campylobacter genotypes - no isolates to sequence. In this study, direct metagenomic sequencing approaches were used to assess the possibility of replacing genome sequences with metagenome sequences; metagenomic sequencing outputs were used to describe clinically relevant attributes of Campylobacter genotypes. A total of 37 diarrhoeal stool samples with Campylobacter and five samples with an unknown pathogen result were collected and processed with and without filtration, DNA was extracted, and metagenomes were sequenced by short-read sequencing. Culture-based methods were used to validate Campylobacter metagenome-derived genome (MDG) results. Sequence output metrics were assessed for Campylobacter genome quality and accuracy of characterization. Of the 42 samples passing quality checks for analysis, identification of Campylobacter to the genus and species level was dependent on Campylobacter genome read count, coverage and genome completeness. A total of 65% (24/37) of samples were reliably identified to the genus level through Campylobacter MDG, 73% (27/37) by culture and 97% (36/37) by qPCR. The Campylobacter genomes with a genome completeness of over 60% (n=21) were all accurately identified at the species level (100%). Of those, 72% (15/21) were identified to sequence types (STs), and 95% (20/21) accurately identified antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene determinants. Filtration of stool samples enhanced Campylobacter MDG recovery and genome quality metrics compared to the corresponding unfiltered samples, which improved the identification of STs and AMR profiles. The phylogenetic analysis in this study demonstrated the clustering of the metagenome-derived with culture-derived genomes and revealed the reliability of genomes from direct stool sequencing. Furthermore, Campylobacter genome spiking percentages ranging from 0 to 2% total metagenome abundance in the ONT MinION sequencer, configured to adaptive sequencing, exhibited better assembly quality and accurate identification of STs, particularly in the analysis of metagenomes containing 2 and 1% of Campylobacter jejuni genomes.

However, design guided by similar global parameterization of beta barrel structures has been less successful, likely due to the deviations required from ideal beta barrel geometry to maintain extensive inter-strand hydrogen bonding without introducing considerable backbone strain. Instead, beta barrels and other protein folds have been designed guided by 2D structural blueprints; while this approach has successfully generated new fluorescent proteins, transmembrane nanopores, and other structures, it requires considerable expert knowledge and provides only indirect control over the global barrel shape. Here we show that the simplicity and control over shape and structure provided by global parametric representations can be generalized beyond coiled coils by taking advantage of the rich sequence-structure relationships implicit in RoseTTAFold based inpainting and diffusion design methods. Starting from parametrically generated idealized barrel backbones, both RFjoint inpainting and RFdiffusion readily incorporate the backbone irregularities necessary for proper folding with minimal deviation from the idealized barrel geometries. We show that for beta barrels across a broad range of global beta sheet parameterizations, these methods achieve high in silico and experimental success rates, with atomic accuracy confirmed by an X-ray crystal structure of a novel beta barrel topology, and de novo designed 12, 14, and 16 stranded transmembrane nanopores with conductances ranging from 200 to 500 pS. By combining the simplicity and control of parametric generation with the high success rates of deep learning based protein design methods, our approach makes the design of proteins where global shape confers function, such as beta barrel nanopores, more precisely specifiable and accessible.",

Despite the importance of PKG in the clinically relevant asexual blood stages, many aspects of malarial PKG regulation, including the importance of phosphorylation, remain poorly understood. Here we use genetic and biochemical approaches to show that reduced cGMP binding to cyclic nucleotide binding domain B does not affect in vitro kinase activity but prevents parasite egress. Similarly, we show that phosphorylation of a key threonine residue (T695) in the activation loop is dispensable for kinase activity in vitro but is essential for in vivo PKG function, with loss of T695 phosphorylation leading to aberrant phosphorylation events across the parasite proteome and changes to the substrate specificity of PKG. Our findings indicate that Plasmodium PKG is uniquely regulated to transduce signals crucial for malaria parasite development.",

Three-finger toxins (3FTx) are highly toxic components of elapid snake venoms that can cause diverse pathologies, including severe tissue damage3 and inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) resulting in life-threatening neurotoxicity4. Currently, the only available treatments for snakebite consist of polyclonal antibodies derived from the plasma of immunized animals, which have high cost and limited efficacy against 3FTxs5,6,7. Here, we use deep learning methods to de novo design proteins to bind short- and long-chain α-neurotoxins and cytotoxins from the 3FTx family. With limited experimental screening, we obtain protein designs with remarkable thermal stability, high binding affinity, and near-atomic level agreement with the computational models. The designed proteins effectively neutralize all three 3FTx sub-families in vitro and protect mice from a lethal neurotoxin challenge. Such potent, stable, and readily manufacturable toxin-neutralizing proteins could provide the basis for safer, cost-effective, and widely accessible next-generation antivenom therapeutics.

        "abstract": "the relative orientations of the orbits of exoplanets and wide-orbiting binary companions (semimajor axis greater than 100 AU) can shed light on how planets form and evolve in binary systems. Previous observations by multiple groups discovered a possible alignment between the orbits of visual binaries and the exoplanets that reside in them. In this study, using data from \\textit{Gaia} DR3 and TESS, we confirm the existence of an alignment between the orbits of small planets $(R<6 R_\\oplus)$ and binary systems with semimajor axes below 700 AU ($p=10^{-6}$). However, we find no statistical evidence for alignment between planet and binary orbits for binary semimajor axes greater than 700 AU, and no evidence for alignment of large, closely-orbiting planets (mostly hot Jupiters) and binaries at any separation. The lack of orbital alignment between our large planet sample and their binary companions appears significantly different from our small planet sample, even taking into account selection effects. Therefore, we conclude that any alignment between wide-binaries and our sample of large planets (predominantly hot Jupiters) is probably not as strong as what we observe for small planets in binaries with semimajor axes less than 700 AU. The difference in the alignment distribution of hot Jupiters and smaller planets may be attributed to the unique evolutionary mechanisms occuring in systems that form hot Jupiters, including potentially destabilizing secular resonances that onset as the protoplanetary disk dissipates and high-eccentricity migration occurring after the disk is gone.",

        "abstract": "The Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein MSPDBL2 is a polymorphic antigen targeted by acquired immune responses, and normally expressed in only a minority of mature schizonts. The potential relationship of MSPDBL2 to sexual commitment is examined, as variable mspdbl2 transcript levels and proportions of MSPDBL2-positive mature schizonts in clinical isolates have previously correlated with levels of many sexual stage parasite gene transcripts, although not with the master regulator ap2-g. It is demonstrated that conditional overexpression of the gametocyte development protein GDV1, which promotes sexual commitment, also substantially increases the proportion of MSPDBL2-positive schizonts in culture. Conversely, truncation of the gdv1 gene is shown to prevent any expression of MSPDBL2. However, across diverse P. falciparum cultured lines, the variable proportions of MSPDBL2 positivity in schizonts do not correlate significantly with variable gametocyte conversion rates, indicating it is not involved in sexual commitment. Confirming this, examining a line with endogenous hemagglutinin-tagged AP2-G showed that the individual schizonts expressing MSPDBL2 are mostly different from those expressing AP2-G. Using a selection-linked integration system, modified P. falciparum lines were engineered to express an intact or disrupted version of MSPDBL2, showing the protein is not required for sexual commitment or early gametocyte development. Asexual parasite multiplication rates were also not affected by expression of either intact or disrupted MSPDBL2 in a majority of schizonts. Occurring alongside sexual commitment, the role of the discrete MSPDBL2-positive schizont subpopulation requires further investigation in natural infections where it is under immune selection. IMPORTANCE Malaria parasites in the blood are remarkably variable, able to switch antigenic targets so they may survive within humans who have already developed specific immune responses. This is one of the challenges in developing vaccines against malaria. MSPDBL2 is a target of naturally acquired immunity expressed in minority proportions of schizonts, the end stages of each 2-day replication cycle in red blood cells which contain merozoites prepared to invade new red blood cells. Results show that the proportion of schizonts expressing MSPDBL2 is positively controlled by the expression of the regulatory gametocyte development protein GDV1. It was previously known that expression of GDV1 leads to increased expression of AP2-G which causes parasites to switch to sexual development, so a surprising finding here is that MSPDBL2-positive parasites are mostly distinct from those that express AP2-G. This discrete antigenic subpopulation of mostly asexual parasites is regulated alongside sexually committed parasites, potentially enabling survival under stress conditions.

        "abstract": "Deep learning tools for enzyme design are rapidly emerging, and there is a critical need to evaluate their effectiveness in engineering workflows. Here we show that the deep learning-based tool ProteinMPNN can be used to redesign Fe(II)/αKG superfamily enzymes for greater stability, solubility, and expression while retaining both native activity and industrially relevant non-native functions. This superfamily has diverse catalytic functions and could provide a rich new source of biocatalysts for synthesis and industrial processes. Through systematic comparisons of directed evolution trajectories for a non-native, remote C(sp3)-H hydroxylation reaction, we demonstrate that the stabilized redesign can be evolved more efficiently than the wild-type enzyme. After three rounds of directed evolution, we obtained a 6-fold activity increase from the wild-type parent and an 80-fold increase from the stabilized variant. To generate the initial stabilized variant, we identified multiple structural and sequence constraints to preserve catalytic function. We applied these criteria to produce stabilized, catalytically active variants of a second Fe(II)/αKG enzyme, suggesting that the approach is generalizable to additional members of the Fe(II)/αKG superfamily. ProteinMPNN is user-friendly and widely accessible, and our results provide a framework for the routine implementation of deep learning-based protein stabilization tools in directed evolution workflows for novel biocatalysts.",

By contrast, specificity of protein-protein interactions usually involves backbone shape complementarity1, which is less modular and hence harder to generalize. Coiled-coil heterodimers are an exception, but the restricted geometry of interactions across the heterodimer interface (primarily at the heptad a and d positions2) limits the number of orthogonal pairs that can be created simply by varying side-chain interactions3,4. Here we show that protein-protein interaction specificity can be achieved using extensive and modular side-chain hydrogen-bond networks. We used the Crick generating equations5 to produce millions of four-helix backbones with varying degrees of supercoiling around a central axis, identified those accommodating extensive hydrogen-bond networks, and used Rosetta to connect pairs of helices with short loops and to optimize the remainder of the sequence. Of 97 such designs expressed in Escherichia coli, 65 formed constitutive heterodimers, and the crystal structures of four designs were in close agreement with the computational models and confirmed the designed hydrogen-bond networks. In cells, six heterodimers were fully orthogonal, and in vitro-following mixing of 32 chains from 16 heterodimer designs, denaturation in 5 M guanidine hydrochloride and reannealing-almost all of the interactions observed by native mass spectrometry were between the designed cognate pairs. The ability to design orthogonal protein heterodimers should enable sophisticated protein-based control logic for synthetic biology, and illustrates that nature has not fully explored the possibilities for programmable biomolecular interaction modalities.",

        "abstract": "d: Common failures of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy regimens stem from immune escape of target antigen low tumors. Strategies to improve CAR-T cell therapy efficacy include enhancing intrinsic effector function while preventing T cell exhaustion. The ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20, is a key negative regulator of the NF-kB pathway downstream of T cell receptor activation in T cells. Dysfunctional CD8 T cells in tumors have high expression of A20, and deletion of A20 enhances antitumor activity of CD8 T cells in murine tumor models. We tested whether CRISPR-mediated knock-out (KO) of tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), the gene for A20, increases the effector function and alters the metabolic state of CAR-T cells.\n Results: A20 deletion led to upregulation of NF-κB target genes and resulted in higher levels of activation marker expression and effector cytokine secretion compared to unarmored CAR-T upon incubation with target cells. In addition, A20 KO CAR-T cells maintained prolonged expression of activation markers upon antigen clearance in the absence of enhanced differentiation, and were more resistant to dysfunction in a repeat challenge serial kill assay. In vivo, A20 deficient CAR-T exhibited increased anti-tumor efficacy against low, medium, and high target expressing tumor models. Consistent with NF-κB upregulation, A20 KO cells significantly upregulated key glycolytic intermediates suggesting that amino acid anabolism was fueled by glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Moreover, the preferential increase of glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation confirmed that A20 KO CAR-T cells were skewed towards an effector-like phenotype. Notably, glutathione and its cysteine-glycine bi-products were upregulated upon activation to a higher level in A20 KO CAR-T suggesting enhanced resistance to oxidative stress, in line with their prolonged persistence.\n Conclusions: CRISPR-mediated knock-out of A20 lowers the activation threshold of CAR-T cells producing enhanced in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy particularly against tumors with very low levels of target expression. A20 KO induces metabolic rewiring of CAR-T cells by promoting glycolysis and amino acid anabolism to sustain their superior effector functions. This intrinsic armoring strategy can be applied to any CAR-T in any indication to increase tumor control and reduce immune escape.\n Citation Format: Nina Jia Chu, Carina Nava-Barbero, Ashley Merlino, Ping-Hsien Lee, David Baker, Ben Taylor, Gordon Moody, Letizia Giardino.

Unexpectedly, without modifications by functional ligands, OA nanomicelles significantly activate cellular proteasome function by directly binding to 20S proteasome subunit alpha 6 (PSMA6). Mechanism study reveals that OA nanomicelles interact with PSMA6 to dynamically modulate its N-terminal domain conformation change, thereby controlling the entry of proteins into 20S proteasome. Subsequently, OA nanomicelles accelerate the degradation of several crucial proteins, thus potently driving cancer cell pyroptosis.

One such suggestion is that as each of Erikson's developmental stages is triggered by a crisis, in therapy it is triggered by the client's search. The resolution of the search often leads to the development of another search, which implies that the therapy process comprises a series of searches. This idea of a series of searches and resolutions leads to the understanding that identity is developmental and therapy is a space in which a new sense of identity may emerge. The notion of hope is linked to Erikson's stage of Basic Trust and the proposed model of therapy views hope and trust as essential for the therapy process.

Here, we exploit computational design to specify the size, flexibility, and valency of de novo protein building blocks, as well as the interaction dynamics between them, to investigate how molecular parameters govern the macroscopic viscoelasticity of the resultant protein hydrogels. We construct gel systems from pairs of symmetric protein homo-oligomers, each comprising 2, 5, 24, or 120 individual protein components, that are crosslinked either physically or covalently into idealized step-growth biopolymer networks. Through rheological assessment and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we find that the covalent linkage of multifunctional precursors yields hydrogels whose viscoelasticity depends on the crosslink length between the constituent building blocks. In contrast, reversibly crosslinking the homo-oligomeric components with a computationally designed heterodimer results in non-Newtonian biomaterials exhibiting fluid-like properties under rest and low shear, but shear-stiffening solid-like behavior at higher frequencies. Exploiting the unique genetic encodability of these materials, we demonstrate the assembly of protein networks within living mammalian cells and show via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) that mechanical properties can be tuned intracellularly, in correlation with matching formulations formed extracellularly. We anticipate that the ability to modularly construct and systematically program the viscoelastic properties of designer protein-based materials could have broad utility in biomedicine, with applications in tissue engineering, therapeutic delivery, and synthetic biology.",

SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues.",

        "abstract": "opment of macrocyclic binders to therapeutic proteins typically relies on large-scale screening methods that are resource-intensive and provide little control over binding mode. Despite considerable progress in physics-based methods for peptide design and deep-learning methods for protein design, there are currently no robust approaches for de novo design of protein-binding macrocycles. Here, we introduce RFpeptides, a denoising diffusion-based pipeline for designing macrocyclic peptide binders against protein targets of interest. We test 20 or fewer designed macrocycles against each of four diverse proteins and obtain medium to high-affinity binders against all selected targets. Designs against MCL1 and MDM2 demonstrate KD between 1-10 μM, and the best anti-GABARAP macrocycle binds with a KD of 6 nM and a sub-nanomolar IC50 in vitro. For one of the targets, RbtA, we obtain a high-affinity binder with KD < 10 nM despite starting from the target sequence alone due to the lack of an experimentally determined target structure. X-ray structures determined for macrocycle-bound MCL1, GABARAP, and RbtA complexes match very closely with the computational design models, with three out of the four structures demonstrating Ca RMSD of less than 1.5 Å to the design models. In contrast to library screening approaches for which determining binding mode can be a major bottleneck, the binding modes of RFpeptides-generated macrocycles are known by design, which should greatly facilitate downstream optimization. RFpeptides thus provides a powerful framework for rapid and custom design of macrocyclic peptides for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",

Designing the kinetics and dynamics of a system requires, in addition, the design of excited states that are traversed in transitions from one low-lying state to another2,3. This is a challenging task as such states must be sufficiently strained to be poorly populated, but not so strained that they are not populated at all, and because protein design methods have generally focused on creating near-ideal structures4–7. Here we describe a general approach for designing systems which use an induced-fit power stroke8 to generate a structurally frustrated9 and strained excited state, allosterically driving protein complex dissociation. X-ray crystallography, double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy, and kinetic binding measurements demonstrate that incorporating excited states enables design of effector-induced increases in dissociation rates as high as 6000-fold. We highlight the power of this approach by designing cytokine mimics which can be dissociated within seconds from their receptors.",

Despite the impressive advances made in the field, the ultimate goal of designing efficient enzyme mimics for these reactions is still elusive. Its realization will require a deeper understanding of the diverse chemical factors that influence the activities of both natural and synthetic catalysts. They include catalyst-substrate complexation, non-covalent interactions and the electronic nature of the metal ion, ligand environment and nucleophile. Based on our computational studies, their roles are discussed for several mono- and binuclear metallohydrolases and their synthetic analogues. Hydrolysis by natural metallohydrolases is found to be promoted by a ligand environment with low basicity, a metal bound water and a heterobinuclear metal center (in binuclear enzymes). Additionally, peptide and phosphoester hydrolysis is dominated by two competing effects, i.e. nucleophilicity and Lewis acid activation, respectively. In synthetic analogues, hydrolysis is facilitated by the inclusion of a second metal center, hydrophobic effects, a biological metal (Zn, Cu and Co) and a terminal hydroxyl nucleophile. Due to the absence of the protein environment, hydrolysis by these small molecules is exclusively influenced by nucleophile activation. The results gleaned from these studies will enhance the understanding of fundamental principles of multiple hydrolytic reactions. They will also advance the development of computational methods as a predictive tool to design more efficient catalysts for hydrolysis, Diels-Alder reaction, Michael addition, epoxide opening and aldol condensation.",

However, nearly all nanoparticles designed to date exhibit strict point group symmetry, with each subunit occupying an identical, symmetrically related environment. This property limits the structural diversity that can be achieved and precludes anisotropic functionalization. Here, we describe a general computational strategy for designing multi-component bifaceted protein nanomaterials with two distinctly addressable sides. The method centers on docking pseudosymmetric heterooligomeric building blocks in architectures with dihedral symmetry and designing an asymmetric protein-protein interface between them. We used this approach to obtain an initial 30-subunit assembly with pseudo-D5 symmetry, and then generated an additional 15 variants in which we controllably altered the size and morphology of the bifaceted nanoparticles by designing de novo extensions to one of the subunits. Functionalization of the two distinct faces of the nanoparticles with de novo protein minibinders enabled specific colocalization of two populations of polystyrene microparticles coated with target protein receptors. The ability to accurately design anisotropic protein nanomaterials with precisely tunable structures and functions will be broadly useful in applications that require colocalizing two or more distinct target moieties.",

We reasoned that designed agonists that induce different conformational changes in the receptor might induce different downstream responses, which could be useful both therapeutically and to shed light on how extracellular conformation is coupled to intracellular signaling. We used de novo protein design to first generate binders to individual IR extracellular domains, and then to fuse these together in different orientations and with different conformational flexibility. We describe a series of synthetic agonists that signal through the IR that differ from insulin and from each other in the induction of receptor autophosphorylation, MAPK activation, intracellular trafficking, and cell proliferation. We identify designs that are more potent than insulin causing much longer lasting reductions in glucose levels, and that retain signaling activity on disease-causing receptor mutants that do not respond to insulin. These results inform our understanding of how changes in receptor conformation and dynamics are transmitted to downstream signaling, and our synthetic agonists have considerable therapeutic potential for diabetes and severe insulin resistance syndromes. Highlights Computational design yielded super agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists of IR. De novo agonists induce a distinct IR active conformation. Designed agonists tune IR signaling by modulating conformational dynamics of activated IR.

By directly targeting the toxin rather than the pathogen, these molecules have the advantage of immediate cessation of disease and lower selective pressure for escape compared to conventional antibiotics. As C. difficile infects the colon, the protease and pH resistance of the designed proteins opens the door to oral delivery of engineered biologics. Significance statement C. difficile infection (CDI) is a major public health concern with over half a million cases in the United States annually resulting in 30,000 deaths. Current therapies are inadequate and frequently result in cycles of recurrent infection (rCDI). Progress has been made in the development of anti-toxin mAb therapies that can reduce the rate of rCDI, but these remain unaffordable and out of reach for many patients.

The European Respiratory Society (ERS) and European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) established a multidisciplinary collaboration of clinicians with expertise in managing pleural infection with the aim of producing a comprehensive review of the scientific literature. Six areas of interest were identified: 1) epidemiology of pleural infection, 2) optimal antibiotic strategy, 3) diagnostic parameters for chest tube drainage, 4) status of intrapleural therapies, 5) role of surgery and 6) current place of outcome prediction in management. The literature revealed that recently updated epidemiological data continue to show an overall upwards trend in incidence, but there is an urgent need for a more comprehensive characterisation of the burden of pleural infection in specific populations such as immunocompromised hosts. There is a sparsity of regular analyses and documentation of microbiological patterns at a local level to inform geographical variation, and ongoing research efforts are needed to improve antibiotic stewardship. The evidence remains in favour of a small-bore chest tube optimally placed under image guidance as an appropriate initial intervention for most cases of pleural infection. With a growing body of data suggesting delays to treatment are key contributors to poor outcomes, this suggests that earlier consideration of combination intrapleural enzyme therapy (IET) with concurrent surgical consultation should remain a priority. Since publication of the MIST-2 study, there has been considerable data supporting safety and efficacy of IET, but further studies are needed to optimise dosing using individualised biomarkers of treatment failure. Pending further prospective evaluation, the MIST-2 regimen remains the most evidence based.

Moreover, free soluble Notch ligand is signal inhibitory. Here, we exploit computationally designed protein oligomers with precise geometries and valencies to generate cytokine-like, ‘protein only,’ multivalent soluble Notch agonists. These tools promote cell-cell contact, cluster Notch proteins in synapses at the cell surface, and activate Notch signaling in reporter cell lines and cells expressing endogenous receptors. We demonstrate the utility of these soluble Notch agonists in T cell differentiation from cord blood (CB) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and in bioreactor production of T cells in liquid suspension. Soluble multivalent Notch agonists can be applied broadly to in vitro cellular differentiation methods to generate clinical cell products and to develop immunotherapies.",

In an effort to make the design of such materials fully programmable, we first developed a computational design method for generating metal-mediated 3D frameworks using rigid and symmetric peptide macrocycles with metal-coordinating sidechains. We solved the structures of six crystalline networks involving conformationally constrained 6 to 12 residue cyclic peptides with C2, C3, and S2 internal symmetry and three different types of metals (Zn2+, Co2+, or Cu2+) by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, which reveals how the peptide sequences, backbone symmetries, and metal coordination preferences drive the assembly of the resulting structures. In contrast to smaller ligands, these peptides associate through peptide-peptide interactions without full coordination of the metals, contrary to one of the assumptions underlying our computational design method. The cyclic peptides are the largest peptidic ligands reported to form crystalline coordination polymers with transition metals to date, and while more work is required to develop methods for fully programming their crystal structures, the combination of high chemical diversity with synthetic accessibility makes them attractive building blocks for engineering a broader set of new crystalline materials for use in applications such as sensing, asymmetric catalysis, and chiral separation.",

Most of the mineralized tooth structure is composed of dentin, a material produced and mineralized by ectomesenchyme derived cells known as odontoblasts. Clinicians, scientists, and the general public share the desire to regenerate this missing tooth structure. To bioengineer missing dentin, increased understanding of human tooth development is required. Here we interrogate at the single cell level the signaling interactions that guide human odontoblast and ameloblast development and which determine incisor or molar tooth germ type identity. During human odontoblast development, computational analysis predicts that early FGF and BMP activation followed by later HH signaling is crucial. Application of this sci-RNA-seq analysis generates a differentiation protocol to produce mature hiPSC derived odontoblasts in vitro (iOB). Further, we elucidate the critical role of FGF signaling in odontoblast maturation and its biomineralization capacity using the de novo designed FGFR1/2c isoform specific minibinder scaffolded as a C6 oligomer that acts as a pathway agonist. We find that FGFR1c is upregulated in functional odontoblasts and specifically plays a crucial role in driving odontoblast maturity. Using computational tools, we show on a molecular level how human molar development is delayed compared to incisors. We reveal that enamel knot development is guided by FGF and WNT in incisors and BMP and ROBO in the molars, and that incisor and molar ameloblast development is guided by FGF, EGF and BMP signaling, with tooth type specific intensity of signaling interactions. Dental ectomesenchyme derived cells are the primary source of signaling ligands responsible for both enamel knot and ameloblast development.",

Despite this potential, de novo design of all-β-sheet proteins from first principles lags far behind the design of all-α or mixed-αβ domains owing to their non-local nature and the tendency of exposed β-strand edges to aggregate. Through study of loops connecting unpaired β-strands (β-arches), we have identified a series of structural relationships between loop geometry, side chain directionality and β-strand length that arise from hydrogen bonding and packing constraints on regular β-sheet structures. We use these rules to de novo design jellyroll structures with double-stranded β-helices formed by eight antiparallel β-strands. The nuclear magnetic resonance structure of a hyperthermostable design closely matched the computational model, demonstrating accurate control over the β-sheet structure and loop geometry. Our results open the door to the design of a broad range of non-local β-sheet protein structures.",

        "title": "Sex: Two Billion Years of Procreation and Recreation",
        "abstract": "Almost two decades of unprecedented efforts in research costing US taxpayers over $50 billion have failed to defeat Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and have failed to explain the chronology and epidemiology of AIDS in America and Europe. The failure to cure AIDS is so complete that the largest American AIDS foundation is even exploiting it for fundraising: 'Latest AIDS statistics-0,000,000 cured. Support a cure, support AMFAR.' The scientific basis of all these unsuccessful efforts has been the hypothesis that AIDS is caused by a sexually transmitted virus, termed Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and that this viral immunodeficiency manifests in 30 previously known microbial and non-microbial AIDS diseases. In order to develop a hypothesis that explains AIDS we have considered ten relevant facts that American and European AIDS patients have, and do not have, in common: (1) AIDS is not contagious. For example, not even one health care worker has contracted AIDS from over 800,000 AIDS patients in America and Europe. (2) AIDS is highly non-random with regard to sex (86% male); sexual persuasion (over 60% homosexual); and age (85% are 25-49 years old). (3) From its beginning in 1980, the AIDS epidemic progressed non-exponentially, just like lifestyle diseases. (4) The epidemic is fragmented into distinct subepidemics with exclusive AIDS-defining diseases. For example, only homosexual males have Kaposi's sarcoma. (5) Patients do not have any one of 30 AIDS-defining diseases, nor even immunodeficiency, in common. For example, Kaposi's sarcoma, dementia, and weight loss may occur without immunodeficiency. Thus, there is no AIDS-specific disease. (6) AIDS patients have antibody against HIV in common only by definition-not by natural coincidence. AIDS-defining diseases of HIV-free patients are called by their old names. (7) Recreational drug use is a common denominator for over 95% of all American and European AIDS patients, including male homosexuals. (8) Lifetime prescriptions of inevitably toxic anti-HIV drugs, such as the DNA chain-terminator AZT, are another common denominator of AIDS patients. (9) HIV proves to be an ideal surrogate marker for recreational and anti-HIV drug use. Since the virus is very rare (< 0.3%) in the US/European population and very hard to transmit sexually, only those who inject street drugs or have over 1,000 typically drug-mediated sexual contacts are likely to become positive. (10) The huge AIDS literature cannot offer even one statistically significant group of drug-free AIDS patients from America and Europe. In view of this, we propose that the long-term consumption of recreational drugs (such as cocaine, heroin, nitrite inhalants, and amphetamines) and prescriptions of DNA chain-terminating and other anti-HIV drugs, cause all AIDS diseases in America and Europe that exceed their long-established, national backgrounds, i.e. > 95%. Chemically distinct drugs cause distinct AIDS-defining diseases; for example, nitrite inhalants cause Kaposi's sarcoma, cocaine causes weight loss, and AZT causes immunodeficiency, lymphoma, muscle atrophy, and dementia. The drug hypothesis predicts that AIDS: (1) is non-contagious; (2) is non-random, because 85% of AIDS causing drugs are used by males, particularly sexually active homosexuals between 25 and 49 years of age, and (3) would follow the drug epidemics chronologically. Indeed, AIDS has increased from negligible numbers in the early 1980s to about 80,000 annual cases in the early '90s and has since declined to about 50,000 cases (US figures). In the same period, recreational drug users have increased from negligible numbers to millions by the late 1980s, and have since decreased possibly twofold. However, AIDS has declined less because since 1987 increasing numbers of mostly healthy, HIV-positive people, currently about 200,000, use anti-HIV drugs that cause AIDS and other diseases.

Here we describe the computational design of mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles with rigid structures that feature internal cyclic symmetries or improper rotational symmetries inaccessible to natural proteins. Crystal structures of three C2- and C3-symmetric macrocycles, and of six diverse S2-symmetric macrocycles, match the computationally-designed models with backbone heavy-atom RMSD values of 1 Å or better. Crystal structures of an S4-symmetric macrocycle (consisting of a sequence and structure segment mirrored at each of three successive repeats) designed to bind zinc reveal a large-scale zinc-driven conformational change from an S4-symmetric apo-state to a nearly inverted S4-symmetric holo-state almost identical to the design model. These symmetric structures provide promising starting points for applications ranging from design of cyclic peptide based metal organic frameworks to creation of high affinity binders of symmetric protein homo-oligomers. More generally, this work demonstrates the power of computational design for exploring symmetries and structures not found in nature, and for creating synthetic switchable systems.",

TfR1 can mediate cellular uptake of both Tf and H-ferritin, an iron storage protein. New World arenaviruses, which cause hemorrhagic fever, and Plasmodium vivax use TfR1 for entry into host cells. Human TfR2, another receptor for Tf, is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes and erythroid precursors, and holo-Tf dramatically upregulates its expression. TfR2 forms a complex with hemochromatosis protein, HFE, and serves as a component of the iron sensing machinery in hepatocytes. Defects in TfR2 cause systemic iron overload, hemochromatosis, through down-regulation of hepcidin. In erythroid cells, TfR2 forms a complex with the erythropoietin receptor and regulates erythropoiesis. TfR2 facilitates iron transport from lysosomes to mitochondria in erythroblasts and dopaminergic neurons. Administration of apo-Tf, which scavenges free iron, has been explored for various clinical conditions including atransferrinemia, iron overload, and tissue ischemia. Apo-Tf has also been shown to ameliorate anemia in animal models of β-thalassemia. In this review, I provide an update and summary on our knowledge of mammalian Tf and its receptors.",

Here, we provide an updated analysis of the evolutionary relationships between CRISPR-Cas systems and Cas proteins. Three major types of CRISPR-Cas system are delineated, with a further division into several subtypes and a few chimeric variants. Given the complexity of the genomic architectures and the extremely dynamic evolution of the CRISPR-Cas systems, a unified classification of these systems should be based on multiple criteria. Accordingly, we propose a 'polythetic' classification that integrates the phylogenies of the most common cas genes, the sequence and organization of the CRISPR repeats and the architecture of the CRISPR-cas loci.",

Fusion proteins are constructed by the linking of two protein domains with a peptide linker. The selection of a linker sequence is important for the construction of stable and bioactive fusion proteins. Empirically designed linkers are generally classified into two categories according to their structural features: flexible linkers and rigid linkers. Rigid linkers with the α-helix-forming sequences A(EAAAK)nA (n=2-5) were first designed about two decades ago to control the distance between two protein domains and to reduce their interference. Thereafter, the helical linkers have been applied to the construction of many fusion proteins to improve expression and bioactivity. In addition, the design of fusion proteins that self-assemble into supramolecular complexes is useful for nanobiotechnology and synthetic biology. A protein that forms a self-assembling oligomer was fused by a rigid helical linker to another protein that forms another self-assembling oligomer, and the fusion protein symmetrically self-assembled into a designed protein nanoparticle or nanomaterial. Moreover, to construct chain-like polymeric nanostructures, extender protein nanobuilding blocks were designed by tandemly fusing two dimeric de novo proteins with helical or flexible linkers. The linker design of fusion proteins can affect conformation and dynamics of self-assembling nanostructures. The present review and methods focus on useful helical linkers to construct bioactive fusion proteins and protein-based nanostructures.",

X-ray crystallography shows that one designed protein binds two chlorophylls in a binding orientation matching native special pairs, while a second positions them in a previously unseen geometry. Spectroscopy reveals excitonic coupling, and fluorescence lifetime imaging demonstrates energy transfer. We designed special pair proteins to assemble into 24-chlorophyll octahedral nanocages; the design model and cryo-EM structure are nearly identical. The design accuracy and energy transfer function of these special pair proteins suggest that de novo design of artificial photosynthetic systems is within reach of current computational methods.",

For design of binding to symmetric ligands, protein homo-oligomers with matching symmetry are advantageous as each protein subunit can make identical interactions with the ligand. Here, we describe a general approach to designing hyperstable C2 symmetric proteins with pockets of diverse size and shape. We first designed repeat proteins that sample a continuum of curvatures but have low helical rise, then docked these into C2 symmetric homodimers to generate an extensive range of C2 symmetric cavities. We used this approach to design thousands of C2 symmetric homodimers, and characterized 101 of them experimentally. Of these, the geometry of 31 were confirmed by small angle X-ray scattering and 2 were shown by crystallographic analyses to be in close agreement with the computational design models. These scaffolds provide a rich set of starting points for binding a wide range of C2 symmetric compounds.",

We find that: 1) Receptor activation leads to endogenous Ras signaling at endomembranes, which is enhanced by golgi-localized guanine exchange factors. 2) Recruitment of SAM68 and MARCKS to oncogenic condensates fuels local Ras signaling and cell growth. 3) Major Vault Protein drives RasG12C inhibitor resistance by enhancing signaling at the golgi and altering mitochondrial metabolism.

        "abstract": "S/GOALS: We aim to discover safer and more effective therapeutics for CNS disorders. Current therapeutic development is hindered by dosing out drugs for safe consumption. By identifying proteins with narrow functional roles in the brain (i.e., behavioral control), we can develop drugs targeting these proteins for improved treatment safety and efficacy. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We focused on an evolutionarily new, non-neuronal, non-synaptic glutamate signaling mechanism, system xc- (Sxc). Sxc activity was eliminated by mutating the gene Slc7a11 through pronuclear injection of zinc-finger nucleases into Sprague Dawley rat embryos to create a line of rats lacking Sxc (MSxc). To confirm Sxc mutation, we verified that tissue from MSxc rats had a complete lack of xCT, which is the regulatory subunit of Sxc that is encoded by Slc7a11. We also verified that astrocyte cultures generated from MSxc tissue lacked cystine-evoked glutamate release. Next, we measured development (body weight), CNS regulation of metabolism, and other indicators of generalized, non-specific brain function as well as behaviors that are reliant on behavioral control, such as impulse control and response inhibition. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Eliminating Sxc was not lethal and did not impair development or produce widespread changes in brain function as is commonly observed when deleting other glutamate mechanisms. MSxc rats did not differ from wildtype in growth rate, central regulation of metabolism as reflected by absolute or diurnal changes in core body temperature, locomotor activity in a familiar or novel environment, or simple forms of cognition such as novel object recognition, or operant responding (food and cocaine-reinforced). In contrast, behaviors that rely on behavioral control were impaired. MSxc rats displayed deficits in impulse control and behavioral flexibility. We hypothesize that MSxc rats will also show deficits in response inhibition using the stop signal reaction time task, a common metric used in clinical populations. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Eliminating Sxc activity in rats produced deficits in behaviors reliant on impulse control, without impacting development or simple brain function. These results show the potential of targeting Sxc to restore behavioral control without generating therapeutically limiting adverse effects resulting from non-specific changes in brain function.",

        "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy diagnosed in children and adolescents with a high propensity for local invasion and distant metastasis. Despite current multidisciplinary treatments, there has not been a drastic change in overall prognosis within the last two decades. With current treatments, 60-70 % of patients with localized disease survive. Given a propensity of Wnt signaling to control multiple cellular processes, including proliferation, cell fate determination, and differentiation, it is a critical pathway in OS disease progression. At the same time, this pathway is extremely complex with vast arrays of cross-talk. Even though decades of research have linked the role of Wnt to tumorigenesis, there are still outstanding areas that remain poorly understood and even controversial. The canonical Wnt pathway functions to regulate the levels of the transcriptional co-activator β-catenin, which ultimately controls key developmental gene expressions. Given the central role of this mediator, inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been investigated as a potential strategy for cancer control. In OS, several secreted protein families modulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, including secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs), Wnt inhibitory protein (WIF), Dickkopf proteins (DKK-1,2,3), sclerostin, and small molecules. This chapter focuses on our current understanding of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in OS, based on recent in vitro and in vivo data. Wnt activates noncanonical signaling pathways as well that are independent of β-catenin which will be discussed. In addition, stem cells and their association with Wnt/β-catenin are important factors to consider. Ultimately, the multiple canonical and noncanonical Wnt/β-catenin agonists and antagonists need to be further explored for potential targeted therapies.",

However, experimental methods for the generation of therapeutic antibodies such as using immunized mice or directed evolution remain time consuming and cannot target a specific antigen epitope. Here, we describe the application of a computational framework called OptMAVEn combined with molecular dynamics to de novo design antibodies. Our reference system is antibody 2D10, a single-chain antibody (scFv) that recognizes the dodecapeptide DVFYPYPYASGS, a peptide mimic of mannose-containing carbohydrates. Five de novo designed scFvs sharing less than 75% sequence similarity to all existing natural antibody sequences were generated using OptMAVEn and their binding to the dodecapeptide was experimentally characterized by biolayer interferometry and isothermal titration calorimetry. Among them, three scFvs show binding affinity to the dodecapeptide at the nM level. Critically, these de novo designed scFvs exhibit considerably diverse modeled binding modes with the dodecapeptide. The results demonstrate the potential of OptMAVEn for the de novo design of thermally and conformationally stable antibodies with high binding affinity to antigens and encourage the targeting of other antigen targets in the future.

However, because of the intrinsic flexibility and irregularity of loop regions, organizing multiple structured loops at protein functional sites has been very difficult to achieve by de novo protein design. Here we describe a solution to this problem that generates structured loops buttressed by extensive hydrogen bonding interactions with two neighboring loops and with secondary structure elements. We use this approach to design tandem repeat proteins with buttressed loops ranging from 9 to 14 residues in length. Experimental characterization shows the designs are folded and monodisperse, highly soluble, and thermally stable. Crystal structures are in close agreement with the computational design models, with the loops structured and buttressed by their neighbors as designed. We demonstrate the functionality afforded by loop buttressing by designing and characterizing binders for extended peptides in which the loops form one side of an extended binding pocket. The ability to design multiple structured loops should contribute quite generally to efforts to design new protein functions.",

Archaeological excavations have unearthed a ditch containing approximately one hundred unusual dead human skulls in the rammed-earth foundations of the palace area. The identity and origin of the skulls have long been disputed. In this work, strontium, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses were carried out on 11 human skulls and 1 tooth from the ditch, as well as on 11 human bones, 11 human teeth from the ordinary tombs and 10 pig teeth from the Zhengzhou Shang City site. We determined that, in Zhengzhou Shang City, the local strontium isotope ratio ranges from 0.711606 to 0.711884, and ordinary inhabitants consumed mainly C4 plants supplemented by C3 plants. Moreover, humans buried in the ditch have 87Sr/86Sr values from 0.711335 to 0.711741 and consumed only C4 plants. Combining the isotopic data with the archaeological and cultural context, it is concluded that the unusual human skulls in the ditch are most likely those of prisoners of war captured by the central forces conquering the Xiaomintun area of Anyang in the early Shang Dynasty. The results provide valuable insight into the history of violence and military warfare in the early Chinese dynasty.",

Here we describe parametric generation and deep learning-based methods for designing proteins to address this challenge. We show that by extending RFdiffusion8 to enable binder design to flexible targets, and to refining input structure models by successive noising and denoising (partial diffusion), picomolar-affinity binders can be generated to helical peptide targets by either refining designs generated with other methods, or completely de novo starting from random noise distributions without any subsequent experimental optimization. The RFdiffusion designs enable the enrichment and subsequent detection of parathyroid hormone and glucagon by mass spectrometry, and the construction of bioluminescence-based protein biosensors.

However, to date, the majority of these microbial surveys have focused on the prokaryome, and have largely ignored or overlooked the NHP gut mycobiome.\n To address this shortfall, we have undertaken a region-by-region taxonomic survey of the cynomolgus intestinal mycobiota, from duodenum to distal colon, of ten captive animals of differing age. Using a high-throughput ITS1 amplicon sequencing-based approach, we found that fungi from the Ascomycota phylum dominate the cynomolgus enteric mycobiota.

We found that the primary kinetic barrier to Par complex assembly is the relief of Par6 autoinhibition, and that inducing Par complex cortical polarity was sufficient to induce two key hallmarks of asymmetric cell division in unpolarized cells: spindle orientation and central spindle asymmetry. These two outputs of the Par complex are separately controlled: spindle orientation is determined by Par3 and does not require the kinase activity of aPKC, while central spindle asymmetry solely depends on an asymmetric activity of aPKC at the cortex. Our work shows how polarity information flows between the cortex and the cytosol despite its diffusive nature, and paves the way towards induction of asymmetric cell division in cultured cells.",

The outer membrane has a number of unique features, including an asymmetric lipid bilayer, the presence of lipopolysaccharides and an individual proteome. The vast majority of the integral transmembrane proteins in the outer membrane belongs to the family of β-barrel proteins. These evolutionarily related proteins share a cylindrical, anti-parallel β-sheet core fold spanning the outer membrane. The loops and accessory domains attached to the β-barrel allow for a remarkable versatility in function for these proteins, ranging from diffusion pores and transporters to enzymes and adhesins.

        "abstract": "Asexual blood-stage malaria parasites must produce sexual progeny to infect mosquitoes. It is important to understand the scope and causes of intraspecific variation in sexual commitment rates, particularly for the major human parasite P. falciparum. First, two alternative assay methods of measuring sexual commitment were compared to test a genetically modified P. falciparum line with elevated commitment rates inducible by overexpression of GDV1. The methods yielded correlated measurements with higher sensitivity and precision being achieved by one employing detection of the early gametocyte differentiation marker Pfs16. Thus, this was used to survey a diverse range of parasite lines and test each in multiple biological replicate assays in a serum-free medium supplemented with Albumax. There were differences among six recent clinical isolates from Ghana in their mean rates of sexual commitment per cycle, ranging from 3.3% to 12.2%. Among 13 diverse long-term laboratory-adapted lines, mean sexual commitment rates for most ranged from 4.7% to 13.4%, a few had lower rates with means from 0.3 to 1.6%, and one with a nonfunctional ap2-g gene always showed zero commitment. Among a subset of lines tested for the effects of exogenous choline to suppress commitment, there were significant differences. As expected, there was no effect in a line that had lost the gdv1 gene and that had generally low commitment, whereas the others showed quantitatively variable but significant responses to choline, suggesting potential trait variation. The results indicated the value of performing multiple replicate assays for understanding the variation of this key reproductive trait that likely affects transmission. IMPORTANCE Only sexual-stage malaria parasites are transmitted from human blood to mosquitoes. Thus, it is vital to understand variations in sexual commitment rates because these may be modifiable or susceptible to blocking. Two different methods of commitment rate measurement were first compared, demonstrating higher sensitivity and precision by the detection of an early differentiation marker, which was subsequently used to survey diverse lines. Clinical isolates from Ghana showed significant variation in mean per-cycle commitment rates and variation among biological replicates. Laboratory-adapted lines of diverse origins had a wider range with most being within the range observed for the clinical isolates, while a minority consistently had lower or zero rates. There was quantitative variation in the effects when adding choline to suppress commitment, indicating differing responsiveness of parasites to this environmental modification. Performing multiple assay replicates and comparisons of diverse isolates was important to understand this trait and its potential effects on transmission.",

By contrast, specificity of protein-protein interactions usually involves backbone shape complementarity1, which is less modular and hence harder to generalize. Coiled-coil heterodimers are an exception, but the restricted geometry of interactions across the heterodimer interface (primarily at the heptad a and d positions2) limits the number of orthogonal pairs that can be created simply by varying side-chain interactions3,4. Here we show that protein-protein interaction specificity can be achieved using extensive and modular side-chain hydrogen-bond networks. We used the Crick generating equations5 to produce millions of four-helix backbones with varying degrees of supercoiling around a central axis, identified those accommodating extensive hydrogen-bond networks, and used Rosetta to connect pairs of helices with short loops and to optimize the remainder of the sequence. Of 97 such designs expressed in Escherichia coli, 65 formed constitutive heterodimers, and the crystal structures of four designs were in close agreement with the computational models and confirmed the designed hydrogen-bond networks. In cells, six heterodimers were fully orthogonal, and in vitro-following mixing of 32 chains from 16 heterodimer designs, denaturation in 5 M guanidine hydrochloride and reannealing-almost all of the interactions observed by native mass spectrometry were between the designed cognate pairs.

        "abstract": "t in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequencing in Africa over the past year has led to a major increase in the number of sequences that have been generated and used to track the pandemic on the continent, a number that now exceeds 100,000 genomes. Our results show an increase in the number of African countries that are able to sequence domestically and highlight that local sequencing enables faster turnaround times and more-regular routine surveillance. Despite limitations of low testing proportions, findings from this genomic surveillance study underscore the heterogeneous nature of the pandemic and illuminate the distinct dispersal dynamics of variants of concern—particularly Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron—on the continent. Sustained investment for diagnostics and genomic surveillance in Africa is needed as the virus continues to evolve while the continent faces many emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats. These investments are crucial for pandemic preparedness and response and will serve the health of the continent well into the 21st century. Description Surveillance across Africa The past 2 years, during which waves of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants swept the globe, have starkly highlighted health disparities across nations. Tegally et al. show how the coordinated efforts of talented African scientists have in a short time made great contributions to pandemic surveillance and data gathering. Their efforts and initiatives have provided early warning that has likely benefited wealthier countries more than their own. Genomic surveillance identified the emergence of the highly transmissible Beta and Omicron variants and now the appearance of Omicron sublineages in Africa. However, it is imperative that technology transfer for diagnostics and vaccines, as well the logistic wherewithal to produce and deploy them, match the data-gathering effort. —CA Expanding SARS-CoV-2 sequencing capacity allowed monitoring of a fast-evolving pandemic across Africa. INTRODUCTION Investment in Africa over the past year with regard to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequencing has led to a massive increase in the number of sequences, which, to date, exceeds 100,000 sequences generated to track the pandemic on the continent. These sequences have profoundly affected how public health officials in Africa have navigated the COVID-19 pandemic. RATIONALE We demonstrate how the first 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Africa have helped monitor the epidemic on the continent, how genomic surveillance expanded over the course of the pandemic, and how we adapted our sequencing methods to deal with an evolving virus. Finally, we also examine how viral lineages have spread across the continent in a phylogeographic framework to gain insights into the underlying temporal and spatial transmission dynamics for several variants of concern (VOCs). RESULTS Our results indicate that the number of countries in Africa that can sequence the virus within their own borders is growing and that this is coupled with a shorter turnaround time from the time of sampling to sequence submission. Ongoing evolution necessitated the continual updating of primer sets, and, as a result, eight primer sets were designed in tandem with viral evolution and used to ensure effective sequencing of the virus. The pandemic unfolded through multiple waves of infection that were each driven by distinct genetic lineages, with B.1-like ancestral strains associated with the first pandemic wave of infections in 2020. Successive waves on the continent were fueled by different VOCs, with Alpha and Beta cocirculating in distinct spatial patterns during the second wave and Delta and Omicron affecting the whole continent during the third and fourth waves, respectively. Phylogeographic reconstruction points toward distinct differences in viral importation and exportation patterns associated with the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants and subvariants, when considering both Africa versus the rest of the world and viral dissemination within the continent. Our epidemiological and phylogenetic inferences therefore underscore the heterogeneous nature of the pandemic on the continent and highlight key insights and challenges, for instance, recognizing the limitations of low testing proportions. We also highlight the early warning capacity that genomic surveillance in Africa has had for the rest of the world with the detection of new lineages and variants, the most recent being the characterization of various Omicron subvariants. CONCLUSION Sustained investment for diagnostics and genomic surveillance in Africa is needed as the virus continues to evolve. This is important not only to help combat SARS-CoV-2 on the continent but also because it can be used as a platform to help address the many emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats in Africa. In particular, capacity building for local sequencing within countries or within the continent should be prioritized because this is generally associated with shorter turnaround times, providing the most benefit to local public health authorities tasked with pandemic response and mitigation and allowing for the fastest reaction to localized outbreaks. These investments are crucial for pandemic preparedness and response and will serve the health of the continent well into the 21st century. Expanse of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing capacity in Africa.

        "abstract": "Cigarette smoking impairs the lung innate immune response making smokers more susceptible to infections and severe symptoms. Dysregulation of cell death is emerging as a key player in chronic inflammatory conditions. We have recently reported that short exposure of human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) altered the TLR4-dependent response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). CSE caused inhibition of the MyD88-dependent inflammatory response and activation of TRIF/caspase-8/caspase-1 pathway leading to Gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage and increased cell permeability. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that activation of caspase-8 by CSE increased pro-inflammatory cell death of LPS-stimulated macrophages. To this purpose, we measured apoptotic and pyroptotic markers as well as the expression/release of pro-inflammatory mediators in hMDMs exposed to LPS and CSE, alone or in combination, for 6 and 24 h. We show that LPS/CSE-treated hMDMs, but not cells treated with CSE or LPS alone, underwent lytic cell death (LDH release) and displayed apoptotic features (activation of caspase-8 and -3/7, nuclear condensation, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization). Moreover, the negative regulator of caspase-8, coded by CFLAR gene, was downregulated by CSE. Activation of caspase-3 led to Gasdermin E (GSDME) cleavage. Notably, lytic cell death caused the release of the damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) heat shock protein-60 (HSP60) and S100A8/A9. This was accompanied by an impaired inflammatory response resulting in inhibited and delayed release of IL6 and TNF. Of note, increased cleaved caspase-3, higher levels of GSDME and altered expression of cell death-associated genes were found in alveolar macrophages of smoker subjects compared to non-smoking controls. Overall, our findings show that CSE sensitizes human macrophages to cell death by promoting pyroptotic and apoptotic pathways upon encountering LPS. We propose that while the delayed inflammatory response may result in ineffective defenses against infections, the observed cell death associated with DAMP release may contribute to establish chronic inflammation. CS exposure sensitizes human macrophages to pro-inflammatory cell death. Upon exposure to LPS, CS inhibits the TLR4/MyD88 inflammatory response, downregulating the pro-inflammatory genes TNF and IL6 and the anti-apoptotic gene CFLAR, known to counteract caspase-8 activity. CS enhances caspase-8 activation through TLR4/TRIF, with a partial involvement of RIPK1, resulting on the activation of caspase-1/GSDMD axis leading to increased cell permeability and DAMP release through gasdermin pores [19]. At later timepoints caspase-3 becomes strongly activated by caspase-8 triggering apoptotic events which are associated with mitochondrial membrane depolarization, gasdermin E cleavage and secondary necrosis with consequent massive DAMP release.",

        "abstract": "Naturally occurring protein switches have been repurposed for the development of biosensors and reporters for cellular and clinical applications1. However, the number of such switches is limited, and reengineering them is challenging. Here we show that a general class of protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which the binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest2. The designed sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state and an open luminescent state; analyte binding drives the switch from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor is based on the thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We create biosensors that can sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the HER2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac troponin I and an anti-hepatitis B virus antibody with the high sensitivity required to detect these molecules clinically. Given the need for diagnostic tools to track the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)3, we used the approach to design sensors for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antibodies against the membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. The former, which incorporates a de novo designed spike receptor binding domain (RBD) binder4, has a limit of detection of 15 pM and a luminescence signal 50-fold higher than the background level. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes, and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.",

By identifying proteins with narrow functional roles in the brain (i.e., behavioral control), we can develop drugs targeting these proteins for improved treatment safety and efficacy. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We focused on an evolutionarily new, non-neuronal, non-synaptic glutamate signaling mechanism, system xc- (Sxc). Sxc activity was eliminated by mutating the gene Slc7a11 through pronuclear injection of zinc-finger nucleases into Sprague Dawley rat embryos to create a line of rats lacking Sxc (MSxc). To confirm Sxc mutation, we verified that tissue from MSxc rats had a complete lack of xCT, which is the regulatory subunit of Sxc that is encoded by Slc7a11. We also verified that astrocyte cultures generated from MSxc tissue lacked cystine-evoked glutamate release. Next, we measured development (body weight), CNS regulation of metabolism, and other indicators of generalized, non-specific brain function as well as behaviors that are reliant on behavioral control, such as impulse control and response inhibition. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Eliminating Sxc was not lethal and did not impair development or produce widespread changes in brain function as is commonly observed when deleting other glutamate mechanisms. MSxc rats did not differ from wildtype in growth rate, central regulation of metabolism as reflected by absolute or diurnal changes in core body temperature, locomotor activity in a familiar or novel environment, or simple forms of cognition such as novel object recognition, or operant responding (food and cocaine-reinforced). In contrast, behaviors that rely on behavioral control were impaired. MSxc rats displayed deficits in impulse control and behavioral flexibility. We hypothesize that MSxc rats will also show deficits in response inhibition using the stop signal reaction time task, a common metric used in clinical populations. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Eliminating Sxc activity in rats produced deficits in behaviors reliant on impulse control, without impacting development or simple brain function. These results show the potential of targeting Sxc to restore behavioral control without generating therapeutically limiting adverse effects resulting from non-specific changes in brain function.",

Proteins are made up of chains of amino acids and the folding process is exquisitely complex. When this folding process is inhibited, the respective protein is referred to as being misfolded and nonfunctional. So the hypothesis that follows is in regard to the diseases that are caused by the misfolding of vital proteins and their reported relationship with thiamin metabolism. These diseases are termed proteopathies and there are at least 50 different conditions in which the mechanism is importantly related to a misfolded protein. In the brain, thiamin deficiency causes a cascade of events involving mild impairment of oxidative metabolism, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, including the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, all of which are examples of proteopathies. Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders related to the conformational alteration of the prion protein (PrP C) into a pathogenic and protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc). The physiological form (PrP C) is a cell surface glycoprotein expressed mainly in the central nervous system. Despite numerous efforts to elucidate its role, the exact biological function remains unknown. Prion-induced diseases, due to the conformational change in the protein, are a global health problem, with lack of effective therapy and 100% mortality. Thiamin and its derivatives bind the prion protein and intermolecular actions have been noted between thiamin and other thiamin-binding proteins, although the exact importance of this is conjectural.",

Using a combination of computation and experiment, we designed a hyperstable 40-residue miniprotein, PD-MP1, that specifically binds murine and human PD-1 at the PD-L1 interface with a Kd of ∼100 nM. The apo crystal structure shows that the binder folds as designed with a backbone RMSD of 1.3 Å to the design model. Trimerization of PD-MP1 resulted in a PD-1 agonist that strongly inhibits murine T cell activation.

        "abstract": "Allosteric regulation of protein function is widespread in biology, but is challenging for de novo protein design as it requires the explicit design of multiple states with comparable free energies. Here we explore the possibility of designing switchable protein systems de novo, through the modulation of competing inter- and intramolecular interactions. We design a static, five-helix 'cage' with a single interface that can interact either intramolecularly with a terminal 'latch' helix or intermolecularly with a peptide 'key'. Encoded on the latch are functional motifs for binding, degradation or nuclear export that function only when the key displaces the latch from the cage. We describe orthogonal cage-key systems that function in vitro, in yeast and in mammalian cells with up to 40-fold activation of function by key. The ability to design switchable protein functions that are controlled by induced conformational change is a milestone for de novo protein design, and opens up new avenues for synthetic biology and cell engineering.",

        "abstract": "In biology, beta-barrels, cylindrically rolled-up forms of beta-sheets, are ubiquitous structural motifs within various binding proteins, pores, and enzymes. This biological multifunctionality suggested that synthetic artificial beta-barrels would provide access to many different functions beyond the limitations of peptide chemistry. Unlike the relative ease of formation of synthetic (de novo) alpha-helix bundles, the synthesis of artificial beta-barrels remains a challenge. To bypass the folding problems involved, we have employed \"unfoldable\" rigid-rod scaffolds as privileged staves (staves are the wood strips that form the sides of macroscopic barrels); the resulting barrel-stave supramolecules exhibit their expected multifunctionality. Several \"rigid rod\" beta-barrels that act as receptors, ion channels, pores, catalysts, and sensors have been prepared and studied. The most recent topic of interest concerns the use of artificial beta-barrels as multicomponent sensors (\"artificial tongues\") in complex analyte matrices. For multicomponent sensing, we have designed artificial beta-barrels to form pores that can open and close in response to chemical stimulation within lipid bilayers. With use of fluorogenic vesicles, changes in pore activity are readily detectable with either the naked eye or multiwell screening formats. The varying responsiveness to substrates and products makes synthetic pores versatile detectors of chemical reactions, of the activity of the enzymes that catalyze these reactions, and of their inhibitors. In sensing applications, the \"perfect\" selectivity of enzymes is exploited to generate analyte-specific signals. Reactive signal amplifiers are then covalently linked to the products of enzymatic signal generation to enhance their pore blockage potency. With the help of signal generators and amplifiers, we have employed artificial beta-barrel pores to sense sweet (sucrose, lactose), sour (acetate, lactate, citrate), and umami (\"deliciousness\", glutamate) components in various food samples. This breakthrough naturally led us to design and synthesize refined pores for advanced sensing applications. We have developed methods to build guest-binding sites not only at internal and external barrel surfaces but also near the core or near the periphery of the pore. Further refinements include the introduction of asymmetric staves for voltage gating and anchoring of the pore at the membrane-water interface.",

The expert group provide a narrative synthesis of the scientific background relating to these topics based on their knowledge and experience of the scientific research literature, as well as practical experience of applying knowledge within an elite sports setting.

This method is sufficiently rapid to enable the systematic enumeration of cyclically docked arrangements of a monomer followed by sequence design of the newly formed interfaces. We use this method to design interfaces onto idealized repeat proteins that direct their assembly into complexes that possess cyclic symmetry. Of 96 designs that were characterized experimentally, 21 were found to form stable monodisperse homo-oligomers in solution, and 15 (four homodimers, six homotrimers, six homotetramers and one homopentamer) had solution small-angle X-ray scattering data consistent with the design models.

However, spontaneous agglomeration of the film produces randomly distributed and non-uniform nanostructures that must be controlled.

Regardless of the film thickness, Ag films dewet faster than Au films and produce spherical NPs, compared to faceted Au NPs, with broader size distribution. Whereas, by the SSD of Au-Ag bilayer ultrathin films, highly spherical and monodisperse AuAg bimetallic NPs can be fabricated.

Nutrition and hydration influence injury and illness risk. Objective To determine how nutrient and fluid intake can minimise the risk of injury and illness and promote physical health through sport and exercise participation. We hypothesised that appropriate nutritional status would help to minimise the risk of acute and chronic injury and illness. Methods Phase 1) a review of consensus, position statements and review articles; phase 2) key themes identified in phase 1 (injury themes n=2, acute illness themes n=4) informed a narrative review of research articles. An electronic search for literature published before July 2020 from five databases was conducted for each theme. Results and Discussion Fifty‐three articles informed phase 1 and 44 articles informed phase 2. Empirical research (phase 2) offered limited practical advice for nutritious whole‐food diet and placed greater focus on dietary supplements. Practical diet advice with increased scientific grounding is required for athletes and exercisers. Nutrition and hydration intake should be tailored to the needs of the athlete, baseline nutrition and hydration status, the environment and the demands of the sport. Whole, relatively unprocessed foods are nutrient‐dense and contain a variety of micronutrients not available in  a  single  nutrient  supplement.  Dietary  supplementation  is  only  recommended  if  particular  needs  have  been identified, e.g. restricted diet due to food allergy and should only be taken under medical supervision.",

Despite this progress, a general deep-learning framework for protein design that enables solution of a wide range of design challenges, including de novo binder design and design of higher-order symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion models10,11 have had considerable success in image and language generative modelling but limited success when applied to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry and sequence-structure relationships. Here we show that by fine-tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the design of diverse functional proteins from simple molecular specifications.",

        "abstract": "Individuals who carry the apolipoprotein E ε4 polymorphism have an increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. However, because possession of the ε4 allele confers an increased risk for the diagnosis of dementia, it has proven problematic in older individuals to dissociate the influence of ε4 on cognitive capacity per se as distinct from its influence on clinical diagnostic status. We report a statistical approach that attempts to partial out the influence of diagnostic group membership (Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, healthy control) from the influence of apolipoprotein ε4 genetic status on cognitive functioning. The cognitive phenotype hypothesis predicts that ε4-positive individuals will show cognitive deficits (relative to matched ε4-negative individuals) independent of the development of Alzheimer's disease. By contrast, the prodromal/preclinical Alzheimer's disease hypothesis proposes that the effect of apolipoprotein E status on cognitive performance is a function of the increased risk of dementia in individuals with the ε4 allele. We evaluated these hypotheses in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle cohort (n = 1112). We first determined whether previously reported findings concerning ε4 status and age-related neuropsychological performance could be explained by the inadvertent recruitment of people with mild cognitive impairment into the healthy control group. We then tested each diagnostic group in isolation to identify any neuropsychological patterns that may be attributed to the ε4 allele. Finally, as interactions between the ε4 allele and age have previously been reported in cognitive functioning within healthy elderly populations, we attempted to determine whether the inclusion of mild cognitively impaired individuals in the sample may drive this relationship. An extensive battery of standardized, well-validated neuropsychological tasks was administered to a final sample of 764 healthy control subjects, 131 individuals with mild cognitive impairment and 168 individuals with Alzheimer's disease. The effect of the ε4 allele on cognitive performance was assessed using a statistical mediation analysis and supplemented with Bayesian methods to address a number of the limitations associated with Fisherian/Neyman-Pearsonian significance testing. Our findings support the prodromal/preclinical Alzheimer's disease hypothesis and do not support the concept of a distinctive ε4-related cognitive phenotype.",

The present study aimed to investigate the association between dyslexia and exposure to the three classes of insecticides, as well as explore the potential role of oxidative stress in the association. A total of 355 dyslexic children and 390 controls were included in this study. The exposure biomarkers were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Specifically, the exposure biomarkers included three typical metabolites of OPPs, three of PYRs, and nine of NNIs. Additionally, three typical oxidative stress biomarkers, namely, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) for DNA damage, 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG) for RNA damage, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-mercapturic acid (HNEMA) for lipid peroxidation were measured. The detection frequencies of the urinary biomarkers ranged from 83.9% to 100%. Among the target metabolites of the insecticides, a significant association was observed between urinary 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy, the metabolite of chlorpyrifos, an OPP insecticide) and dyslexia. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, children in the highest quartile of TCPy levels had an increased odds of dyslexia (odds ratio [OR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03, 2.75] in comparison to those in the lowest quartile. Among the three oxidative stress biomarkers, urinary HNEMA concentration showed a significant relationship with dyslexia. Children in the highest quartile of HNEMA levels demonstrated an increased dyslexic odds in comparison to those in the lowest quartile after multiple adjustments (OR, 1.64; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.65). Mediation analysis indicated a significant effect of HNEMA in the association between urinary TCPy and dyslexia, with an estimate of 17.2% (P < 0.01).

        "abstract": "S/GOALS: Lack of blood vessels remains a major obstacle in tissue regeneration. Angiopoietin 1 and 2 modulate angiogenesis through the Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase. Ang1 activates pAKT to promote endothelial cell survival while Ang2 antagonizes these effects. We aim to dissect the Ang/Tie2 pathway to uncover the molecular basis for these opposing effects. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Ang1 and Ang2 bind Tie2 via nearly identical F-domains (Fd). To investigate the molecular basis regulating the Tie2 pathway, we generated a series of computationally designed self-assembling protein scaffolds presenting F-domains in a wide range of valencies and geometries using Rosette Molecular Modeling Suite. We examined the protein kinase activation, cell migration, and blood vessel formation produced by the designed proteins in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Two phenotypic classes were demonstrated by the number of presented F domains: scaffolds presenting 3 or 4 Fd have Ang2 like activity, upregulating pFAK and pERK but not pAKT and failing to induce cell migration and tube formation; scaffolds presenting more than 6 Fd have Ang1 like activity, upregulating the three signaling branches and enhancing cell migration and tube formation. Scaffolds with 8 or more Fd show superagonist activity, producing significantly stronger phenotypes than Ang1. These results suggest that Fd valency largely determines Ang1 vs Ang2 signaling outcomes, and our designed superagonists can outperform Ang1 in vascularization and wound healing. In in vivo experiments, nanoparticles displaying 60 copies of Fd produce significant revascularization in hemorrhagic brains. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Targeting the Tie2 pathway is a new paradigm in regenerative medicine. Our designed constructs will enable us to generate high-affinity Tie2 agonists and antagonists as drugs to control angiogenesis, enabling tissue regeneration that recapitulates the biological architecture of the native tissue physiology, improving organ transplant outcome.",

Here, we provide a whole-genome low-coverage sequencing approach to detect BCA events independent of knowing the affected regions and with low false positives. First, six samples containing BCAs were used to establish a detection protocol and assess the efficacy of different library construction approaches. By clustering anomalous read pairs and filtering out the false-positive results with a control cohort and the concomitant mapping information, we could directly detect BCA events for each sample. Through optimizing the read depth, BCAs in all samples could be blindly detected with only 120 million read pairs per sample for data from a small-insert library and 30 million per sample for data from nonsize-selected mate-pair library. This approach was further validated using another 13 samples that contained BCAs.

        "abstract": "Transmembrane channels and pores have key roles in fundamental biological processes1 and in biotechnological applications such as DNA nanopore sequencing2-4, resulting in considerable interest in the design of pore-containing proteins. Synthetic amphiphilic peptides have been found to form ion channels5,6, and there have been recent advances in de novo membrane protein design7,8 and in redesigning naturally occurring channel-containing proteins9,10. However, the de novo design of stable, well-defined transmembrane protein pores that are capable of conducting ions selectively or are large enough to enable the passage of small-molecule fluorophores remains an outstanding challenge11,12. Here we report the computational design of protein pores formed by two concentric rings of α-helices that are stable and monodisperse in both their water-soluble and their transmembrane forms. Crystal structures of the water-soluble forms of a 12-helical pore and a 16-helical pore closely match the computational design models. Patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments show that, when expressed in insect cells, the transmembrane form of the 12-helix pore enables the passage of ions across the membrane with high selectivity for potassium over sodium; ion passage is blocked by specific chemical modification at the pore entrance. When incorporated into liposomes using in vitro protein synthesis, the transmembrane form of the 16-helix pore-but not the 12-helix pore-enables the passage of biotinylated Alexa Fluor 488. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the 16-helix transmembrane pore closely matches the design model. The ability to produce structurally and functionally well-defined transmembrane pores opens the door to the creation of designer channels and pores for a wide variety of applications.",

Unexpectedly, without modifications by functional ligands, OA nanomicelles significantly activate cellular proteasome function by directly binding to 20S proteasome subunit alpha 6 (PSMA6). Mechanism study reveals that OA nanomicelles interact with PSMA6 to dynamically modulate its N-terminal domain conformation change, thereby controlling the entry of proteins into 20S proteasome. Subsequently, OA nanomicelles accelerate the degradation of several crucial proteins, thus potently driving cancer cell pyroptosis. For translational medicine, OA nanomicelles exhibit a significant anticancer potential in tumor-bearing mouse models and stimulate immune cell infiltration.

By designing and creating nanometer scale artificial light harvesting and charge separating proteins, we have the opportunity to reengineer and overcome the limitations of natural selection to extend energy capture to new wavelengths and to tailor efficient systems that better meet human as opposed to cellular energetic needs. While tetrapyrrole cofactor incorporation in natural proteins is complex and often assisted by accessory proteins for cofactor transport and insertion, artificial protein functionalization relies on a practical understanding of the basic physical chemistry of protein and cofactors that drive nanometer scale self-assembly. Patterning and balancing of hydrophobic and hydrophilic tetrapyrrole substituents is critical to avoid natural or synthetic porphyrin and chlorin aggregation in aqueous media and speed cofactor partitioning into the non-polar core of a man-made water soluble protein designed according to elementary first principles of protein folding. This partitioning is followed by site-specific anchoring of tetrapyrroles to histidine ligands strategically placed for design control of rates and efficiencies of light energy and electron transfer while orienting at least one polar group towards the aqueous phase.",

As a proof of principle of the ability to monitor reactions that result in a change in substrate charge, polymerization on a single DNA template was detected. A custom oligonucleotide was synthesized that allowed for the attachment of single DNA templates to gold nanoparticles with a single polymer tether. The nanoparticles were then tethered to the surface of a microfluidic channel where the positions of the nanoparticles, subjected to an oscillating electric field, were monitored using dark field microscopy. With short averaging times, the signal-to-noise level was low enough to discriminate changes in charge of less than 1.2%. Polymerization of a long DNA template demonstrated the ability to use the system to monitor single-molecule enzymatic activity.

Diffusion models10,11 have had considerable success in image and language generative modelling but limited success when applied to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry and sequence-structure relationships.

We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the design model.

Although all of these processes consume energy4,5, it is unknown whether and how cells adapt their metabolic activity to variable mechanical cues. Here we report that the transfer of human bronchial epithelial cells from stiff to soft substrates causes a downregulation of glycolysis via proteasomal degradation of the rate-limiting metabolic enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK). PFK degradation is triggered by the disassembly of stress fibres, which releases the PFK-targeting E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif (TRIM)-containing protein 21 (TRIM21). Transformed non-small-cell lung cancer cells, which maintain high glycolytic rates regardless of changing environmental mechanics, retain PFK expression by downregulating TRIM21, and by sequestering residual TRIM21 on a stress-fibre subset that is insensitive to substrate stiffness. Our data reveal a mechanism by which glycolysis responds to architectural features of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thus coupling cell metabolism to the mechanical properties of the surrounding tissue. These processes enable normal cells to tune energy production in variable microenvironments, whereas the resistance of the cytoskeleton in response to mechanical cues enables the persistence of high glycolytic rates in cancer cells despite constant alterations of the tumour tissue.",

The refined algorithm generates proteins that remain folded at high temperatures and exhibit more pocket diversity than naturally occurring NTF2-like proteins.

        "abstract": "The relationship between structure and function has long been one of the major points of investigation in Biophysics. Understanding how much, or how little, of a protein's often complicated structure is necessary for its function can lead to directed therapeutic strategies and would allow one to design proteins for specific desired functions. Studying protein function by de novo design builds the functionality from the ground up in a completely unrelated and noncoded protein scaffold. Our lab has used this strategy to study heavy and transition metal binding within the TRI family of three stranded coiled coil (3SCC) constructs to understand coordination geometry and metalloenzyme catalytic control within a protein environment. These peptides contain hydrophobic layers within the interior of the 3SCC, which one can mutate to metal binding residues to create a minimal metal binding site, while solid phase synthesis allows our lab to easily incorporate a number of noncoded amino acids including d enantiomers of binding or secondary coordination sphere amino acids, penicillamine, or methylated versions of histidine. Our studies of Cd(II) binding to Cys3 environments have determined, largely through the use of 113Cd NMR and 111mCd PAC, that the coordination environment around a heavy metal can be controlled by incorporating noncoded amino acids in either the primary or secondary coordination spheres. We found mutating the metal binding amino acids to l-Pen can enforce trigonal Cd(II)S3 geometry exclusively compared to the mixed coordination determined for l-Cys coordination. The same result can be achieved with secondary sphere mutations as well by incorporating d-Leu above a Cys3. We hypothesize this latter effect is due to the increased steric packing above the metal binding site that occurs when the l-Leu oriented toward the N-terminus of the scaffold is mutated to d-Leu and oriented toward the C-terminus. Mutating the layer below Cys3 to d-Leu instead formed a mixed 4- and 5-coordinate Cd(II)S3(H2O) and Cd(II)S3(H2O)2 construct as steric bulk was decreased below the metal binding site. We have also applied noncoded amino acids to metalloenzyme systems by incorporating His residues that are methylated at the δ- or ε-nitrogen to enforce Cu(I) ligation to the opposite open nitrogen of His and found a 2 orders of magnitude increased catalytic efficiency for nitrite reductase activity with ε-nitrogen coordination compared to δ-nitrogen. These results exemplify the ability to tune coordination environment and catalytic efficiency within a de novo scaffold as well as the utility of noncoded amino acids to increase the chemist's toolbox. By furthering our understanding of metalloprotein design one could envision, through our use of amino acids not normally available to nature, that protein design laboratories will soon be capable of outperforming the native systems previously used as their benchmark of successful design. The ability to design proteins at this level would have far reaching and exciting benefits within various fields including medical and industrial applications.",

The power of self-assembly makes it the ubiquitous strategy of living organized matter and provides a powerful tool to chemists. However, a challenging issue in the self-assembly of complex supramolecular structures is to understand how kinetically efficient pathways emerge from the multitude of possible transition states and routes. Unfortunately, very few systems provide an intelligible structure and formation mechanism on which new models can be developed. Here, we elucidate the molecular and supramolecular self-assembly mechanism of synthetic octapeptide into nanotubes in equilibrium conditions. Their complex hierarchical self-assembly has recently been described at the mesoscopic level, and we show now that this system uniquely exhibits three assembly stages and three intermediates: (i) a peptide dimer is evidenced by both analytical centrifugation and NMR translational diffusion experiments; (ii) an open ribbon and (iii) an unstable helical ribbon are both visualized by transmission electron microscopy and characterized by small angle X-ray scattering. Interestingly, the structural features of two stable intermediates are related to the final nanotube organization as they set, respectively, the nanotube wall thickness and the final wall curvature radius.

Our findings suggests that the rational design of oligopeptides can encode both molecular- and macro-scale morphological characteristics of their higher-order assemblies, thus opening the way to ultrahigh resolution peptide scaffold engineering.",

In rodents, the weight-reducing effects of MEDI0382 are superior to those of the GLP-1 analogue, liraglutide. The current study characterised the activation of distinct neuroanatomical areas following peripheral administration of MEDI0382, relative to liraglutide and the glucagon receptor agonist, G1432. C57Blk6 mice were fasted for 4 h and then injected with a single dose (3 nmol/kg; s.c) of test agent or vehicle (n=4 each). After 2 h, mice were sacrificed and brains were dissected out and immersion-fixed in formalin (24-48 h). The brains were then cut into 3 mm serial slices and processed to paraffin blocks. Each block was sectioned entirely, sampling a 4µm step section every 100µm. Each section was immunohistochemically stained for c-fos, using a rabbit anti-fos polyclonal, with haematoxylin counterstain. Stained sections were digitally scanned at 20x magnification (Aperio AT2). The appropriate brain sections containing the area postrema (AP), the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), and the hypothalamic parabrachial (PBN) and arcuate nuclei were selected. These areas were manually delimited using the online Allen mouse brain atlas. The number of positive and negative nuclei were automatically counted (Halo), and reported as % of total positive cells and number of cells per tissue area. MEDI0382 significantly increased c-fos activation in the AP and NTS vs. vehicle, whereas liraglutide and G1432 showed no difference from vehicle. There was no significant increase in c-fos activation in the arcuate nucleus or PBN in any treatment group when compared to vehicle. In summary, the neuronal activation by MEDI0382 shows that distinct differences were observed compared to GLP-1 and glucagon agonists alone, suggesting that a different pattern of activation exists for the dual agonist, MEDI0382 vs. the monotherapies.

In light of past successes in the transformation of antibacterial kanamycin into antifungal derivatives via chemical modifications, a new library of kanamycin-azole hybrids was synthesized and tested against a panel of azole-resistant and susceptible Candida and Cryptococcus strains. Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed pivotal roles for antifungal activity of the azole ring (imidazole vs triazole) and halogen substituents on the benzene ring (F vs Cl). Most notably, hybrids 13, 14 and 15 were active against resistant C. albicans, C. tropicalis and C. neoformans strains and non-toxic towards mammalian cells.

In order to elucidate these, we here investigate effects of nanoparticle charge and porosity on AMP loading and release, as well as consequences of this for membrane interactions and antimicrobial effects. Anionic mesoporous silica particles were found to incorporate considerable amounts of the cationic AMP LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES (LL-37), whereas loading is much lower for non-porous or positively charged silica nanoparticles. Due to preferential pore localization, anionic mesoporous particles, but not the other particles, protect LL-37 from degradation by infection-related proteases. For anionic mesoporous nanoparticles, membrane disruption is mediated almost exclusively by peptide release. In contrast, non-porous silica particles build up a resilient LL-37 surface coating due to their higher negative surface charge, and display largely particle-mediated membrane interactions and antimicrobial effects. For positively charged mesoporous silica nanoparticles, LL-37 incorporation promotes the membrane binding and disruption displayed by the particles in the absence of peptide, but also causes toxicity against human erythrocytes. Thus, the use of mesoporous silica nanoparticles as AMP delivery systems requires consideration of membrane interactions and selectivity of both free peptide and the peptide-loaded nanoparticles, the latter critically dependent on nanoparticle properties.",

Despite the development of extremely powerful multivalent binders of the Influenza virus and other viruses, comparably little is known about the optimal spacing of HA ligands, which ought to bridge binding sites within or across the trimeric HA molecules. To explore the criteria for ligand economical high affinity binding, we systematically probed distance-affinity relationships by means of two differently behaving scaffold types based on (i) flexible polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugates and (ii) rigid self-assembled DNA·PNA complexes. The bivalent scaffolds presented two sialyl-LacNAc ligands in 23-101 Å distance. A combined analysis of binding by means of microscale thermophoresis measurements and statistical mechanics models exposed the inherent limitations of PEG-based spacers. Given the distance requirements of HA, the flexibility of PEG scaffolds is too high to raise the effective concentration of glyco ligands above a value that allows interactions with the low affinity binding site. By contrast, spatial screening with less flexible, self-assembled peptide nucleic acid (PNA)·DNA complexes uncovered a well-defined and, surprisingly, bimodal distance-affinity relationship for interactions of the Influenza A virus HA with bivalent displays of the natural sialyl-LacNAc ligand. Optimal constructs conferred 103-fold binding enhancements with only two ligands. We discuss the existence of secondary binding sites and shine light on the preference for intramolecular rather than intermolecular recognition of HA trimers on the virus surface.",

The Au-Ag incorporated TiO2 photoanode demonstrated an enhanced solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency of 7.33%, which is ∼230% higher than the unmodified TiO2 photoanode (2.22%) under full sunlight illumination (100 mW cm-2, AM 1.5G). This superior solar energy conversion efficiency was mainly due to the synergistic effect between the Au and Ag, and their surface plasmon resonance effect, which improved the optical absorption and interfacial charge transfer by minimizing the charge recombination process. The influence of the Au-Ag composition on the overall energy conversion efficiency was also explored, and the optimized composition with TiO2 was found to be Au75-Ag25. This was reflected in the femtosecond transient absorption dynamics in which the electron-phonon interaction in the Au nanoparticles was measured to be 6.14 ps in TiO2/Au75:Ag25, compared to 2.38 ps for free Au and 4.02 ps for TiO2/Au100:Ag0. The slower dynamics indicates a more efficient electron-hole separation in TiO2/Au75:Ag25 that is attributed to the formation of a Schottky barrier at the interface between TiO2 and the noble metal(s) that acts as an electron sink. The significant boost in the solar energy conversion efficiency with the Au-Ag@TiO2 plasmonic nanocomposite showed its potential as a photoanode for high-efficiency DSSCs.",

To improve the contiguities of these assemblies, we generated BioNano Genomics optical mapping and Dovetail Genomics chromosome conformation capture data for genome scaffolding. Despite their technical differences, optical mapping and chromosome conformation capture performed similarly and doubled N50 values. After improving both integration methods, assembly contiguity reached chromosome-arm-levels. We rigorously assessed the quality of contigs and scaffolds using Illumina mate-pair libraries and genetic map information. This showed that PacBio assemblies have high sequence accuracy but can contain several misassemblies, which join unlinked regions of the genome. Most, but not all, of these misjoints were removed during the integration of the optical mapping and chromosome conformation capture data.

The WHO estimates that annual epidemics of influenza result in ~1 billion infections, 3–5 million cases of severe illness and 300,000–500,000 deaths. The severity of pandemic influenza depends on multiple factors, including the virulence of the pandemic virus strain and the level of pre-existing immunity. The most severe influenza pandemic, in 1918, resulted in >40 million deaths worldwide. Influenza vaccines are formulated every year to match the circulating strains, as they evolve antigenically owing to antigenic drift. Nevertheless, vaccine efficacy is not optimal and is dramatically low in the case of an antigenic mismatch between the vaccine and the circulating virus strain. Antiviral agents that target the influenza virus enzyme neuraminidase have been developed for prophylaxis and therapy. However, the use of these antivirals is still limited. Emerging approaches to combat influenza include the development of universal influenza virus vaccines that provide protection against antigenically distant influenza viruses, but these vaccines need to be tested in clinical trials to ascertain their effectiveness.",

HTS in this company (Pfizer, Groton, USA) had its origin in natural products screening in 1986, by substituting fermentation broths with dimethyl sulphoxide solutions of synthetic compounds, using 96-well plates and reduced assay volumes of 50-100 microl. A nominal 30 mM source compound concentration provided high microM assay concentrations. Starting at 800 compounds each week, the process reached a steady state of 7200 compounds per week by 1989. Screening in the Applied Biotechnology and Screening Group was centralized with screens operating in lock-step to maximize efficiency. Initial screens were full files run in triplicate. Autoradiography and image analysis were introduced for (125)I receptor ligand screens. Reverse transcriptase (RT) coupled with quantitative PCR and multiplexing addressed several targets in a single assay. By 1992 HTS produced 'hits' as starting matter for approximately 40% of the Discovery portfolio. In 1995, the HTS methodology was expanded to include ADMET targets. ADME targets required each compound to be physically detected leading to the development of automated high throughput LC-MS. In 1996, 90 compounds/week were screened in microsomal, protein binding and serum stability assays. Subsequently, the mutagenic Ames assay was adapted to a 96-well plate liquid assay and novel algorithms permitted automated image analysis of the micronucleus assay. By 1999 ADME HTS was fully integrated into the discovery cycle.",

        "abstract": "Plasmodium parasites, the causative agents of malaria, have evolved a unique cell division cycle in the clinically relevant asexual blood stage of infection1. DNA replication commences approximately halfway through the intracellular development following invasion and parasite growth. The schizont stage is associated with multiple rounds of DNA replication and nuclear division without cytokinesis, resulting in a multinucleated cell. Nuclei divide asynchronously through schizogony, with only the final round of DNA replication and segregation being synchronous and coordinated with daughter cell assembly2,3. However, the control mechanisms for this divergent mode of replication are unknown. Here, we show that the Plasmodium-specific kinase PfCRK4 is a key cell-cycle regulator that orchestrates multiple rounds of DNA replication throughout schizogony in Plasmodium falciparum. PfCRK4 depletion led to a complete block in nuclear division and profoundly inhibited DNA replication. Quantitative phosphoproteomic profiling identified a set of PfCRK4-regulated phosphoproteins with greatest functional similarity to CDK2 substrates, particularly proteins involved in the origin of replication firing. PfCRK4 was required for initial and subsequent rounds of DNA replication during schizogony and, in addition, was essential for development in the mosquito vector. Our results identified an essential S-phase promoting factor of the unconventional P. falciparum cell cycle. PfCRK4 is required for both a prolonged period of the intraerythrocytic stage of Plasmodium infection, as well as for transmission, revealing a broad window for PfCRK4-targeted chemotherapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Approximately 22% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients suffer from seizures, and the co-occurrence of seizures and epileptiform activity exacerbates AD pathology and related cognitive deficits, suggesting that seizures may be a targetable component of AD progression. Given that alterations in neuronal excitatory:inhibitory (E:I) balance occur in epilepsy, we hypothesized that decreased markers of inhibition relative to those of excitation would be present in AD patients. We similarly hypothesized that in 5XFAD mice, the E:I imbalance would progress from an early stage (prodromal) to later symptomatic stages and be further exacerbated by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling. Post-mortem AD temporal cortical tissues from patients with or without seizure history were examined for changes in several markers of E:I balance, including levels of the inhibitory GABAA receptor, the sodium potassium chloride cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) and potassium chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2) and the excitatory NMDA and AMPA type glutamate receptors. We performed patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings from CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices and examined the same markers of E:I balance in prodromal 5XFAD mice. We next examined 5XFAD mice at chronic stages, after PTZ or control protocols, and in response to chronic mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, administered following kindled seizures, for markers of E:I balance. We found that AD patients with comorbid seizures had worsened cognitive and functional scores and decreased GABAA receptor subunit expression, as well as increased NKCC1/KCC2 ratios, indicative of depolarizing GABA responses. Patch clamp recordings of prodromal 5XFAD CA1 neurons showed increased intrinsic excitability, along with decreased GABAergic inhibitory transmission and altered glutamatergic neurotransmission, indicating that E:I imbalance may occur in early disease stages. Furthermore, seizure induction in prodromal 5XFAD mice led to later dysregulation of NKCC1/KCC2 and a reduction in GluA2 AMPA glutamate receptor subunit expression, indicative of depolarizing GABA receptors and calcium permeable AMPA receptors. Finally, we found that chronic treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin, at doses we have previously shown to attenuate seizure-induced amyloid-β pathology and cognitive deficits, could also reverse elevations of the NKCC1/KCC2 ratio in these mice. Our data demonstrate novel mechanisms of interaction between AD and epilepsy and indicate that targeting E:I balance, potentially with US Food and Drug Administration-approved mTOR inhibitors, hold therapeutic promise for AD patients with a seizure history.",

        "abstract": "osuppressive nature of cancer prevents a sustained response to T-cell-inducing vaccines. We hypothesize that co-delivering antigens and adjuvants directly to sub-compartments of antigen presenting cells could elicit specific CTL and Th1 activation, providing more control over the immune response. To accomplish this goal, we are developing protein nanoparticles capable of delivering payloads consisting of RNA, protein, and small molecules to target cells. One class of protein nanoparticles is produced in E. coli and is capable of packaging its own RNA to enable evolution of improved functions such as increased RNA packaging, improved serum stability, and pH-mediated disassembly for endosomal payload delivery. Another class of protein nanoparticles can bud from HEK293F cells containing small molecule adjuvants and mRNA-encoded antigens. By pseudotyping these enveloped protein nanoparticles with viral fusion proteins, we can deliver nucleic acids to the cytosol of target cells where they are translated to produce the desired protein antigen. These non-viral delivery devices could improve our ability to control immune responses against cancer. Citation Format: Marc J.

Current state-of-the-art computational design methods typically rely on existing small molecule binding sites or protein scaffolds with existing shape complementarity for a target ligand. Here we introduce new methods that utilize pools of discrete contacts between protein side chains and defined small molecule ligand substructures (ligand fragments) observed in the Protein Data Bank. We use the Rosetta Molecular Modeling Suite to recombine protein side chains in these contact pools to generate hundreds of thousands of energetically favorable binding sites for a target ligand. These composite binding sites are built into existing scaffold proteins matching the intended binding site geometry with high accuracy. In addition, we apply pools of side chain rotamers interacting with the target ligand to augment Rosetta's conventional design machinery and improve key metrics known to be predictive of design success. We demonstrate that our method reliably builds diverse binding sites into different scaffold proteins for a variety of target molecules. Our generalizable de novo ligand binding site design method provides a foundation for versatile design of protein to interface previously unattainable molecules for applications in medical diagnostics and synthetic biology.",

        "abstract": "viruses cause thousands of deaths worldwide and remain a prominent public health issue. Currently, the influenza vaccine is the best tool available at protecting against infection, but the correct strains are hard to predict and the vaccines do not always work. More effective antiviral drugs are needed. Protection against influenza by broadly neutralizing antibodies targeted to a highly conserved region in the hemagglutinin (HA) stem shows great potential for immunotherapy. We have investigated the protective efficacy of an engineered protein, HB36.6, that was computationally designed to bind with high affinity to the same region in the HA stem as targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies. Studies in the mouse model demonstrated that intranasal delivery of HB36.6 affords protection in mice lethally challenged with diverse strains of influenza, both when administered as a single dose of 6.0 mg/kg up to 48 hrs prior to challenge and significantly reduces disease when administered as a daily therapeutic after challenge. The current study was designed to evaluate HB36.6 in the ferret model, comparing prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of this new antiviral against high dose influenza aerosol challenge. Similar to data obtained in the mouse model, results from these studies demonstrated significant reduction in viral load and clinical signs of disease in ferrets treated with HB36.6 compared to untreated controls or ferrets treated with Tamiflu. Together, these results show that binding of HB36.6 to the influenza HA stem region alone was sufficient to reduce the viral infection and disease process in vivo. These studies demonstrate a potential new class of antivirals for influenza.",

We aimed to find out whether some patients are referred for biopsy unnecessarily. We audited all referrals (n=100) made to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery over 34 months, and used the ACR classification to find out whether patients had had a clinical diagnosis of GCA at referral (ACR score: 3 or more). We then compared them with the result of the biopsy. Of the 100 referred, 98 had a biopsy, and of them, 15 were diagnosed with GCA (2 results were not included). Thirteen of the 15 had already been diagnosed clinically (based on the ACR classification) at referral. Our results gave an ACR specificity of 96% (95% CI: 85% to 99%) but only 20% sensitivity (95% CI: 11% to 32%). There was a linear correlation of high ACR scores with histopathological confirmation. Biopsy is most beneficial when there is a degree of diagnostic uncertainty (ACR: 1 or 2), an atypical presentation, or when steroids may be relatively contraindicated. On the basis of our study, we designed a new referral form for biopsy based on the ACR criteria.",

Key challenges relating to CAR T cells include severe toxicities, restricted trafficking to, infiltration into and activation within tumours, suboptimal persistence in vivo, antigen escape and heterogeneity, and manufacturing issues. The evolution of CAR designs beyond the conventional structures will be necessary to address these limitations and to expand the use of CAR T cells to a wider range of malignancies. Investigators are addressing the current obstacles with a wide range of engineering strategies in order to improve the safety, efficacy and applicability of this therapeutic modality.

We begin by defining road rage and other key constructs. We then consider the interplay between road rage generation and road rage regulation. Using an emotion regulation framework, we describe key points at which emotion-regulation difficulties can lead to road rage, followed by strategies that may alleviate these difficulties.

        "abstract": "Attachment of the Influenza A virus onto host cells involves multivalent interactions between virus surface hemagglutinin (HA) and sialoside-containing glyco ligands. Despite the development of extremely powerful multivalent binders of the Influenza virus and other viruses, comparably little is known about the optimal spacing of HA ligands, which ought to bridge binding sites within or across the trimeric HA molecules. To explore the criteria for ligand economical high affinity binding, we systematically probed distance-affinity relationships by means of two differently behaving scaffold types based on (i) flexible polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugates and (ii) rigid self-assembled DNA·PNA complexes. The bivalent scaffolds presented two sialyl-LacNAc ligands in 23-101 Å distance. A combined analysis of binding by means of microscale thermophoresis measurements and statistical mechanics models exposed the inherent limitations of PEG-based spacers. Given the distance requirements of HA, the flexibility of PEG scaffolds is too high to raise the effective concentration of glyco ligands above a value that allows interactions with the low affinity binding site. By contrast, spatial screening with less flexible, self-assembled peptide nucleic acid (PNA)·DNA complexes uncovered a well-defined and, surprisingly, bimodal distance-affinity relationship for interactions of the Influenza A virus HA with bivalent displays of the natural sialyl-LacNAc ligand. Optimal constructs conferred 103-fold binding enhancements with only two ligands. We discuss the existence of secondary binding sites and shine light on the preference for intramolecular rather than intermolecular recognition of HA trimers on the virus surface.",

Astrocytes play an important role in disease progression in the SOD1G93A transgenic mouse model and patients of ALS. Although astrocytes display a selective toxicity to MN, the toxic factor(s) have not been identified. We hypothesise that differential gene expression in SOD1-ALS astrocytes will reveal targets for therapeutic intervention. Microarray analysis was performed upon Laser Capture Microdissected astrocytes isolated from spinal cord of symptomatic (90 day) and late-stage (120 day) SOD1G93A mice and non-transgenic (NTg) littermates, and from post-mortem human SOD1-ALS and control spinal cord. Functional studies were performed using enzymatic activity assays and immunohistochemistry upon spinal cord and in vitro validation studies were performed using murine neonatal cultures of astrocytes, microglia and embryonic MNs and “i-astrocytes” directly converted from human ALS fibroblasts. In murine astrocytes annotation clustering analysis showed increased expression of lysosomal transcripts which were validated by qPCR . Using functional experiments, we have found significantly higher activity of the lysosomal enzyme β hexosamindase in the spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice. Immune response and phagocytic pathways are also enriched within both datasets, and phagocytosis assays using fluorescently labelled NSC34 cell debris show that SOD1G93A astrocytes engulf significantly higher amounts of neuronal debris compared to NTg controls, highlighting an increased reactivity of astrocytes at symptom onset. Human SOD1-astrocytes show down-regulation of transcripts involved in tight junction formation such as ZO-2, Claudin-5 and Occludin, and we hypothesise that ALS-astrocytes contribute to the breakdown in blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity seen in ALS. qPCR confirmed differential expression of BBB-influencing genes such as claudin-5, junctional adhesion molecule 2 and transforming growth factor beta-2. Model BBBs made with i-astrocytes from human patients co-cultured with endothelia show significantly lower transendothelial electrical resistance and dextran-permeability values pointing to an astrocyte role in increased BBB permeability during disease. These studies show the breadth of behaviours displayed by astrocytes during ALS disease progression and will provide an important guide for future therapeutic intervention.",

The extent of the global pandemic due to COVID-19 has a significant impact on our lives that must be studied carefully to combat it. This study highlights the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on crucial aspects of daily life globally, including; Food security, Global economy, Education, Tourism, hospitality, sports and leisure, Gender Relation, Domestic Violence/Abuse, Mental Health and Environmental air pollution through a systematic search of the literature. The COVID-19 global lockdown was initiated to stem the spread of the virus and 'flatten the curve' of the pandemic. However, the impact of the lockdown has had far-reaching effects in different strata of life, including; changes in the accessibility and structure of education delivery to students, food insecurity as a result of unavailability and fluctuation in prices, the depression of the global economy, increase in mental health challenges, wellbeing and quality of life amongst others. This review article highlights the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown across the globe. As the global lockdown is being lifted in a phased manner in various countries of the world, it is necessary to explore its impacts to understand its consequences comprehensively. This will guide future decisions that will be made in a possible future wave of the COVID-19 pandemic or other global disease outbreak.",

In 2005, a report by the public/private partnership North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone (NARSTO) evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of North American emissions inventories and made recommendations for improving their effectiveness. This paper reviews the recommendation areas and briefly discusses what has been addressed, what remains unchanged, and new questions that have arisen. The findings reveal that all emissions inventory improvement areas identified by the 2005 NARSTO publication have been explored and implemented to some degree. The U.S. National Emissions Inventory has become more detailed and has incorporated new research into previously under-characterized sources such as fine particles and biomass burning. Additionally, it is now easier to access the emissions inventory and the documentation of the inventory via the internet. However, many emissions-related research needs exist, on topics such as emission estimation methods, speciation, scalable emission factor development, incorporation of new emission measurement techniques, estimation of uncertainty, top-down verification, and analysis of uncharacterized sources. A common theme throughout this retrospective summary is the need for increased coordination among stakeholders. Researchers and inventory developers must work together to ensure that planned emissions research and new findings can be used to update the emissions inventory. To continue to address emissions inventory challenges, industry, the scientific community, and government agencies need to continue to leverage resources and collaborate as often as possible. As evidenced by the progress noted, continued investment in and coordination of emissions inventory activities will provide dividends to air quality management programs across the country, continent, and world. Implications: In 2005, a report by the public/private partnership North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone (NARSTO) evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of North American air pollution emissions inventories. This paper reviews the eight recommendation areas and briefly discusses what has been addressed, what remains unchanged, and new questions that have arisen. Although progress has been made, many opportunities exist for the scientific agencies, industry, and government agencies to leverage resources and collaborate to continue improving emissions inventories.",

        "title": "A New Obesity Model Reveals the Hypophagic Properties of PACAP Involve the Regulation of Homeostatic Feeding in the Ventromedial Hypothalamic Nucleus and Hedonic Feeding in the Nucleus Accumbens",
        "abstract": "ing in humans is a complex disorder that often involves discrete, compulsive feeding sessions of highly palatable foods even in the absence of a deprivation state or hunger. Binging can be effectively modeled in rodents by providing subjects with limited access to a palatable food source (Western Diet; WD) as an adjunct to ad lib access to normal chow (Standard Chow; SC). Although this design recapitulates several fundamental characteristics observed in binge eating disorder, the binge eating observed in this paradigm is likely a product of both hedonic and homeostatic drives with the need to balance energy stores still present. To isolate these feeding drives, we have developed a novel feeding regimen that modifies the classic limited access binge model to effectively delineate and separate homeostatic feeding from motivational feeding. This is achieved by entraining male Sprague-Dawley rats to a restricted feeding schedule (two hours per day) of SC followed by a short 15 minute limited access meal of either SC or WD (Restrict FedLimited Access; RFLA). The RFLA paradigm allows for the examination of pituitary adenylate-cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) on palatable food consumption in a fully satiated subject. PACAP has previously been shown to suppress feeding behavior when injected into the hypothalamus. In the current study, PACAP injected into the ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei (VMN) suppressed the two hour homeostatic SC meal, but not the subsequent 15 minute limited access meal of WD. By contrast, PACAP bilaterally administered into the nucleus accumbens (NAc) produced the opposite effect with PACAP suppressing the consumption of WD but not SC. Thus, PACAP mediated signaling in the VMN appears to be involved in homeostatic regulation of energy stores, whereas PACAP signaling in the NAc regulates feeding driven by palatability or hedonic qualities.

        "abstract": "ction involves heightened relapse vulnerability arising from persistent drug-induced neuro-adaptations, including a) hypofrontality which is thought to reflect reduced firing of cortical afferents to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and b) altered glutamate homeostasis in NAcc that likely involves reduced glutamate release and uptake by astrocytes. An important question is whether these forms of pathological plasticity are functionally linked such that reduced corticostriatal firing may result in aberrant regulation of astrocytes in the NAcc. To begin to evaluate this possibility, we first determined whether neurons regulate system xc(Sxc) activity, a mechanism of non-vesicular glutamate release by astrocytes. We found that the rate of Sxc activity in astrocyte cultures was significantly increased in cells exposed to neuronal conditioned media achieved using neuronal inserts. These experiments demonstrate that releasable neuronal factors significantly upregulate Sxc activity. We hypothesize that the pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) may be the neuronal factor regulating glutamate release by astrocytes involving Sxc. First we determined that PACAP mimics a neuronal insert in that it significantly upregulates Sxc activity in astrocytes. Next, we verified the expression of PACAP in neurons from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) projecting to NAcc. Together, these data support the hypothesis that reduced corticostriatal firing may result in decreased PACAP release in NAcc which could potentially blunt Sxc activity in NAcc astrocytes. To determine whether this would impact relapse vulnerability, we microinjected PACAP into the NAcc and found that this significantly reduced cocaine-primed reinstatement, suggesting that increased PACAP signaling, consistent with other approaches capable of increasing Sxc activity, may blunt relapse vulnerability. In order to determine whether reduced PACAP signaling is sufficient to increase relapse vulnerability, we microinjected the PAC1R inhibitor PACAP6-38 into the NAcc. Preliminary data indicate that this is sufficient to produce an increase in cocaine reinstatement. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that neuropeptide PACAP is a powerful regulator of cocaine-related behaviors, likely through the modulation of glutamate homeostasis as maintained by astrocytes. As a result, an unrecognized consequence of hypofrontality may be impairing neuron-astrocyte interactions in a manner that determines the magnitude of relapse vulnerability. Disclosures: L.

        "abstract": "balance continues to be an issue for many people with only three-out-of-ten people (3.4 million) reporting an improvement in the past five years, according to this report. Introduction Former Prime Minister of Australia John Howard described work/life balance as a \"BBQ-stopper\" in 2001. Since then, the term \"work/life balance\" has been part of the Australian lexicon, but just how well are Australians achieving it? National Go Home on Time Day was launched by The Australia Institute in 2009 as a light-hearted way to start a conversation balance with Australian employees (11.6 million people) about the importance of work/life and the many significant consequences it can have on physical and mental health, relationships and communities. Now in its sixth year, Go Home on Time Day continues to promote such conversations, and this paper seeks to measure: have Australians achieved work/life balance? The finding is that work/life balance continues to be an issue for many people with only three-out-of-ten people (3.4 million) reporting an improvement in the past five years. Furthermore, Australians continue to work large amounts of unpaid overtime. Research conducted for Go Home on Time Day this year found that these ‘donated’ hours added up to 58.8 million hours, which based on the average income adds up to almost $110 billion. If these hours were paid and allocated to Australians looking for work the unemployment rate could be zero. In 2010 Australians were on average working 2.5 hours more a week than they would have liked. Only one-in-five workers reported they were working the hours they would like to. Unsurprisingly, the desire for fewer hours was stronger amongst people working long hours, whereas part-time workers indicated they would like to work more hours.1 The general desire for more work by some and less work by others highlights the need to balance the distribution of work hours across the labour force.",

R-loops, non-B DNA structures formed when nascent RNA hybridizes to DNA to displace the non-template strand as single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), are partially responsible for this instability. Yet, recent work has begun to elucidate regulatory roles for R-loops in maintaining the genome. In this review, we discuss the cellular contexts in which R-loops contribute to genomic instability, particularly during DNA replication and double-strand break (DSB) repair. We also summarize the evidence that R-loops participate as an intermediate during repair and may influence pathway choice to preserve genomic integrity. Finally, we discuss the immunogenic potential of R-loops and highlight their links to disease should they become pathogenic.",

        "abstract": "The ability to design proteins with high affinity and selectivity for any given small molecule is a rigorous test of our understanding of the physiochemical principles that govern molecular recognition. Attempts to rationally design ligand-binding proteins have met with little success, however, and the computational design of protein-small-molecule interfaces remains an unsolved problem. Current approaches for designing ligand-binding proteins for medical and biotechnological uses rely on raising antibodies against a target antigen in immunized animals and/or performing laboratory-directed evolution of proteins with an existing low affinity for the desired ligand, neither of which allows complete control over the interactions involved in binding. Here we describe a general computational method for designing pre-organized and shape complementary small-molecule-binding sites, and use it to generate protein binders to the steroid digoxigenin (DIG). Of seventeen experimentally characterized designs, two bind DIG; the model of the higher affinity binder has the most energetically favourable and pre-organized interface in the design set. A comprehensive binding-fitness landscape of this design, generated by library selections and deep sequencing, was used to optimize its binding affinity to a picomolar level, and X-ray co-crystal structures of two variants show atomic-level agreement with the corresponding computational models. The optimized binder is selective for DIG over the related steroids digitoxigenin, progesterone and β-oestradiol, and this steroid binding preference can be reprogrammed by manipulation of explicitly designed hydrogen-bonding interactions. The computational design method presented here should enable the development of a new generation of biosensors, therapeutics and diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "Molecular docking programs are primarily designed to align rigid, drug-like fragments into the binding sites of macromolecules and frequently display poor performance when applied to flexible carbohydrate molecules. A critical source of flexibility within an oligosaccharide is the glycosidic linkages. Recently, Carbohydrate Intrinsic (CHI) energy functions were reported that attempt to quantify the glycosidic torsion angle preferences. In the present work, the CHI-energy functions have been incorporated into the AutoDock Vina (ADV) scoring function, subsequently termed Vina-Carb (VC). Two user-adjustable parameters have been introduced, namely, a CHI- energy weight term (chi_coeff) that affects the magnitude of the CHI-energy penalty and a CHI-cutoff term (chi_cutoff) that negates CHI-energy penalties below a specified value. A data set consisting of 101 protein-carbohydrate complexes and 29 apoprotein structures was used in the development and testing of VC, including antibodies, lectins, and carbohydrate binding modules. Accounting for the intramolecular energies of the glycosidic linkages in the oligosaccharides during docking led VC to produce acceptable structures within the top five ranked poses in 74% of the systems tested, compared to a success rate of 55% for ADV. An enzyme system was employed in order to illustrate the potential application of VC to proteins that may distort glycosidic linkages of carbohydrate ligands upon binding. VC represents a significant step toward accurately predicting the structures of protein-carbohydrate complexes. Furthermore, the described approach is conceptually applicable to any class of ligands that populate well-defined conformational states.",

        "abstract": "nt of effective vaccines against emerging infectious diseases can take years to progress from pathogen isolation/identification to clinical approval. As a result, conventional approaches fail to produce field-ready vaccines before the EID has spread extensively. The VaxCelerate Project’s goal is to create a platform capable of generating and pre-clinically testing a new vaccine against specific pathogen targets in less than 120 days. A self-assembling vaccine, consisting of a fusion protein M. tuberculosis MTBhsp70 and avidin (MAV), is at the core of the approach. Mixing the MAV with biotinylated pathogen specific immunogenic peptides yields a self-assembled vaccine (SAV). To minimize the time required, we used a distributed R&D model involving experts in protein engineering, bioinformatics, peptide synthesis/design and GMP/GLP manufacturing and testing. This approach was first tested using ovalbumin in C57Bl/6 mice, Flu (H1N1) specific peptides, and ultimately a Lassa fever virus (LFV) specific vaccine in transgenic HLA DR3 mice. Using a GLP validated assay we demonstrated that the MAV assembled LFV induced significantly increased class II peptide specific interferon-CD4+ T cell responses in transgenic mice compared to peptide or MAV alone controls. The use of an identical design for each vaccine may facilitate accelerated regulatory review and by developing safety assessment tools that are more relevant to human vaccine responses than current preclinical models.",

A pathological feature is disinhibited brain frontal and temporal lobe function, with impaired attention, memory, judgment, emotional regulation and decision-making. Objective Conventional neuroimaging has limited ability to detect structural abnormalities in mTBI. Alternatively, a neuroimaging biomarker using MRI magneto-encephalograpy (MEG) is capable of mapping brain wave activity in mTBI. The objective was to use MEG technology to study brain function during a computerized “Go-No Go” vigilance and reaction test in military personnel. Design Prospective, case series clinical study. Setting Active duty infantrymen from the US Marine Corps explosive ordnance disposal program (high concussion risk). Participants 37 male subjects, tested (summer of 2013) during pre-deployment training at Camp Pendleton, CA. Assessment of risk factors The subjects completed neuroimaging, neurocognitive assessment and clinical interviews. Each provided data on mTBI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and had a MEG scan while performing the neurocognitive Go-NoGo test. Main outcome measurements 1) Motor cortex, frontal and temporal lobe activation, 2) commission errors (reacting when not supposed to), 3) PTSD and mTBI scoring. Results The Go stimulus activated the motor cortex exclusively, while the NoGo stimulus activated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left mediolateral temporal lobe (MLTL) exclusively. There were statistically significant negative correlations between: DLPFC and commission errors, and MLTL and Clinican-Administered PTSD scale. Conclusions MEG imaging showed regional brain activation patterns during functional tests requiring the individual to act, or to repress action. Lower activation of the frontal and temporal lobes was associated with more errors of inhibition, and greater fear symptoms. These structure-function relationships of the brain may be useful to predict concussion risk or monitor recovery. The subjects were deployed overseas (Fall 2013), and will be retested post-deployment (expected Spring 2015).",

During morning commutes over a period of three weeks, exposure to UFP was measured along three routes: two routes were alongside both sides of a busy arterial road with significantly higher levels of traffic on one side compared to the other, and the third route passed through quiet streets (the background route). The results indicate that the mean exposure for the pedestrian walking along the background route was half the exposure experienced on the other two routes. Walkers on the trafficked side were exposed to elevated concentrations (>100,000 pt/cc) 2.5 times longer than the low-trafficked side. However, the duration of the elevated exposure for the background route was close to zero.

        "abstract": "Microtubules are multistranded polymers in eukaryotic cells that support key cellular functions such as chromosome segregation, motor-based cargo transport, and maintenance of cell polarity. Microtubules self-assemble via \"dynamic instability,\" in which the dynamic plus ends switch stochastically between alternating phases of polymerization and depolymerization. A key question in the field is what are the atomistic origins of this switching, i.e., what is different between the GTP- and GDP-tubulin states that enables microtubule growth and shortening, respectively? More generally, a major challenge in biology is how to connect theoretical frameworks across length- and timescales, from atoms to cellular behavior. In this study, we describe a multiscale model by linking atomistic molecular dynamics (MD), molecular Brownian dynamics (BD), and cellular-level thermokinetic modeling of microtubules. Here, we investigated the underlying interaction energy when tubulin dimers associate laterally by performing all-atom MD simulations. We found that the lateral potential energy is not significantly different among three nucleotide states of tubulin, GTP, GDP, and GMPCPP and is estimated to be ≅ -11 kBT. Furthermore, using MD potential energy in our BD simulations of tubulin dimers confirms that the lateral bond is weak on its own, with a mean lifetime of ∼0.1 μs, implying that the longitudinal bond is required for microtubule assembly. We conclude that nucleotide-dependent lateral-bond strength is not the key mediator microtubule dynamic instability, implying that GTP acts elsewhere to exert its stabilizing influence on microtubule polymer. Furthermore, the estimated lateral-bond strength (ΔGlat0≅ -5 kBT) is well-aligned with earlier estimates based on thermokinetic modeling and light microscopy measurements. Thus, we have computationally connected atomistic-level structural information, obtained by cryo-electron microscopy, to cellular-scale microtubule assembly dynamics using a combination of MD, BD, and thermokinetic models to bridge from Ångstroms to micrometers and from femtoseconds to minutes.",

New to the restaurant industry, Sarah had found it very difficult to start working without any formal training and to be left standing in the corner without assistance on her first day. What should she share about her experience? Should she be honest about the problems she encountered? Would being honest hurt her chances for a good recommendation or future employment within the Sheraton chain? The Internship Experience The Four Points by Sheraton Hotel was part of the Starwood franchise system and was conveniently located minutes from the Kansas City International Airport. The hotel provided free 24-hour airport transportation, as well as transportation within a five mile radius. It had a three star rating with 200 guest rooms, a casual restaurant, bar, meeting rooms and was 100% smoke-free. Sarah was assigned as a dinner waitress in the Boulevard Grill, serving about 50 people per night. As an intern being evaluated for a grade, Sarah was apprehensive about her first hospitality position. \"I was extremely nervous going into this internship. I am a hotel and restaurant management major, but I have never worked in either venue. I read some narratives about waitressing and restaurants prior to my internship. These led me to believe that restaurants are scary, insane places with a dog-eat-dog mentality.\" As nervous as she was, she finished her spring semester on a Friday in early May, was moved into an apartment near the hotel by Sunday and started the for-credit internship on Tuesday. Tuesday morning was filled with human resources paperwork and Sheraton policy and procedure training. Tuesday afternoon included an introduction to the Boulevard Grill manager and a short education about the restaurant, the menu, and some specialty draft beers. Sarah was introduced to her supervisor, Grace, who spent the next hour showing Sarah around the restaurant and kitchen, pointing out the salad dressing cooler, hand washing sinks, drink station, bar pick-up area, dry storage, and the point-of-sales (POS) stations. Grace conveyed that there would be little one-on one training and that most training would be on the job. The only dinner waitress on staff was Lindsey, an 18 year old high school student with two years of food service experience. Grace instructed Sarah to follow Lindsey around for the rest of the evening. Sarah fetched salad dressing containers, carried out the desserts for tables, and learned how to roll silverware by watching Lindsey, who apparently didn't seem to care one way or another if Sarah was helping. The first customers arrived while the two were rolling silverware. Lindsey greeted them, showed them to their seats, and presented them with menus. Sarah was left rolling silverware and uncertain of what role she was supposed to play. Was she supposed to follow Lindsey and observe? Upon Lindsey's return she asked what she could do. Sarah was sent to get the beverages which Lindsey promptly delivered to the table. Sarah watched her take the order and input it into the POS system without providing any explanation about what she was doing. This process repeated itself until Sarah asked Lindsey if she should follow her out to the next table. Lindsey responded, \"Whatever,\" and walked off. Sarah watched Lindsey and learned how she approached the guests and presented the menus but was not close enough to hear. For example, the sandwiches and wraps came with one side item, so when a guest ordered a sandwich, wait-staff always had to ask if they would like French fries, coleslaw, cottage cheese, or fresh fruit. If a customer ordered a burger, wait-staff had to ask how they liked it cooked and what they would like for a side. Sarah was lost. She felt Lindsey wasn't trying to teach her anything. For the shift she was only permitted to fetch Lindsey's drink orders and cleaned up the tables once the guests had left. …",

The genus Oryza is composed of 23 species that are classified into ten distinct 'genome types' (six diploid and four polyploid), and is emerging as a powerful new model system to study polyploidy. Here we report the identification, sequence and comprehensive comparative annotation of eight homoeologous genomes from a single orthologous region (Adh1-Adh2) from four allopolyploid species representing each of the known Oryza genome types (BC, CD, HJ and KL). Detailed comparative phylogenomic analyses of these regions within and across species and ploidy levels provided several insights into the spatio-temporal dynamics of genome organization and evolution of this region in 'natural' polyploids of Oryza. The major findings of this study are that: (i) homoeologous genomic regions within the same nucleus experience both independent and parallel evolution, (ii) differential lineage-specific selection pressures do not occur between polyploids and their diploid progenitors, (iii) there have been no dramatic structural changes relative to the diploid ancestors, (iv) a variation in the molecular evolutionary rate exists between the two genomes in the BC complex species even though the BC and CD polyploid species appear to have arisen <2 million years ago, and (v) there are no clear distinctions in the patterns of genome evolution in the diploid versus polyploid species.",

It is a lifelong condition affecting on the patient's appearance, cognition, adaptive skills, physical growth, personality, body structure, and health. An infantile growth spurt and development of macrocephalia associated to hernias and respiratory infections are the key signs to an early identification of AGU. Progressive intellectual and physical disability is the main symptom leading to death usually before the age of 50 years.The disease is caused by the deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme glycosylasparaginase (aspartylglucosaminidase, AGA), which leads to a disorder in the degradation of glycoasparagines - aspartylglucosamine or other glycoconjugates with an aspartylglucosamine moiety at their reducing end - and accumulation of these undegraded glycoasparagines in tissues and body fluids. A single nucleotide change in the AGA gene resulting in a cysteine to serine substitution (C163S) in the AGA enzyme protein causes the deficiency of the glycosylasparaginase activity in the Finnish population. Homozygosity for the single nucleotide change causing the C163S mutation is responsible for 98% of the AGU cases in Finland simplifying the carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of the disorder in the Finnish population. A mouse strain, which completely lacks the Aga activity has been generated through targeted disruption of the Aga gene in embryonic stem cells. These Aga-deficient mice share most of the clinical, histopathologic and biochemical characteristics of human AGU disease. Treatment of AGU mice with recombinant AGA resulted in rapid correction of the pathophysiologic characteristics of AGU in non-neuronal tissues of the animals. The accumulation of aspartylglucosamine was reduced by up to 40% in the brain tissue of the animals depending on the age of the animals and the therapeutic protocol. Enzyme replacement trials on human AGU patients have not been reported so far. Allogenic stem cell transplantation has not proved effective in curing AGU.",

        "abstract": "Hemagglutinin (HA) is most abundant glycoprotein on the influenza virus surface. Influenza HA promotes viral entry by engaging the receptor and mediating virus-host membrane fusion. At the same time, HA is the major antigen of the influenza virus. HA antigenic shift can result in pandemics, whereas antigenic drift allows human circulating strains to escape herd immunity. Most antibody responses against HA are strain-specific. However, antibodies that have neutralizing activities against multiple strains or even subtypes have now been discovered and characterized. These broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) target conserved regions on HA, such as the receptor-binding site and the stem domain. Structural studies of such bnAbs have provided important insight into universal influenza vaccine and therapeutic design. This review discusses the HA functions as well as HA-antibody interactions from a structural perspective.",

Here, we describe a general approach to LHE engineering that combines rational design with directed evolution, using a yeast surface display high-throughput cleavage selection. This approach was employed to alter the binding and cleavage specificity of the I-Anil LHE to recognize a mutation in the mouse Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene causative for mouse X-linked immunodeficiency (XID)-a model of human X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). The required re-targeting of I-AniI involved progressive resculpting of the DNA contact interface to accommodate nine base differences from the native cleavage sequence. The enzyme emerging from the progressive engineering process was specific for the XID mutant allele versus the wild-type (WT) allele, and exhibited activity equivalent to WT I-AniI in vitro and in cellulo reporter assays. Fusion of the enzyme to a site-specific DNA binding domain of transcription activator-like effector (TALE) resulted in a further enhancement of gene editing efficiency. These results illustrate the potential of LHE enzymes as specific and efficient tools for therapeutic genome engineering.",

        "abstract": "land operations across force, formation, and unit node levels typically require information systems that support multiple security domains. Each domain requires its own servers, switching, cabling, and user terminals. This infrastructure limits mobility and places significant demands on transportation, set-up time, engineering support, and field power generation systems. Thales has successfully deployed the Cross Domain Solution (CDS), from Raytheon's Trusted Computer Solutions, aboard Royal Australian Navy (RAN) platforms and we are currently developing it for the strategic environment under the Chief Information Officer Group's (CIOG) Next Generation Desktop (NGD) program. The CDS enables user terminals to access multiple security domains across a single distribution network, improving user efficiency and significantly reducing the infrastructure footprint. This paper introduces CDS, explains how it works and provides supporting analysis of the logistical and other benefits from adopting a CDS - compared to existing deployed LAN architectures. It also describes how CDS can be used to provide efficient access for users within the constraints of vehicle mounted C4I solutions. The reduced footprint has many benefits. These include lower overall power consumption - which in turn equates to lower generator loads and fuel consumption, reduced time to deploy with fewer devices and less cable roll out and simplified introduction of new network services to deployed users as deployment scale changes. The key benefit for Defence is that a CDS will enable essential multi-domain information systems to be deployed in the land environment in a manageable, efficient, and effective way.",

Gluten is a common ingredient in daily diet and is one of the main environmental factors to induce coeliac disease. Adhering to gluten free diet (GFD) is an effective method for treating CD. Microbiota plays an extremely important role in maintaining human health, and diet is the main factor to regulate the composition and function of gut microbiota. Recent studies have shown that gluten metabolism is closely related to gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota. With the increasing prevalence of coeliac disease, there is a need for alternative treatments to GFD. In this review, biological medication of gluten, relationship between gluten and gut microflora, effect of GFD on GIT microflora, and effect of probiotics on CD were reviewed. By analysing the research progress on relationship between gluten and gastrointestinal microbiome in coeliac disease, this review tried to explore the prospective and potential mechanism of microecological agents in treating coeliac disease.",

These organophosphates have a thiol leaving group with a choline-like moiety and are hydrolyzed very slowly by natural enzymes. We used an integrated computational and experimental approach to increase Brevundimonas diminuta phosphotriesterase's (PTE) detoxification rate of V-agents by 5000-fold. Computational models were built of the complex between PTE and V-agents. On the basis of these models, the active site was redesigned to be complementary in shape to VX and RVX and to include favorable electrostatic interactions with their choline-like leaving group. Small libraries based on designed sequences were constructed. The libraries were screened by a direct assay for V-agent detoxification, as our initial studies showed that colorimetric surrogates fail to report the detoxification rates of the actual agents. The experimental results were fed back to improve the computational models. Overall, five rounds of iterating between experiment and model refinement led to variants that hydrolyze the toxic SP isomers of all three V-agents with kcat/KM values of up to 5 × 10(6) M(-1) min(-1) and also efficiently detoxify G-agents. These new catalysts provide the basis for broad spectrum nerve agent detoxification.",

Additionally, grant writing, like other research-associated activities, can improve student success in and out of the classroom. Grant writing can help students understand the alignment between research activities and a \"big picture\" understanding of the common good and societal impact of the research. Grant writing can improve students' ability to articulate the significance and broader impacts of research. Faculty mentors can play a major role in grant writing activities by helping to guide undergraduate students through the process. A course-based approach can help instructors who mentor students in research by providing scaffolding and scheduling tools. This article provides an overview of a grant writing course used as an efficient and effective way for undergraduate students to be guided through the grant proposal writing process with a greater potential for positive outcomes.

The reaction mechanism involves Michael addition of a nucleophile catalyst at the carbonyl β-carbon, followed by bond formation with the electrophile and catalyst disassociation to release the product. We used Rosetta to design 48 proteins containing active sites predicted to carry out this mechanism, of which two show catalytic activity by mass spectrometry (MS). Substrate labeling measured by MS and site-directed mutagenesis experiments show that the designed active-site residues are responsible for activity, although rate acceleration over background is modest. To characterize the designed proteins, we developed a fluorescence-based screen for intermediate formation in cell lysates, carried out microsecond molecular dynamics simulations, and solved X-ray crystal structures. These data indicate a partially formed active site and suggest several clear avenues for designing more active catalysts.",

        "abstract": "CONSPECTUS: Because living organisms are in constant motion, the word \"dynamics\" can hold many meanings to biologists. Here we focus specifically on the conformational changes that occur in proteins and how studying these protein dynamics may provide insights into enzymatic catalysis. Advances in integrating techniques such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron cryomicroscopy (cryo EM) allow us to model the dominant structures and exchange rates for many proteins and protein complexes. For proteins amenable to atomic resolution techniques, the major questions shift from simply describing the motions to discovering their role in function. Concurrently, there is an increasing need for using perturbations to test predictive models of dynamics-function relationships. Examples are the catalytic cycles of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and cyclophilin A (CypA). In DHFR, mutations that alter the ability of the active site to sample productive higher energy states on the millisecond time scale reduce the rate of hydride transfer significantly. Recently identified rescue mutations restore function, but the mechanism by which they do so remains unclear. The exact role of any changes in the dynamics remains an open question. For CypA, a network of side chains that exchange between two conformations is critical for catalysis. Mutations that lock the network in one state also reduce catalytic activity. A further understanding of enzyme dynamics of well-studied enzymes such as dihydrofolate reductase and cyclophilin A will lead to improvement in ability to modulate the functions of computationally designed enzymes and large macromolecular machines. In designed enzymes, directed evolution experiments increase catalytic rates. Detailed X-ray studies suggest that these mutations likely limit the conformational space explored by residues in the active site. For proteins where atomic resolution information is currently inaccessible, other techniques such as cryo-EM and high-resolution single molecule microscopy continue to advance. Understanding the conformational dynamics of larger systems such as protein machines will likely become more accessible and provide new opportunities to rationally modulate protein function.",

The great Egyptian famine of the years 1200-1202 enabled him to study and examine thousands of human cadavers and skeletons at first hand. This led to a new understanding of the anatomical structure of the human body, and rejected the more or less antiquated ideas of the Greek doctor Galen of Pergamum. However, 'Abd al-Latĭf's vision was granted only a short life. After his death, his discovery sank into oblivion and as a consequence it was never again mentioned in Arabic medical manuals. From then on the Arabic physicians once more referred to the anatomical data which were developed and taught by Galen. Relatively few specimens of his remaining medical work were preserved for posterity. However, his Book of the two advices (or: K. al-Nasĭhatain) is of the utmost importance as a source for the medical thinking and the medical treatment in the late twelfth and the early thirteenth century A.D.

The size and shape of many solid dosage forms impedes their in-situ analysis, particularly when using thermal analysis techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Thermal probe methods, which combine atomic force microscopy (AFM) with thermal analysis, permits imaging and characterisation of solid dosage forms in-situ. The goal of this thesis is to perform the in-situ analysis of film coated minitablets through the use of thermal probe methods. \nMinitablets, which are small diameter tablets, were coated with Opadry I, Opadry II or Surelease, and blends of Surelease and Opadry I and Surelease and Opadry II. In addition the same systems were prepared as cast free films to ascertain differences resulting from the two methods of producing the films. Distinct morphologies were observed between the film coated minitablets and cast free films, particularly for the polymer blends. Thermal analysis by modulated temperature DSC (MTDSC) and localised thermomechanical analysis (L-TMA) of film coated minitablets coated with polymer blends indicating miscibility. However the novel technique of heated tip tapping mode was employed, which was able to resolve separate domains of the polymer blends, which appeared as nanophases. Heated tip tapping mode was further employed to determine changes in the surface morphology of film coated minitablets which had undergone curing. It was successfully used to observe the further coalescence of Surelease and the alteration in the phase distribution of the polymer blends after film coated minitablets had been cured. Polymer films with incorporated pigments were also analysed by thermal probe methods with differences in pigment distribution being observed between film coated minitablets and cast free films. Tapping mode AFM was able to determine the location of pigment particles and the novel use of L-TMA performed in tapping mode allowed thermal analysis without changing AFM mode. Overall the use of AFM combined with thermal probes achieved the aim of performing in-situ analysis of polymer film coats; however further research to correlate in-vivo behaviour of film coats would be of value.",

The capsulo-ligamentous structures are the main stabilisers with the arm at the end-range of movement, whereas negative intra-articular pressure and concavity-compression effect are the main stabilisers with the arm in the mid-range of movement.There are two types of glenoid bone loss: fragment type and erosion type. A bone loss of the humeral head, known as a Hill-Sachs lesion (HSL), is a compression fracture of the humeral head caused by the anterior rim of the glenoid when the humeral head is dislocated anteriorly in front of the glenoid. Four out of five patients with anterior instability have both Hill-Sachs and glenoid bone lesions, which is called a 'bipolar lesion'.With the arm moving along the posterior end-range of movement, or with the arm in various degrees of abduction, maximum external rotation and maximum horizontal extension, the glenoid moves along the posterior articular margin of the humeral head. This contact zone of the glenoid with the humeral head is called the 'glenoid track'.A HSL, which stays on the glenoid track (on-track lesion), cannot engage with the glenoid and cannot cause dislocation. On the other hand, a HSL, which is out of the glenoid track (off-track lesion), has a risk of engagement and dislocation. Clinical validation studies show that the 'on-track/off-track' concept is able to predict reliably the risk of a HSL being engaged with the glenoid. For off-track lesions, either remplissage or Latarjet procedure is indicated, depending upon the glenoid defect size and the risk of recurrence. Cite this article: EFORT Open Rev 2017;2:343-351.",

In this Review, we describe the fundamentals of NGS, with a focus on 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We also discuss pros and cons of each methodology as well as important concepts in data variability, study design, and clinical metadata collection. We further present examples of how NGS studies of the human microbiome have advanced our understanding of human disease pathophysiology across diverse clinical contexts, including the development of diagnostics and therapeutics.

        "abstract": "The development of potent H2 production catalysts is a key aspect in our journey toward the establishment of a sustainable carbon-neutral power infrastructure. Hydrogenase enzymes provide the blueprint for designing efficient catalysts by the rational combination of central metal core and protein scaffold-based outer coordination sphere (OCS). Traditionally, a biomimetic catalyst is crafted by including natural amino acids as OCS features around a synthetic metal motif to functionally imitate the metalloenzyme activity. Here, we have pursued an unconventional approach and implanted two distinct drug molecules (isoniazid and nicotine hydrazide) at the axial position of a cobalt core to create a new genre of synthetic catalysts. The resultant cobalt complexes are active for both electrocatalytic and photocatalytic H2 production in near-neutral water, where they significantly enhance the catalytic performance of the unfunctionalized parent cobalt complex. The drug molecules showcased a dual effect as they influence the catalytic HER by improving the surrounding proton relay along and exerting subtle electronic effects. The isoniazid-ligated catalyst C1 outperformed the nicotine hydrazide-bound complex C2, as it produced H2 from water (pH 6.0) at a rate of 3960 s-1 while exhibiting Faradaic efficiency of about 90 %. This strategy opens up newer avenues of bio-inspired catalyst design beyond amino acid-based OCS features.",

        "abstract": "Penetrating thoracic trauma accounts for 20-25% of all deaths due to trauma in the first four decades of life. About 33% of deaths from thoracic trauma occur due to penetrating trauma. In an autopsy study that enrolled 1178 trauma patients, 82% of the patients with tracheobronchial injuries died at the incidence site. In another study, 30% of those who could be transferred to the hospital died. This review aimed to revisit penetrating thoracic trauma with respect to complications and the strategies for airway management. While the risk of death in injuries with a sharp object is normally 1-8%, it reaches 25-28% when the cardiac box is included, and still, most of the patients are lost before they can come to the hospital. The consequences and management of penetrating thoracic trauma are mainly dependent on the extent of the injury to internal organs, as well as on the skill of the clinicians, airway obstruction, respiratory failure, and bleeding. Chest computed tomography (CT) is better than chest radiography in diagnosing the main bronchus or lobe/segment rupture. However, with the use of multi-channel multi-detector CT, the sensitivity of CT imaging has increased to 94% in the diagnosis of tracheobronchial injuries. While standard orotracheal intubation is sufficient in 75% of the patients, flexible bronchoscopy, intubation through the open wound or tracheostomy is required for airway provision in the rest. Clinical suspicion is the first diagnostic tool in a patient with penetrating airway trauma, and early treatment with multidisciplinary teamwork is life-saving.",

We summarize the existing empirical evidence on this topic using meta-analysis and test for several mechanisms which can be responsible for the persistence of the wage gap. Based on 208 wage effects of having exactly one child and 245 wage effects of the total number of children, we find an average motherhood wage gap of around 3.6-3.8%. While the gaps associated with the total number of children are mostly explained by the loss of mothers' human capital during child-related career breaks, the gaps associated with one child are predominantly driven by mothers' choice of jobs and occupations that pay less. The residual gap is smallest in Nordic countries, where public policies actively support gender equality and reconciliation of work and family, as well as Belgium and France, and largest in the post-socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe and Anglo-Saxon countries.",

However, relatively little is known about the underlying psychological factors and mechanisms. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of a winter vacation on individuals' wellbeing. A total of 507 participants (255 men and 252 women) completed three questionnaires at three different time points. The questionnaires comprised psychological scales and items to seek demographic information so that the changes in their wellbeing could be assessed. The results revealed that people who traveled had higher subjective wellbeing than those who did not. Moreover, out of the four elements of the recovery experience, mastery was the only one influenced subsequent subjective wellbeing. The findings suggest that it is crucial to take vacations and to savor recovery experiences while off work. In particular, experiencing new and challenging events during a vacation was the most significant predictor of vacationers' subsequent wellbeing. Our results clarify what type of vacation is most effective for wellbeing. The results can help tourism practitioners manage their customers' experiences better during their vacations, and these efforts will arguably contribute not only to the wellbeing of vacationers but also to future company growth.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, graphene-based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have come into prominence showcasing interesting charge transfer dynamics which is significant for optoelectronic applications. These novel structures are highly tunable depending on several factors such as the combination of the two-dimensional materials, the number of layers and band alignment exhibiting interfacial charge transfer dynamics. Here, we report on a novel graphene based 0D-2D vdW heterostructure between graphene and amine-functionalized graphene quantum dots (GQD) to investigate the interfacial charge transfer and doping possibilities. Using a combination ofab initiosimulations and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements, we confirm that the incorporation of functional GQDs leads to a charge transfer induced p-type doping in graphene. A shift of the Dirac point by 0.05 eV with respect to the Fermi level (EF) in the graphene from the heterostructure was deduced from the calculated density of states. KPFM measurements revealed an increment in the surface potential of the GQD in the 0D-2D heterostructure by 29 mV with respect to graphene. Furthermore, we conducted power dependent Raman spectroscopy for both graphene and the heterostructure samples. An optical doping-induced gating effect resulted in a stiffening of theGband for electrons and holes in both samples (graphene and the heterostructure), suggesting a breakdown of the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Moreover, charge imbalance and renormalization of the electron-hole dispersion under the additional influence of the doped functional GQDs is pointing to an asymmetry in conduction and carrier mobility.",

The combination of Rosetta rebuilding and phenix rebuilding is the key part of this method. MR solutions are found with phenix. automr (Phaser), scored with LLG (optionally following Rosetta relaxation), the best solutions are picked and rebuilt with Rosetta including map information, the resulting models are scored with Rosetta, and then rescored with LLG, and the top models are rebuilt with phenix. autobuild. It can be very useful for cases where the search model used in molecular replacement is slightly too distant to rebuild successfully with phenix. autobuild. It can also be useful in cases where the model is too distant to even find a molecular replacement solution, and prerefinement with Rosetta can yield an improved search model.",

The 2019 report presents an annual update of 41 indicators across five key domains: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability; adaptation, planning, and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. The report represents the findings and consensus of 35 leading academic institutions and UN agencies from every continent. Each year, the methods and data that underpin the Lancet Countdown’s indicators are further developed and improved, with updates described at each stage of this report. The collaboration draws on the world-class expertise of climate scientists; ecologists; mathematicians; engineers; energy, food, and transport experts; economists; social and political scientists; public health professionals; and doctors, to generate the quality and diversity of data required. The science of climate change describes a range of possible futures, which are largely dependent on the degree of action or inaction in the face of a warming world. The policies implemented will have far-reaching effects in determining these eventualities, with the indicators tracked here monitoring both the present-day effects of climate change, as well as the worldwide response. Understanding these decisions as a choice between one of two pathways—one that continues with the business as usual response and one that redirects to a future that remains “well below 2°C”—helps to bring the importance of recognising the effects of climate change and the necessary response to the forefront. Evidence provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the International Energy Agency, and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration clarifies the degree and magnitude of climate change experienced today and contextualises these two pathways.",

In the studies showing positive results, different definitions of affection and a wide spectrum of diagnoses were used. Our objectives were not only to test for linkage at 6p24-22 in the Eastern Quebec population, but also to test whether this putative vulnerability locus was either selectively linked to schizophrenia (SZ), or to bipolar disorder (BP), or to both major psychoses. Parametric and nonparametric linkage analyses with 12 microsatellite markers in 6p24-p22 were performed on a sample of 18 large multigenerational pedigrees (N = 354) either affected by SZ, or by BP, or equally affected by both major psychoses (i.e., mixed pedigrees). Three affection definitions were usually tested in our program: one on schizophrenia (SZ), one on bipolar disorder (BP), and one that comprised SZ and BP under the hypothesis of a susceptibility locus common to both in major psychoses (common locus, CL). The results of parametric analyses did not support a major gene hypothesis. However, in one large mixed pedigree (#151), we observed with the common locus phenotype (CL) lod scores of 2.49 and 2.15, respectively, at the D6S296 and D6S277 loci under a dominant model. Our data suggest the presence of a potential vulnerability locus at 6p24-22 that could be related to both schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder. These results may be seen as congruent with former studies that used schizoaffective as well as schizophrenia diagnoses as entry criteria for the affected families, and used an affection definition that comprised affective psychoses as well as schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "These guidelines describe a comprehensive strategy to optimize oxygenation, airway management, and tracheal intubation in critically ill patients, in all hospital locations. They are a direct response to the 4th National Audit Project of the Royal College of Anaesthetists and Difficult Airway Society, which highlighted deficient management of these extremely vulnerable patients leading to major complications and avoidable deaths. They are founded on robust evidence where available, supplemented by expert consensus opinion where it is not. These guidelines recognize that improved outcomes of emergency airway management require closer attention to human factors, rather than simply introduction of new devices or improved technical proficiency. They stress the role of the airway team, a shared mental model, planning, and communication throughout airway management. The primacy of oxygenation including pre- and peroxygenation is emphasized. A modified rapid sequence approach is recommended. Optimal management is presented in an algorithm that combines Plans B and C, incorporating elements of the Vortex approach. To avoid delays and task fixation, the importance of limiting procedural attempts, promptly recognizing failure, and transitioning to the next algorithm step are emphasized. The guidelines recommend early use of a videolaryngoscope, with a screen visible to all, and second generation supraglottic airways for airway rescue. Recommendations for emergency front of neck airway are for a scalpel-bougie-tube technique while acknowledging the value of other techniques performed by trained experts. As most critical care airway catastrophes occur after intubation, from dislodged or blocked tubes, essential methods to avoid these complications are also emphasized.",

        "abstract": "An array of carbohydrates masks the HIV-1 surface protein Env, contributing to the evasion of humoral immunity. In most HIV-1 isolates 'glycan holes' occur due to natural sequence variation, potentially revealing the underlying protein surface to the immune system. Here we computationally design epitopes that mimic such surface features (carbohydrate-occluded neutralization epitopes or CONE) of Env through 'epitope transplantation', in which the target region is presented on a carrier protein scaffold with preserved structural properties. Scaffolds displaying the four CONEs are examined for structure and immunogenicity. Crystal structures of two designed proteins reflect the computational models and accurately mimic the native conformations of CONEs. The sera from rabbits immunized with several CONE immunogens display Env binding activity. Our method determines essential structural elements for targets of protective antibodies. The ability to design immunogens with high mimicry to viral proteins also makes possible the exploration of new templates for vaccine development.",

For the first time, aggressive sampling and all-atom refinement could be carried out for the majority of targets, an advance enabled by the Rosetta@home distributed computing network. Template-based modeling predictions using an iterative refinement algorithm improved over the best existing templates for the majority of proteins with less than 200 residues. Free modeling methods gave near-atomic accuracy predictions for several targets under 100 residues from all secondary structure classes. These results indicate that refinement with an all-atom energy function, although computationally expensive, is a powerful method for obtaining accurate structure predictions.",

The analysis unpacks the central role of whiteness and Western ethnicity under the 'Chinese gaze', intersected by nationality. However, while they are marked by continuities of white privilege, the resulting racialised positionalities of the foreign white 'others' are characterised by a simultaneous elevation and subjugation, equally shaped by a 'Chinese ascendancy'. European migrants' self-positionings meander between this ambiguous 'outsiderness' and a propensity for integration as they navigate the multifaceted middle positions they occupy. Contextualising the findings in research on white migration movements from the West, the conclusion suggests that the class-based notion of middling migration should be refined by including economic, social and cultural ways of being 'of the middle'.",

Most of us use social media sites to exchange or obtain information. This opens a lot of space for false information, like fake news, rumors, etc., to spread that could harm a society's social fabric, a person's reputation, or the legitimacy of a whole country. Therefore, preventing the transmission of such dangerous material across platforms is a digital priority. However, the main goal of this survey paper is to thoroughly examine several current state-of-the-art research works on rumor control (detection and prevention) that use deep learning-based techniques and to identify major distinctions between these research efforts. The comparison results are intended to identify research gaps and challenges for rumor detection, tracking, and combating. This survey of the literature makes a significant contribution by highlighting several cutting-edge deep learning-based models for rumor detection in social media and critically evaluating their effectiveness on recently available standard datasets. Furthermore, to have a thorough grasp of rumor prevention to spread, we also looked into various pertinent approaches, including rumor veracity classification, stance classification, tracking, and combating. We also have created a summary of recent datasets with all the necessary information and analysis. Finally, as part of this survey, we have identified some of the potential research gaps and challenges that need to be addressed in order to develop early, effective methods of rumor control.",

        "abstract": "of Polar UVI auroral image data reviewed in our other presentation at this meeting (V. Uritsky, A. Klimas) show that bright night-side high-latitude UV emissions exhibit so many of the key properties of systems in self-organized criticality (SOC) that an alternate interpretation has become virtually impossible. It is now necessary to find and model the source of this behavior. We note that the most common models of self-organized criticality are numerical sandpiles. These are, at root, models that govern the transport of some quantity from a region where it is loaded to another where it is unloaded. Transport is enabled by the excitation of a local threshold instability; it is intermittent and bursty, and it exhibits a number of scale-free statistical properties. Searching for a system in the magnetosphere that is analogous and that, in addition, is known to produce auroral signatures, we focus on the reconnection dynamics of the plasma sheet. In our previous work, a driven reconnection model has been constructed and has been under study. The transport of electromagnetic (primarily magnetic) energy carried by the Poynting flux into the reconnection region of the model has been examined. All of the analysis techniques, and more, that have been applied to the auroral image data have also been applied to this Poynting flux. Here, we report new results showing that this model also exhibits so many of the key properties of systems in self-organized criticality that an alternate interpretation is implausible. Further, we find a strong correlation between these key properties of the model and those of the auroral UV emissions. We suggest that, in general, the driven reconnection model is an important step toward a realistic plasma physical model of self-organized criticality and we conclude, more specifically, that it is also a step in the right direction toward modeling the multiscale reconnection dynamics of the magnetotail.",

From a current perspective, two such instances are worth mentioning and describing: Glaucus of Potniae, King of Efyra, and Diomedes, King of Thrace, who were both devoured by their horses. In both cases, the horses' extreme aggression and their subsequent anthropophagic behaviour were attributed to their madness (hippomania) induced by the custom of feeding them with flesh. The current problem of 'mad cow' disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) is apparently related to a similar feed pattern. Aggressive behaviour in horses can be triggered by both biological and psychological factors. In the cases cited here, it is rather unlikely that the former were the cause. On the other hand, the multiple abuses imposed on the horses, coupled with people's fantasies and largely unconscious fears (hippophobia), may possibly explain these mythological descriptions of 'horse-monsters'.",

This review describes how sequential SO-spindle-ripple coupling provides a temporally and spatially fine-tuned mechanism to selectively strengthen target memories across hippocampal and cortical networks. Coupled sleep rhythms might be harnessed not only to enhance overnight memory retention, but also to combat memory decline associated with healthy ageing and neurodegenerative diseases.",

In contrast, in active lesions, mGluR8 immunoreactivity (IR) was detected in cells of the microglia/macrophage lineage. Fewer macrophage-like cells were positive for mGluR8 in chronic active and inactive lesions. No mGluR4 IR was detected in cells of the microglia/macrophage lineage in the MS lesions studied. In chronic active lesions, however, a population of reactive astrocytes localized in the rim of the lesions expressed both mGluR4 and mGluR8.

        "abstract": "Several naturally occurring polypeptide neurotoxins target specific sites on the voltage-gated sodium channels. Of these, the gating modifier toxins alter the behavior of the sodium channels by stabilizing transient intermediate states in the channel gating pathway. Here we have used an integrated approach that combines electrophysiological and spectroscopic measurements to determine the structural rearrangements modified by the beta-scorpion toxin Ts1. Our data indicate that toxin binding to the channel is restricted to a single binding site on domain II voltage sensor. Analysis of Cole-Moore shifts suggests that the number of closed states in the activation sequence prior to channel opening is reduced in the presence of toxin. Measurements of charge-voltage relationships show that a fraction of the gating charge is immobilized in Ts1-modified channels. Interestingly, the charge-voltage relationship also shows an additional component at hyperpolarized potentials. Site-specific fluorescence measurements indicate that in presence of the toxin the voltage sensor of domain II remains trapped in the activated state. Furthermore, the binding of the toxin potentiates the activation of the other three voltage sensors of the sodium channel to more hyperpolarized potentials. These findings reveal how the binding of beta-scorpion toxin modifies channel function and provides insight into early gating transitions of sodium channels.",

        "title": "Role of glial cystine-glutamate transporters in addiction",
        "abstract": "Modafinil may be useful for treating stimulant abuse, but the mechanisms by which it acts to do so are unknown. Indeed, a primary effect of modafinil is to inhibit dopamine transport, which typically promotes rather than inhibits motivated behavior. Therefore, we examined the role of nucleus accumbens extracellular glutamate and the group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2/3) in modafinil effects. One group of rats was trained to self-administer cocaine for 10 days and extinguished, then given priming injections of cocaine to elicit reinstatement. Modafinil (300 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) inhibited reinstated cocaine seeking (but did not alter extinction responding by itself), and this effect was prevented by pre-treatment with bilateral microinjections of the mGluR2/3 antagonist LY-341495 (LY) into nucleus accumbens core. No reversal of modafinil effects was seen after unilateral accumbens core LY, or bilateral LY in the rostral pole of accumbens. Next, we sought to explore effects of modafinil on extracellular glutamate levels in accumbens after chronic cocaine. Separate rats were administered non-contingent cocaine, and after 3 weeks of withdrawal underwent accumbens microdialysis. Modafinil increased extracellular accumbens glutamate in chronic cocaine, but not chronic saline-pre-treated animals. This increase was prevented by reverse dialysis of cystine-glutamate exchange or voltage-dependent calcium channel antagonists. Voltage-dependent sodium channel blockade partly attenuated the increase in glutamate, but mGluR1 blockade did not. We conclude that modafinil increases extracellular glutamate in nucleus accumbens from glial and neuronal sources in cocaine-exposed rats, which may be important for its mGluR2/3-mediated antirelapse properties.",

        "abstract": "On initial inspection, bone remodeling, the process whereby the skeleton adapts through time, appears to be relatively simple. Two cell types, the bone-forming osteoblasts and the bone-resorbing osteoclasts, interact to keep bone mass relatively stable throughout adult life. However, the complexity of the regulatory influences on these cells is continuing to expand our understanding of the intricacy of skeletal physiology and also the interactions between other organ systems and bone. One such example of the broadening of understanding in this field has occurred in the last decade with study of the central, neural regulation of bone mass. Initial studies of an adipose-derived hormone, leptin, helped define a direct, sympathetic pathway involving efferent neural signals from the hypothalamus to receptors on the osteoblast. Since the leptin-mediated pathway has been continuously modified to reveal a complex system involving neuromedin U, cocaine- and amphetamine-related transcript and serotonin interacting within the hypothalamus and brainstem to regulate both bone formation and resorption in cancellous bone, a number of other systems have also been identified. Neuropeptide Y, acting through hypothalamic Y2 receptors, is capable of skeleton-wide modulation of osteoblast activity, with important coordination between body weight and bone mass. Cannabinoids, acting through central cannabinoid receptor 1 and bone cell cannabinoid receptor 2 receptors, modulate osteoclast activity, thereby identifying pathways active on both aspects of the bone remodeling process. This review explores the key central pathways to bone and explores the complexity of the interactions being revealed by this emergent field of research.",

Risk factors related to PTSD include pre-event, event- and post-event ones. Some of the genes related to PTSD include: FKBP5, 5-HTTLPR, and COMT (which are, respectively, FK506-binding protein 5 gene, serotonin-transporter linked polymorphic region, catechol-O-methyl-transferase). These genetic findings give an estimate of 30% for the genetic influence on PTSD. The typical brain regions involved in PTSD include the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex, along with the insula. Causal models of behavior are multifactorial and biopsychosocial, and these types of models apply to PTSD, as well. The paper presents a multilevel systems model of psychopathology, including PTSD, which involves three levels - a top-down psychological construct one, a bottom-up symptom connection one, and a middle one involving symptom appraisal. Legally, causality refers to the event at issue needing to meet the bar of being materially contributory to the outcome. Finally, this section of the article reviews empirically-supported therapies for PTSD and the dangers of not receiving treatment for it.",

        "abstract": "Protein complexes play vital roles in a variety of biological processes, such as mediating biochemical reactions, the immune response and cell signalling, with 3D structure specifying function. Computational docking methods provide a means to determine the interface between two complexed polypeptide chains without using time-consuming experimental techniques. The docking process requires the optimal solution to be selected with a scoring function. Here, we propose a novel graph-based deep learning model that utilizes mathematical graph representations of proteins to learn a scoring function (GDockScore). GDockScore was pre-trained on docking outputs generated with the Protein Data Bank biounits and the RosettaDock protocol, and then fine-tuned on HADDOCK decoys generated on the ZDOCK Protein Docking Benchmark. GDockScore performs similarly to the Rosetta scoring function on docking decoys generated using the RosettaDock protocol. Furthermore, state-of-the-art is achieved on the CAPRI score set, a challenging dataset for developing docking scoring functions.",

Consequently, wing plasticity (where individuals can be winged or wingless depending on environmental conditions) is an important factor in the spread of aphid-associated viruses. We review several fascinating systems where aphid-vectored plant viruses interact with aphid wing plasticity, both indirectly by manipulating plant physiology and directly through molecular interactions with plasticity pathways. We also cover recent examples where aphid-specific viruses and endogenous viral elements within aphid genomes influence wing formation. We discuss why unrelated viruses with different transmission modes have convergently evolved to manipulate wing formation in aphids and whether this is advantageous for both host and virus. We argue that interactions with viruses are likely shaping the evolution of wing plasticity within and across aphid species, and we discuss the potential importance of these findings for aphid biocontrol.",

A brief outline of the computational modeling, in the framework of continuum electrostatics, is presented and the basic electrostatic effects occurring upon the formation of the complex are discussed. The effect of the salt concentration and pH of the water phase on protein-protein binding free energy is demonstrated which indicates that the increase of the salt concentration tends to weaken the binding, an observation that is attributed to the optimization of the charge-charge interactions across the interface. It is pointed out that the pH-optimum (pH of optimal binding affinity) varies among the protein-protein complexes, and perhaps is a result of their adaptation to particular subcellular compartments. The similarities and differences between hetero- and homo-complexes are outlined and discussed with respect to the binding mode and charge complementarity.",

        "abstract": "A variety of data point to the possibility that neuroadaptations in glutamate transmission are produced by repeated exposure to cocaine that result in the expression of behaviors characteristic of addiction, such as craving and relapse. Using the reinstatement model of relapse in rats, glutamate release in the projection from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens has been shown to underlie cocaine- and stress-primed reinstatement. In this report, four adaptations produced by withdrawal from repeated cocaine are described that may regulate the release of glutamate underlying reinstatement of drug-seeking resulted. (1) Neurons in the prefrontal cortex have increased levels of activator of G protein signaling 3 (AGS3) that causes reduced signaling through Gi coupled receptors, and normalization of AGS3 blocked cocaine-primed reinstatement. (2) The activity of the cystine-glutamate exchanger is reduced resulting in decreased extracellular glutamate in the nucleus accumbens, and normalization of exchanger activity prevented cocaine-primed reinstatement. (3) Metobotropic glutamate receptor function is diminished after repeated cocaine administration that results in reduced regulation of glutamate release. (4) Homer1 protein is reduced in the nucleus accumbens, and Homer2 knockout mice show enhanced responsiveness to cocaine. Taken together, there appears to be both pre- and postsynaptic changes in glutamate transmission that dysregulates the glutamatergic projection from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens. These adaptations are hypothesized to facilitate glutamate release in response to a cocaine injection or acute stress and lead to the reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior.",

GNAS encodes the alpha-subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gsα) and several splice variants thereof. PHP type Ia (PHP1A) is caused by heterozygous inactivating mutations involving the maternal exons 1-13. Heterozygosity of these maternal GNAS mutations cause PTH-resistant hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia because paternal Gsα expression is suppressed in certain organs thus leading to little or no Gsα protein in the proximal renal tubules and other tissues. Besides biochemical abnormalities, PHP1A patients show developmental abnormalities, referred to as Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO). Some, but not all of these AHO features are encountered also in patients affected by PPHP, who carry paternal Gsα-specific mutations and typically show no laboratory abnormalities. Autosomal dominant PHP type Ib (AD-PHP1B) is caused by heterozygous maternal deletions within GNAS or STX16, which are associated with loss of methylation at the A/B DMR alone or at all maternally methylated GNAS exons. Loss of methylation of exon A/B and the resulting biallelic expression of A/B transcript reduces Gsα expression thus leading to hormonal resistance. Epigenetic changes at all differentially methylated GNAS regions are also observed in sporadic PHP1B, which is the most frequent PHP1B variant. However, this disease variant remains unresolved at the molecular level, except for rare cases with paternal uniparental isodisomy or heterodisomy of chromosome 20q (patUPD20q).",

We examined the conformational landscape of the PFP⋅⋅⋅water complex using chirped pulsed Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Rotational spectra of two PFP⋅⋅⋅water conformers, PFPG+g+⋅⋅⋅WH and PFPTg+⋅⋅⋅WH , and seven deuterated isotopologues of each, were assigned. Tunneling splittings were observed for both conformers and are attributed to the exchange of the bonded and non-bonded hydrogen atoms of water. On the other hand, the tunneling splitting associated with the OH flipping motion in PFPTg+/Tg- appears to be quenched upon hydrogen bonding with water. The large amplitude motions associated with the water subunits were examined in detail to explain the very different magnitudes of the experimental and theoretical permanent electric dipole moment components. The study highlights the challenge in correctly identifying the conformers observed when large amplitude motions are involved. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and non-covalent interaction (NCI) analyses, as well as electrostatic potential (ESP) calculations were carried out to explore the nature of the non-covalent interactions and to appreciate the effects of fluorination.",

        "abstract": "Scaling properties of a two-dimensional (2d) plasma physical current-sheet simulation model involving a full set of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations with current-dependent resistivity are investigated. The current sheet supports a spatial magnetic field reversal that is forced through loading of magnetic flux containing plasma at boundaries of the simulation domain. A balance is reached between loading and annihilation of the magnetic flux through reconnection at the current sheet; the transport of magnetic flux from boundaries to current sheet is realized in the form of spatiotemporal avalanches exhibiting power-law statistics of lifetimes and sizes. We identify this dynamics as self-organized criticality (SOC) by verifying an extended set of scaling laws related to both global and local properties of the current sheet (critical susceptibility, finite-size scaling of probability distributions, geometric exponents). The critical exponents obtained from this analysis suggest that the model operates in a slowly driven SOC state similar to the mean-field state of the directed stochastic sandpile model. We also investigate multiscale correlations in the velocity field and find them numerically indistinguishable from certain intermittent turbulence (IT) theories. The results provide clues on physical conditions for SOC behavior in a broad class of plasma systems with propagating instabilities, and suggest that SOC and IT may coexist in driven current sheets which occur ubiquitously in astrophysical and space plasmas.",

Using small organic molecules to disrupt protein-protein interactions is a current challenge in chemical biology. An important example of protein-protein interactions is provided by the Myc protein, which is frequently deregulated in human cancers. Myc belongs to the family of basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-ZIP) transcription factors. It is biologically active only as heterodimer with the bHLH-ZIP protein Max. Herein, we report a new strategy for the disruption of protein-protein interactions that has been corroborated through the design and synthesis of a small parallel library composed of 'credit-card' compounds. These compounds are derived from a planar, aromatic scaffold and functionalized with four points of diversity. From a 285 membered library, several hits were obtained that disrupted the c-Myc-Max interaction and cellular functions of c-Myc. The IC50 values determined for this small focused library for the disruption of Myc-Max dimerization are quite potent, especially since small molecule antagonists of protein-protein interactions are notoriously difficult to find. Furthermore, several of the compounds were active at the cellular level as shown by their biological effects on Myc action in chicken embryo fibroblast assays. In light of our findings, this approach is considered a valuable addition to the armamentarium of new molecules being developed to interact with protein-protein interfaces. Finally, this strategy for disrupting protein-protein interactions should prove applicable to other families of proteins.",

On August 10, most of the rainfall fell over sloped areas. The heaviest daily rainfall totals were in excess of 200 mm over southwestern as well as central Taiwan. However, not much rainfall occurred over northern Taiwan. The lack of rainfall over northern Taiwan also occurred on August 11, 12 and 13. The larger rainfall amounts shifted westward from the sloped areas on August 10 toward lower terrain on August 11. On August 12 and 13, most of the higher rainfall amounts were found over the coastal area in southwestern Taiwan. Notably, about 300 to 400 mm per day fell over the coastal area in southwest Taiwan on August 12 and 13. The distribution of rainfall amount was different on August 10 and 11 (termed as Case 1) compared to August 12 and 13 (termed as Case 2). The environmental situation and precipitation characteristics are analyzed using EC/TOGA data, ground-based radar data, surface rainfall patterns, surface wind data, and upper air soundings. Chen at al. (2001) also categorized the precipitation pattern into two types, propagating and quasi-stationary. For the propagating type of precipitation, rainrates increased or remained the same as systems went from the plains to mountainous regions. With the quasi-stationary type of precipitation, however, rainrates decreased as precipitation propagated across the plains and into the mountains. The focus of this study is to understand what causes the h1aher amounts of rainfall over Taiwan, and what factors influence where the higher amounts of rainfall will occur, over sloped areas or over coastal areas.",

Most patients on efavirenz-containing regimens have sustained antiviral responses; however, rebounds in plasma viral load have been observed in some patients in association with the emergence of mutant strains of HIV-1. Virus isolates from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with such treatment failures, as well as recombinant viruses incorporating viral sequences derived from patient plasma, show reduced in vitro susceptibility to efavirenz in association with mutations in the RT gene encoding K103N, Y188L, or G190S/E substitutions. Patterns of RT gene mutations and in vitro susceptibility were similar in plasma virus and in viruses isolated from PBMCs. Variant strains of HIV-1 constructed by site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the role of K103N, G190S, and Y188L substitutions in reduced susceptibility to efavirenz. Further, certain secondary mutations (V106I, V108I, Y181C, Y188H, P225H, and F227L) conferred little resistance to efavirenz as single mutations but enhanced the level of resistance of viruses carrying these mutations in combination with K103N or Y188L. Viruses with K103N or Y188L mutations, regardless of the initial selecting nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), exhibited cross-resistance to all of the presently available NNRTIs (efavirenz, nevirapine, and delavirdine). Some virus isolates from nevirapine or delavirdine treatment failures that lacked K103N or Y188L mutations remained susceptible to efavirenz in vitro, although the clinical significance of this finding is presently unclear.",

In summertime, CO2 concentration is driven by photosynthetic activity of autotrophs which raises seawater pH and carbonate saturation state (Ω). In addition, restriction of photosynthetic activity to the euphotic zone and establishment of seasonal stratification often leads to depth gradients in pH and Ω. In winter, however, severely reduced primary production along with respiration processes lead to higher CO2 concentrations which consequently decrease seawater pH and Ω. Many calcifying invertebrates incorporate other metals, in addition to calcium, into their skeletons, with potential consequences for stability of the mineral matrix and vulnerability to abrasion of predators. We tested whether changes in seawater chemistry due to light-driven activities of marine biota can influence the uptake of Mg into calcified skeletons of Arctic Bryozoa, a dominant faunal group in polar hard-bottom habitats. Our results indicate no clear differences between summer and winter levels of skeletal MgCO3 in five bryozoan species despite differences in Ω between these two seasons. Furthermore, we could not detect any depth-related differences in MgCO3 content in skeletons of selected bryozoans. These results may indicate that Arctic bryozoans are able to control MgCO3 skeletal concentrations biologically. Yet recorded spatial variability in MgCO3 content in skeletons from stations exhibiting different seawater parameters suggests that environmental factors can also, to some extent, shape the skeletal chemistry of Arctic bryozoans.",

Unusually, the proteins appear to be bifunctional; their amino-terminal regions have strong similarity with P-type ATPases, and the sequence and structure of the carboxyl-terminal regions conform to that of G protein-dependent adenylyl cyclases, with two sets of six transmembrane sequences, each followed by a catalytic domain (C1 and C2). However, amino acids that are enzymatically important and present in the C2 domain of mammalian adenylyl cyclases are located in the C1 domain of the P. falciparum proteins and vice versa. In addition, certain key residues in these domains are more characteristic of guanylyl cyclases. Consistent with this, guanylyl cyclase activity was obtained following expression of the catalytic domains of PfGCβ inEscherichia coli.

The activity of these enzymes is crucial for maintaining cell homeostasis, yet these enzymes have been often dismissed as humble house-keeping proteins. Understandably, mutations and changes in expression patterns of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases are implicated in tumorigenesis and various carcinomas. The conserved nature of their catalytic domains makes drug discovery a challenging pursuit. In this review, we focus on describing the various classes of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases and their catalytic domains. We also summarize their role in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases using specific members as the model system. Finally, we explain the dichotomy in the biological role of catalytically active vs the pseudoenzyme forms of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases in the context of their membrane bound receptor forms. This chapter aims to provide a current understanding of these proteins, in the background of their foundational past research.",

A random sample of health professionals (n= 47) from various disciplines at eight health service sites participated in semi-structured interviews regarding the types of information they provided to CRC patients. Information items were mapped against a published CRC patient management framework and evaluated. A total of 193 information items were collected with 24 items specific to CRC. Gaps in information provision were evident in the community, at diagnosis, in clinics, when treatment was determined and when completed. The quality of information delivery to CRC patients across the public health sites was variable. Resources were often unavailable, out of date and inaccessible in other languages. Results indicate a need to improve health information availability and resource delivery to all CRC patients across different health services particularly at diagnosis and after treatment. Further research is required to determine patient preferences for information about CRC.",

        "abstract": "The stable isotopes 2H and 18O were used to determine the water sources of Eucalyptus camaldulensis at three sites with varying exposure to stream water, all underlain by moderately saline groundwater. Water uptake patterns were a function of the long-term availability of surface water. Trees with permanent access to a stream used some stream water at all times. However, water from soils or the water table commonly made up 50% of these trees' water. Trees beside an ephemeral stream had access to the stream 40-50% of the time (depending on the level of the stream). No more than 30% of the water they used was stream water when it was available. However, stream water use did not vary greatly whether the trees had access to the stream for 2 weeks or 10 months prior to sampling. Trees at the third site only had access to surface water during a flood. These trees did not change their uptake patterns during 2 months inundation compared with dry times, so were not utilising the low-salinity flood water. Pre-dawn leaf water potentials and leaf 13C measurements showed that the trees with permanent access to the stream experienced lower water stress and had lower water use efficiencies than trees at the least frequently flooded site. The trees beside the ephemeral stream appeared to change their water use efficiency in response to the availability of surface water; it was similar to the perennial-stream trees when stream water was available and higher at other times. Despite causing water stress, uptake of soil water and groundwater would be advantageous to E. camaldulensis in this semi-arid area, as it would provide the trees with a supply of nutrients and a reliable source of water. E. camaldulensis at the study site may not be as vulnerable to changes in stream flow and water quality as previously thought.",

We conducted a systematic review of published literature to compare the toxicants produced in each of these phases of tobacco combustion (MS, SS, and CBs). The initial search included 12,301 articles, but after screening and final restrictions considering the aims of this review, 159 published studies were selected for inclusion. Additionally, SHS and THS are briefly discussed here. Overall, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other aromatic hydrocarbons have been represented in more studies than other compounds. However, metals and nitrosamines were detected in higher concentrations than other components in SS. The concentrations of most PAHs and other aromatic hydrocarbons in MS and SS are higher compared to concentrations found in CBs. Also, the concentrations of all the studied carbonyl compounds, aldehydes and ketones in SS and MS were higher than in CBs. The mean levels of alcohols and phenols in SS were higher than those reported for both MS and CBs. Tobacco toxicants are inhaled by smokers and transmitted to the environment through SS, SHS, THS, and discarded CBs. However, further studies are necessary to assess adverse effects of toxicants found in CBs and THS not only on human health, but also on the environment and ecosystems. The results of this review provide updated information on the chemical contents of MS, SS, SHS, THS, and CBs. It adds to the growing understanding that smoking creates major health problems for smokers and passive smokers, but also that it generates environmental hazards with consequences to the ecosystems and human health through discarded CBs, SHS, and THS exposure.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the toxicity of amyloidogenic protein aggregates and designing therapeutic approaches require the knowledge of their structure at atomic resolution. Although solid-state NMR, X-ray diffraction, and other experimental techniques are capable of discerning the protein fibrillar structure, determining the structures of early aggregates, called oligomers, is a challenging experimental task. Computational studies by all-atom molecular dynamics, which provides a complete description of a protein in the solvent, are typically limited to study folding of smaller protein or aggregation of a small number of short protein fragments. We review an efficient ab initio computer simulation approach to protein folding and aggregation using discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) in combination with several coarse-grained protein models and implicit solvent. This approach involves different complexity levels in both the protein model and the interparticle interactions. Starting from the simplest protein model with minimal interactions, and gradually increasing its complexity, while guided by in vitro findings, we can systematically select the key features of the protein model and interactions that drive protein folding and aggregation. Because the method used in this DMD approach does not require any knowledge of the native or any other state of the protein, it can be applied to study degenerative disorders associated with protein misfolding and aberrant protein aggregation. The choice of the coarse-grained model depends on the complexity of the protein and specific questions to be addressed, which are mostly suggested by in vitro findings. Thus, we illustrate our approach on amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the simplifications introduced in the DMD approach, the predicted Abeta conformations are in agreement with existing experimental data. The in silico findings also provide further insights into the structure and dynamics of Abeta folding and oligomer formation that are amenable to in vitro testing.",

The aim of this essay is to review pertinent literature and present examples and recommendations from several decades of experience in the use of medical records in primary health care, in ways that can help primary care doctors to organize their work processes to improve patient care. Considerable problems have been noted to result from a lack of interoperability and standardization of interfaces among these systems, impairing the effective collaboration and information exchange in the care of complex patients. It is extremely important that regional and national health policies be established to assure standardization and interoperability of systems. Lack of interoperability contributes to the fragmentation of the information environment. The electronic medical record (EMR) is a disruptive technology that can revolutionize the way we care for patients. The EMR has been shown to improve quality and reliability in the delivery of healthcare services when appropriately implemented.  Careful attention to the impact of the EMR on clinical workflows, in order to take full advantage of the potential of the EMR to improve patient care, is the key lesson from our experience in the deployment and use of these systems.",

Here we have utilized sequence-specific proteases to dissect the role of defined antigenic variants in binding to particular receptors. By selection of protease-resistant subpopulations of parasites on defined receptors we (i) confirm the high rate of antigenic variation in vitro; (ii) demonstrate that a single infected erythrocyte can bind to intercellular adhesion molecule 1, CD36, and thrombospondin; (iii) show that binding to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and CD36 are functions of the variant antigen; and (iv) suggest that binding to thrombospondin may be mediated by other components of the infected erythrocyte surface.",

Our previous work found that erythritol, a nonnutritive polyol, has insecticidal properties to D. suzukii. Two formulations of erythritol (1.5M), with 0.5M sucrose or 0.1M sucralose, are most effective at killing D. suzukii. In this study, we investigated the nontarget effects of these erythritol formulations on honey bee Apis mellifera Linnaeus larvae, a pupal parasitoid of D. suzukii, Pachycrepoideus vindemiae Rondani, and western yellow jacket, Vespula pensylvanica Saussure. We directly exposed honey bee larvae by adding a high dose (2 µl) to larval cells and found no significant mortality from either formulation compared to the water control. Pachycrepoideus vindemiae may encounter erythritol in field settings when host plants of D. suzukii are sprayed. The erythritol+sucralose formulation was more detrimental than erythritol+sucrose to P. vindemiae, however, this effect was greatly reduced within a 21-d period when a floral source was present. Since yellow jackets are a nuisance pest and were attracted to the erythritol formulations in recent field trials, we tested adult V. pensylvanica survival with continuous consumption of these formulations in the laboratory. We found no detectable detriment from either formulation, compared to the sucrose control. Overall, both erythritol formulations caused minimal nontarget effects on honey bee larvae, P. vindemiae parasitoids, and western yellow jackets.",

As part of the technical analysis, potential future radiation doses are being calculated for workers at thermal treatment facilities and members of the public residing near such facilities. This study compared two types of thermal treatment systems: a conventional combustion chamber with excess air, represented by a rotary kiln with afterburner, and an oxygen-deficient pyrolysis unit, represented by a plasma arc furnace. The purpose of the first part of this study is to estimate the partitioning for significant radionuclides and elements in the two types of thermal treatment systems. Excess-air systems are generally found to produce heavy-metal chlorides, oxides, and sulfates; plasma-arc systems tend to produce more volatile free metals. This difference causes a change in source term dominance from halide volatility to free metal volatility. Chemical thermodynamic methodology is used to estimate partitioning in the two treatment systems. The second part of the study examines how the potential radiation dose to workers handling residue materials is affected by partitioning of radionuclides at the different types of facilities.",

Entropy maximization is also beset by multiple false solutions: electron-density maps are readily generated which satisfy the same Fourier amplitude constraints but have higher entropies than the true solution. We conclude that a successful ab initio approach must make use of high-resolution Fourier data and/or stronger chemical constraints. One such constraint is the connectivity of the macromolecule. We describe a rapid algorithm for measuring the connectivity of a map, and show its utility in reducing the multiplicity of solutions to the phase problem.",

We have compared the effect of FK506, a novel immunosuppressive agent, on the mucosal infiltration by T-cells and eosinophils with the well established drugs, nedocromil sodium and dexamethasone. Sensitized Hartley guinea-pigs were treated subcutaneously for 5 days with FK506 (100 micrograms.kg-1 daily), nedocromil sodium (30 micrograms.kg-1 daily), or dexamethasone (200 micrograms.kg-1 daily). On the day of the experiment, i.e. one week after the booster injection of antigen, the animals were killed, the lungs dissected, frozen and cryostat sections stained by immunohistochemical methods using monoclonal antibodies specific for total T-lymphocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Cyanide-resistant eosinophil peroxidase activity was used to stain the eosinophils. Sections were coded and positive cells enumerated in the lamina propria and adventitia of the bronchi. Sensitized and antigen-stimulated vehicle-treated guinea-pigs showed marked infiltration of the bronchial wall by CD4+ T-lymphocytes and eosinophils compared with sensitized, non-antigen stimulated animals. As compared to vehicle, FK506 or dexamethasone abolished the T-cell/eosinophil invasion in the bronchial wall, whereas nedocromil sodium was ineffective in protecting the lungs from T-lymphocyte or eosinophil infiltration. We conclude that both FK506 and dexamethasone are effective in curtailing bronchial inflammation in allergic guinea-pigs, whereas nedocromil sodium did not resolve the inflammation associated with T-lymphocytes or eosinophils.",

Jovian lightning is thought to be generated in the mixed-phase (liquid-ice) region of convective water clouds through a charge-separation process between condensed liquid water and water-ice particles, similar to that of terrestrial (cloud-to-cloud) lightning7-9. Unlike terrestrial lightning, which emits broadly over the radio spectrum up to gigahertz frequencies10,11, lightning on Jupiter has been detected only at kilohertz frequencies, despite a search for signals in the megahertz range 12 . Strong ionospheric attenuation or a lightning discharge much slower than that on Earth have been suggested as possible explanations for this discrepancy13,14. Here we report observations of Jovian lightning sferics (broadband electromagnetic impulses) at 600 megahertz from the Microwave Radiometer 15 onboard the Juno spacecraft. These detections imply that Jovian lightning discharges are not distinct from terrestrial lightning, as previously thought. In the first eight orbits of Juno, we detected 377 lightning sferics from pole to pole. We found lightning to be prevalent in the polar regions, absent near the equator, and most frequent in the northern hemisphere, at latitudes higher than 40 degrees north. Because the distribution of lightning is a proxy for moist convective activity, which is thought to be an important source of outward energy transport from the interior of the planet16,17, increased convection towards the poles could indicate an outward internal heat flux that is preferentially weighted towards the poles9,16,18. The distribution of moist convection is important for understanding the composition, general circulation and energy transport on Jupiter.",

        "abstract": "Human and animal physiology are subject to seasonal, lunar, and circadian rhythms. Although the seasonal and circadian rhythms have been fairly well described, little is known about the effects of the lunar cycle on the behavior and physiology of humans and animals. The lunar cycle has an impact on human reproduction, in particular fertility, menstruation, and birth rate. Melatonin levels appear to correlate with the menstrual cycle. Admittance to hospitals and emergency units because of various causes (cardiovascular and acute coronary events, variceal hemorrhage, diarrhea, urinary retention) correlated with moon phases. In addition, other events associated with human behavior, such as traffic accidents, crimes, and suicides, appeared to be influenced by the lunar cycle. However, a number of reports find no correlation between the lunar cycle and human reproduction and admittance to clinics and emergency units. Animal studies revealed that the lunar cycle may affect hormonal changes early in phylogenesis (insects). In fish the lunar clock influences reproduction and involves the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis. In birds, the daily variations in melatonin and corticosterone disappear during full-moon days. The lunar cycle also exerts effects on laboratory rats with regard to taste sensitivity and the ultrastructure of pineal gland cells. Cyclic variations related to the moon's phases in the magnitude of the humoral immune response of mice to polivinylpyrrolidone and sheep erythrocytes were also described. It is suggested that melatonin and endogenous steroids may mediate the described cyclic alterations of physiological processes. The release of neurohormones may be triggered by the electromagnetic radiation and/or the gravitational pull of the moon. Although the exact mechanism of the moon's influence on humans and animals awaits further exploration, knowledge of this kind of biorhythm may be helpful in police surveillance, medical practice, and investigations involving laboratory animals.",

Although three dimensional electron microscopy approaches like serial block face and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy and electron tomography allow volumetric reconstruction of podocytes, these techniques are very time-consuming and too specialized for routine use or screening purposes. During the last few years, different super-resolution microscopic techniques were developed to overcome the optical resolution limit enabling new insights into podocyte morphology. Super-resolution microscopy approaches like three dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM), stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) and localization microscopy [stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM)] reach resolutions down to 80-20 nm and can be used to image and further quantify podocyte foot process morphology. Furthermore, in vivo imaging of podocytes is essential to study the behavior of these cells in situ. Therefore, multiphoton laser microscopy was a breakthrough for in vivo studies of podocytes in transgenic animal models like rodents and zebrafish larvae because it allows imaging structures up to several hundred micrometer in depth within the tissue. Additionally, along with multiphoton microscopy, lightsheet microscopy is currently used to visualize larger tissue volumes and therefore image complete glomeruli in their native tissue context. Alongside plain visualization of cellular structures, atomic force microscopy has been used to study the change of mechanical properties of podocytes in diseased states which has been shown to be a culprit in podocyte maintenance. This review discusses recent advances in the field of microscopic imaging and demonstrates their currently used and other possible applications for podocyte research.",

Analysis of the assumptions underlying existing theory and research also provides a context for evaluating the psychology of men and masculinity as an evolving area of social scientific inquiry. The authors identify several theoretical and methodological obstacles that limit understanding of the variable ways that men do or do not seek help from mental and physical health care professionals. A contextual framework is developed by exploring how the socialization and social construction of masculinities transact with social psychological processes common to a variety of potential help-seeking contexts. This approach begins to integrate the psychology of men and masculinity with theory and methodology from other disciplines and suggests innovative ways to facilitate adaptive help seeking.",

        "abstract": "Recently, Missouri has followed an overall upward trend in opioid overdose deaths. In 2018, Missouri was the state with the largest absolute and percentage increase in opioid-related overdose fatality rates per capita over the previous year (18.3% and 3.1/100,000). This increase occurred despite an overall decrease in U.S. opioid-related death rates in the same period. This report identifies illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) (and analogues) as the drug most responsible for this rise in opioid deaths in Missouri, with stimulant overdoses (primarily from methamphetamine) in second place. Within Missouri, we find the areas where opioid deaths are highest: St. Louis and the city's fringe areas, following the national trend for high rates in fringe areas. Based on reports from CDC Wonder data, county medical examiners, law enforcement agencies, and drug addiction prevention agencies, we conclude that IMF and related synthetic opioids arriving from China are primarily responsible for fatal narcotic overdoses in Missouri. Despite the COVID-19 disruption of fentanyl manufacturing and distribution centers in and around Wuhan, China early in the pandemic, preliminary 2020 data from medical examiners' offices show an upswing in opioid deaths, an indicator that Chinese fentanyl producers have restored the supply chain.",

        "abstract": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) remain an important primary source of emission for endocrine-disrupting compounds in the environment. As an advanced wastewater treatment process, ozonation is known to reduce endocrine-disrupting activity. However, it remains unclear to which extend improved wastewater treatment may reduce the endocrine-disrupting activity in the receiving water body. The present study investigated possible factors for the endocrine-disrupting activity in a small receiving water body, the Wurm River (North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany), up- and downstream of a local WWTP. The cell-based reporter gene CALUX® assay was applied to identify the endocrine-disrupting activity in the water, sediment, and suspended particulate matter. The water phase and the effluent sampling were primarily driven by applying the full-scale effluent ozonation (sampling campaigns in June 2017 and March 2019). In contrast, the sediment sampling aimed to compare the particle-bound endocrine-disrupting activity during dry (June 2017) and rainy summer (June 2018) seasons. The water phase showed low to moderate estrogenic/antiandrogenic activity. Advanced effluent treatment by ozonation led to a complete reduction of the endocrine-disrupting activity according to the limit of detection of the CALUX® assays. The suspended particulate matter originated from the water phase of the second sampling campaign revealed antiandrogenic activity only. Sediments at the sampling sites along the local WWTP revealed higher estrogenic and antiandrogenic activity after extensive rain events and were not affected by the ozonated effluent. Fluctuation patterns of the endocrine-disrupting activity in sediments were in line with fluctuated concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Rainwater overflow basin release was suggested as a vector for particle-bound and dissolved endocrine-disrupting activity in the receiving water body. The present study underlined the necessity for monitoring both water and sediment phases to achieve reliable profiling of the endocrine-disrupting activity. The receptor-mediated CALUX® assays were proven to be suitable for investigating the endocrine-disrupting activity distribution in different river compartments and WWTP effluents.",

In addition to the previously reported QueMD sub-score (aMED), a sub-score for non-typical MD foods (ntMED, carbonated and/or sugar-sweetened beverages (soft drinks), butter, margarine, or cooking cream, and manufactured sweets, pastries, and cakes) was evaluated. Italian females had higher MED-55 and FNS scores, and a lower AUDIT score than Spaniards (p < 0.01). Students who stayed with their family (resident) were more adherent to MD than those who moved away from home. Resident Italians consumed less beer, hard liquors, and cocktails than Spaniards on Saturday nights (p < 0.01). There were negative correlations between AUDIT and QueMD (R squared: 0.137, p < 0.05), and AUDIT and ntMED (R squared: 0.201, p < 0.01) in Spaniards, however, there was no relationship between AUDIT and other MD scores. In conclusion, this pilot study suggests that non-typical MD foods and Saturday night consumptions, related to being far from home, have a great impact on alcohol consumption.",

An assessment of the ICRP's radiological protection system using the effective whole-body dose methodology is made. Present models, which should continue to be improved as the research data becomes available, do provide an adequate basis for regulatory authorities to decide whether authorization for a proposed disposal can be granted, since they provide a means of indicating whether maximum individual (critical groups) exposure limits are likely to be exceeded.

We have further investigated immunopathological changes in sensitized guinea pigs 2 or 24 h after antigenic challenge with ovalbumin. Lungs were resected, frozen and cryostat sections stained with monoclonal antibodies that recognize relevant guinea pig epitopes. Cyanide-resistant peroxidase activity was used to stain eosinophils. No further increase in T-lymphocytes or eosinophils was observed 2 h after challenge. At 24 h, a marked increase in EPO+ eosinophils was found, and this was accompanied by severe mucosal damage characterized by epithelial shedding and ulceration. The numbers of T-lymphocytes remained stable but a novel population of cells with the appearance of dendritic cells was seen in the bronchial wall. They were negative for macrophage markers but were strongly Class II positive. These findings suggest that antigenic challenge results in further recruitment of eosinophils, their activation and release of toxic substances to the epithelium. Furthermore, other cell types, possibly dendritic cells, are attracted to the bronchi and could play a role in maintaining allergic inflammation via antigen presentation.",

While these claims are usually based on probabilities, they are often resolved with the accepted claim treated as though it were \"true,\" while the rejected claim is treated as though it were \"false.\" Scenario-testing is the label applied to a set of procedures by which competing claims are evaluated as probabilistic scenarios. Resoluation of a proposition by scenario-testing requires that an accounting of each substantiated scenario be made.

RESOURCES INFORMATION CENTER (ERIC).\" ti Scenario-Testing: Decision Rules for Evaluating Conflicting Probabilistic Claims If there is a beginning point for this paper, it probably can be found in the evolution of arguments in recent policy topic debates. A few years ago there was a rare overlap between the High School and College resolutions. Many will recall the fairly \"stock\" Central American case which alleged the following: 1. Nicaragua is really a peace-loving nation. 2. The Nicaraguan military build-up is a response to U.S. military support/arms sales to its neighbors. 3. Curtailment of U.S. military intervention/arms sales to Central America would result in a negotiated settlement with Nicaragua. While the particulars would vary from case-to-case, the preceding outline was a typical case approach. An equally typical \"stock\" response to the Central American case was often found in the following: 1. Nicaragua is really a Cuban/Soviet puppet. 2. The Nicaraguan military build-up is a prelude to regional political and military domination. 3. Curtailment of U.S. military intervention/arms sales would deliver Central America to Nicaraguan domination. While this response also varied in case-by-case applications, it paralleled the sequence of claims made by the Affirmative advocate with fairly direct counterclaims. When confronted by these two disjunctive descriptions of reality in Central America, we, as debate critics, are forced to make a choice. If we accept the first description as true, we would almost invariably vote for the Affirmative. If we accepted the second, it would almost invariably result in a decision for the Negative.

Knowledge gaps include the shape of concentration-response curves and the lowest levels of exposure at which increased risks are evident and the occurrence and extent of associations with specific causes of death. Here, we applied improved estimates of exposure to ambient PM2.5 to national population-based cohorts in Canada, including a stacked cohort of 7.1 million people who responded to census year 1991, 1996, or 2001. The characterization of the shape of the concentration-response relationship for nonaccidental mortality and several specific causes of death at low levels of exposure was the focus of the Mortality-Air Pollution Associations in Low Exposure Environments (MAPLE) Phase 1 report. In the Phase 1 report we reported that associations between outdoor PM2.5 concentrations and nonaccidental mortality were attenuated with the addition of ozone (O3) or a measure of gaseous pollutant oxidant capacity (Ox), which was estimated from O3 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations. This was motivated by our interests in understanding both the effects air pollutant mixtures may have on mortality and also the role of O3 as a copollutant that shares common sources and precursor emissions with those of PM2.5. In this Phase 2 report, we further explore the sensitivity of these associations with O3 and Ox, evaluate sensitivity to other factors, such as regional variation, and present ambient PM2.5 concentration-response relationships for specific causes of death.",

One suggestion is that intermittent fasting attenuates an increase in appetite that typically accompanies weight loss. Here, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the effects of intermittent fasting on appetite, when compared to a continuous energy restriction intervention. Five electronic databases and trial registers were searched in February 2021 and February 2022. Abstracts (N = 2800) were screened and 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), consisting of a variety of intermittent fasting regimes, met our inclusion criteria. The total number of participants allocated to interventions was 1111 and all RCTs were judged as having either some concerns or a high risk of bias (Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool). Random effects meta-analyses were conducted on change-from-baseline appetite ratings. There was no clear evidence that intermittent fasting affected hunger (WMD = -3.03; 95% CI [-8.13, 2.08]; p = 0.25; N = 13), fullness (WMD = 3.11; 95% CI [-1.46, 7.69]; p = 0.18; N = 10), desire to eat (WMD = -3.89; 95% CI [-12.62, 4.83]; p = 0.38; N = 6), or prospective food consumption (WMD = -2.82; 95% CI [-3.87, 9.03]; p = 0.43; N = 5), differently to continuous energy restriction interventions.

Committed effective doses for the inhalation or ingestion of radionuclides by workers who are occupationally exposed were given in Publication 68 based on the most recent dosimetric and biokinetic models for adults. Additionally, a compilation of dose coefficients for both workers and members of the public has been issued on a CD-ROM. The present report complements that series by addressing doses to the embryo/fetus after intakes of radionuclides by a female member of the public or a female worker, before or during pregnancy. Ingestion and inhalation of selected radionuclides of the 31 elements for which age-dependent biokinetic models were provided in the previous reports are considered.

New biokinetic and dosimetric models for calculating doses to the developing embryo and fetus are developed and used in conjunction with the models for infants, children, and adults presented in the previous reports. The models used take account of transfer of radionuclides across the placenta, distribution and retention of radionuclides in fetal tissues, growth of the fetus, and photon irradiation from radionuclides in the placenta and maternal tissues. Human and animal data are used as available in the development of these models. Intake scenarios comprising single or continuous maternal intakes are taken into account in the compilation of effective dose coefficients following ingestion or inhalation of the radionuclides considered. A CD-ROM with more comprehensive information on doses from inhalation of different particle sizes, tissue doses, and doses at various times after birth has been developed concurrently with the report and will be available shortly. The report does not consider doses to the offspring due to intakes of radionuclides in maternal milk and external irradiation from the mother's body after birth.

Parameters important to generic simulations of food chain transport, given a known constant deposition onto vegetation, include: fractional interception of particulates by vegetation, vegetation density, effective half-life of contamination on vegetation, soil-to-plant transfer factors, consumption rates by cattle and man, and transfer of nuclides from forage to meat and from forage to milk. Variation in these parameters, which has been encountered in field studies, is summarized. A partial reduction in the variation of predicted concentrations of actinides in foods can be accomplished by more accurately determining critical parameter values like fractional interception of deposition by vegetation, vegetation biomass, and the effective half-life of contamination on vegetation. Field research describing the site dependency and time dependency of probability density functions for model parameter values is needed to make probabilistic predictions concerning Pu, U, and Th transport in food chains and to reduce the uncertainty associated with model predictions and generic assessments of environmental impact.",

        "abstract": "Basic mathematical descriptions are useful in phage ecology, applied phage ecology such as in the course of phage therapy, and also toward keeping track of expected phage-bacterial interactions as seen during laboratory manipulation of phages. The most basic mathematical descriptor of phages is their titer, that is, their concentration within stocks, experimental vessels, or other environments. Various phenomena can serve to modify phage titers, and indeed phage titers can vary as a function of how they are measured. An important aspect of how changes in titers can occur results from phage interactions with bacteria. These changes tend to vary in degree as a function of bacterial densities within environments, and particularly densities of those bacteria that are susceptible to or at least adsorbable by a given phage type. Using simple mathematical models one can describe phage-bacterial interactions that give rise particularly to phage adsorption events. With elaboration one can consider changes in both phage and bacterial densities as a function of both time and these interactions. In addition, phages along with their impact on bacteria can be considered as spatially constrained processes. In this chapter we consider the simpler of these concepts, providing in particular detailed verbal explanations toward facile mathematical insight. The primary goal is to stimulate a more informed use and manipulation of phages and phage populations within the laboratory as well as toward more effective phage application outside of the laboratory, such as during phage therapy. More generally, numerous issues and approaches to the quantification of phages are considered along with the quantification of individual, ecological, and applied properties of phages.",

Assuming a 1 Ci/yr release to surface waters, this individual might receive a dose rate of 1.5 x 10/sup -5/ mrem/yr. The dose rate to the population of the world including the United Sates and the regional population was estimated to be 1 x 10/sup -2/ man-rem/yr from the release to the atmosphere and 6 x 10/sup -2/ man-rem/yr from the release to surface waters. Dose rates from releases of 1 Ci/yr /sup 14/C to the atmosphere were estimated to be 0.4 mrem/yr to the bone of the hypothetical maximum individual and 2 man-rem/yr to the total body of the world population. Because of the persistence of /sup 14/C in the environment and the fact that carbon is a major constituent of any living thing, efforts should be made to eliminate those releases with available technology such as double containment of the reactors to prevent air leakage.",

        "abstract": "Illicit trafficking of fissionable material in container cargoes is recognized as a potential weakness in Nuclear Security. Triggered by the attacks of 11 September 2001, measures were undertaken to enhance maritime security in extension to the Safety Of Life At Sea Convention and in line with the US Container Security Initiatives. Effective detection techniques are needed that allow the inspector to intercept illicit trafficking of nuclear weapons components or components of other nuclear explosive devices. Many security measures focus on active interrogation of the container content by X-ray scan, which might be extended with the newly developed tagged neutron inspection system. Both active interrogation techniques can, with the current huge volume of container traffic, only be applied to a limited number of selected containers. The question arises whether a passive detection technique can offer an alternative solution. This study investigates if containers equipped with a small passive detector will register during transport the neutron irradiation by fissionable material such as plutonium in a measurable way. In practice, 4/5 of the containers are about 1/8 filled with hydrogenous material and undergo a typical 2 months route. For this reference case, it was found that the most compatible passive detector would be an activation foil of iridium. Monte-Carlo simulations showed that for the reference case the activity of a 250 microm thin foil with 6 cm(2) cross-section would register 1.2 Bq when it is irradiated by a significant quantity of Reactor-Grade PuO(2). However this activity drops with almost two orders of magnitude for other fillings and other isotopic compositions and forms of the Pu-source. The procedure of selecting the target material for Pu detection is detailed with the theoretical methods, in order to be useful for other applications. Moreover the value of such additional passive sensors for securing maritime container transport is situated within the global framework of the First, Second and Third Line of Defense against illicit trafficking.",

        "abstract": "Hair care and treatment has evolved significantly through the years as new formulations are continuously being explored in an attempt to meet the demand in cosmetic and medicinal fields. While standard hair care procedures include hair washing, aimed at hair cleansing and maintenance, as well as hair dyeing and bleaching formulations for hair embellishment, modern hair treatments are mainly focused on circumventing hair loss conditions, strengthening hair follicle properties and treat hair infestations. In this regard, active compounds (ACs) included in hair cosmetic formulations include a vast array of hair cleansing and hair dye molecules, and typical hair treatments include anti-hair loss ACs (e.g. minoxidil and finasteride) and anti-lice ACs (e.g. permethrin). However, several challenges still persist, as conventional AC formulations exhibit sub-optimal performance and some may present toxicity issues, calling for an improved design of formulations regarding both efficacy and safety. More recently, nano-based strategies encompassing nanomaterials have emerged as promising tailored approaches to improve the performance of ACs incorporated into hair cosmetics and treatment formulations. The interest in using these nanomaterials is based on account of their ability to: (1) increase stability, safety and biocompatibility of ACs; (2) maximize hair affinity, contact and retention, acting as versatile biointerfaces; (3) enable the controlled release of ACs in both hair and scalp, serving as prolonged AC reservoirs; besides offering (4) hair follicle targeting features attending to the possibility of surface tunability. This review covers the breakthrough of nanomaterials for hair cosmetics and hair treatment, focusing on organic nanomaterials (polymer-based and lipid-based nanoparticles) and inorganic nanomaterials (nanosheets, nanotubes and inorganic nanoparticles), as well as their applications, highlighting their potential as innovative multifunctional nanomaterials towards maximized hair care and treatment. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This manuscript is focused on reviewing the nanotechnological strategies investigated for hair care and treatment so far. While conventional formulations exhibit sub-optimal performance and some may present toxicity issues, the selection of improved and suitable nanodelivery systems is of utmost relevance to ensure a proper active ingredient release in both hair and scalp, maximize hair affinity, contact and retention, and provide hair follicle targeting features, warranting stability, efficacy and safety. This innovative manuscript highlights the advantages of nanotechnology-based approaches, particularly as tunable and versatile biointerfaces, and their applications as innovative multifunctional nanomaterials towards maximized hair care and treatment.",

        "abstract": "Everything included in this overview is a list of facts without analyses, which makes this a purely factual overview. The circumstances of the preparation for the foundation of the Croatian Dermatovenereological Society - the Croatian Medical Association (hereafter CDS-CMA) and the journal Acta Dermatovenerologica Croatica (hereafter ADC) Geopolitical changes in former Yugoslavia following 1990 and the Homeland War (1991-1995) led to new circumstances in almost all areas of social activity and the need for a restructuring and further development of professional physicians associations in our Homeland. In such new conditions, it was necessary to appropriately organize the professional work of our dermatovenerologists with the aim of founding and maintaining their professional ties to each other and to our colleagues abroad. The aforementioned appropriate organization primarily meant the founding of the Croatian Dermatological Society and the journal for Croatian dermatovenerologists, the first professional journal in the history of dermatology and venerology in our Homeland. Legal regulations for the founding of CDS-CMA and the journal ADC The legal regulations resulted from the conclusions and decisions of the 99th annual assembly of the Association of Croatian Physicians (hereafter ACP) that took place on the 26th of February 1991 (1), at which, at the suggestion of Prof. Mirko Gjurašin, PhD, the president of CMA, it was renamed to the Croatian Medical Association (CMA). Furthermore, on the basis of article 12 of the Statute of CMA, the creation and activity of professional societies of CMA was enabled, which replaced the Sections of ACP (1), and soon there appeared the Regulation of the work of the professional society of CMA. Finally, on the 30th of September 1991, CMA left the Alliance of Yugoslav Medical Societies (1). More detailed information on the aforementioned events can be found in reference 1, and the data on historical, political, national, and military aspects of the war against our Homeland can be found in the article of the esteemed member of CMA, Prof. Eduard Klain, PhD (2) and in the message by Prof. Vladimir Čajkovac, PhD (3). Preparations for the founding of CDS-CMA and ADC Ideas concerning a new founding of the Croatian Dermatological Society - CMA (hereafter CDS-CMA) and the first journal in the history of Croatian dermatovenerologists developed during 1990 and 1991. These suggestions were discussed in the meetings of the Professional college of the Department of Dermatology and Venerology at the Clinical Hospital Centre Zagreb (hereafter CHC Zagreb), and were formed at the meeting of the Professional college of the Department on the 27th of January 1992, when the Professional college provided the following suggestions, which the secretary of the Dermatovenerological Section of CMA (Primarius D. Paljan, MD, MSc) gave to the president of the Dermatovenerological section of CMA, Prof. V. Čajkovac, PhD. The suggestions were as follows: 1) for the Dermatovenerological section of CMA to leave the Association of Yugoslav dermatologists; 2) to found a Croatian Dermatological Society; 3) to found a Croatian Journal of Dermatology; and 4) to inform colleagues from clinics abroad with the state in Croatia. Of course, Prof. Čajkovac immediately agreed with all of these suggestions. Afterwards, on the 9th of October 1991, I presented the members of the Professional college of the Department of Dermatology and Venerology of CHC Zagreb and the members of the Chair of Dermatovenerology at the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb (hereafter SM Univ. of Zagreb), with the suggestions regarding the founding of the Croatian Dermatological Society - CMA and the founding of a Journal of Croatian Dermatologists (4,5). Both suggestions were accepted unanimously (4). After accepting the abovementioned suggestions, my colleagues and I undertook a number of consultations, and from the Department of Dermatology and Venerology of CHC Zagreb I sent out invitations to all the members of the Dermatovenerological Section of ACP (hereafter Section) to a meeting in the lecture room of the Clinic on Šalata, scheduled for the 29th of May 1992 (6). At that meeting, I notified the members of the Section of the decisions made at the 99th annual assembly of CMA on the 26th of February 1991, as well as of the fact that the CMA had left the Alliance of Yugoslav Physicians Societies on the 30th of September 1991 (6). Also, following the example of many other medical professions, I told the members of the Section about my suggestion regarding the founding of CDS-CMA. Therefore, on the 29th of May 1992, CDS-CMA was founded again* (6). On that occasion, a temporary Board of directors of CDS-CMA was also chosen, and Prof. Vladimir Čajkovac, who was the president of the former Dermatovenerological Section of ACP, was chosen as the president of the Board (6), while the following were chosen as members of the Board (6): Primarius Zlatka Čabrijan, MD (Rijeka), Adalbert Stašić, MSc, MD (Rijeka), Assist. Prof. Vjekoslav Stipić, PhD (Split), Primarius Boris Petričić, MD (Zadar), Prof. Ivan Dobrić, PhD (Zagreb), Assist. Prof. Teodora Gregurek-Novak,PhD (Zagreb), Primarius Jasna Lesić, PhD (Zagreb), and Primarius Aida Pašić, MD (Zagreb). Titles according to the state in 1992. *Why was CDS-CMA founded again? To understand this question, it is important to know the following: a) On the 22nd of November 1920, the Dermatological Section of the Physicians Association (7) was founded in the Hospital Sestre milosrdnice, Zagreb, Croatia (quotation from reference 7); b) this Section acted until the 19th of January 1941, when a formal session was held in the lecture room of the Clinic on Šalata under the title of the 1st (jubilee) meeting of the Croatian Dermatovenerological Society of the Croatian Medical Association, which was opened by its president, Prof. Kogoj (7); c) therefore, it is apparent that the Croatian Dermatovenerological Society of the Croatian Medical Association was founded on the 19th of January 1941, and the forerunner of the Society was the former Dermatological Section of the Physicians Association (7); the name Croatian Dermatovenerological Society of CMA has been used in professional publications since then (8); d) at the extraordinary session of the Croatian Physicians Society (probably a reference to ACP) held on the 30th of September 1945, the name of the Association of Croatian Physicians was changed to the name Croatian Medical Association, and since then the Croatian Dermatovenerological Society has appeared in professional publications under the name of the Dermatovenerological Society of the Croatian Medical Association (9); e) later the name Dermatovenerological Society - CMA was replaced with the name Dermatovenerological Section of ACP, but I am not familiar with the exact date of this change; f) the name Dermatovenerological Section of ACP existed until the 29th of May 1992, when, as it was stated above, the CDS-CMA was founded (6). NOTE: The original name of the Society founded on the 29th of May 1992 was the Croatian Dermatological Society of the Croatian Medical Association (CDS-CMA), and later this name was changed to the Croatian Dermatovenerological Society of the Croatian Medical Association (CDVS-CMA), which is the name used by the Society nowadays. The election of the Assembly and the regular Board of Directors of CDS-CMA On the 10th of July 1992, in the same lecture room in which the meeting was held on the 29th of May 1992, there was a meeting on the newly founded CDS-CMA (6). According to the book of regulations of the CMA, which was established over time, the Assembly of CDS-CMA was elected, and at the suggestion of the Assembly the following attending colleagues were elected to the regular Board of Directors of CDS-CMA, along with Prof. Vladimir Čajkovac as the president (6): Primarius Zlatka Čabrijan, MD (Rijeka), Adalbert Stašić, MD, MSc (Rijeka), Assist. Prof. Vjekoslav Stipić, PhD (Split), Primarius Boris Petričić, MD (Zadar), Prof. Ivan Dobrić, PhD (Zagreb), Assist. Prof. Teodora Gregurek-Novak, PhD (Zagreb), Primarius Jasna Lesić, PhD (Zagreb), and Primarius Aida Pašić, MD (Zagreb). Titles according to the state in 1992. Branches of CDS-CMA As we can see, colleagues from all university centers existing at the time (Osijek, Rijeka, Split, and Zagreb) were elected to the Board of Directors, in which Branches of CDS-CMA were later founded. Therefore, from the beginning of the creation of CDS-CMA, it has been our goal to found CDS-CMA with four Branches (Osijek, Rijeka, Split, and Zagreb), which is how the Society is structured even today. NOTE: Since there were no representatives from Osijek at the meeting held on the 10th of September 1992, the Assembly suggested that the president of CDS-CMA-Osijek Branch enter the Board of Directors after the Branch is founded (6). The election of the president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer of CDS-CMA Through a secret ballot, the members of the Assembly elected the following from among the members of the Board of Directors to a term of four years (6): Prof. Vladimir Čajkovac, PhD as the president of the Board of Directors of CDS-CMA (on the basis of the accepted work program), Prof. Ivan Dobrić, PhD and Assist. Prof. Vjekoslav Stipić, PhD as the vice president of the Board, Primarius Zlatka Čabrijan, MD and Assist. Prof. Teodora Gregurek-Novak, PhD as secretaries, and Primarius Aida Pašić, MD as the treasurer of the Board of Directors of CDS-CMA. The founding of the ADC and its organizational overview from Vol 1, No 1 to Vol 4, No 2 At the aforementioned meeting of CDS-CMA held on the 10th of July 1992 (6), I presented my suggestions from the 9th of October 1990 (4), which were accepted by the members of the Professional college of the Clinical Hospital Centre Zagreb and the members of the Department of Dermatovenerology of the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, regarding the need for founding a Journal of Croatian Dermatovenerologists, i.e. a journal of CDS entitled Acta Dermatovenerologica Croatica (ADC) (4). I remind the reader that the need for founding a \"professional publication\" (quotation from reference 7) was expressed as early as 1920, at the founding of the Dermatological Section of ACP (7). The election of the management of the Journal Acta Dermatovenerologica Croatica At the meeting held on the 10th of July 1992, the following were elected to the management of Acta Dermatovenerologica Croatica (with no titles): Vladimir Čajkovac as the chief editor (with the instruction that he should choose his own co-workers) (6). Several days after the meeting of the 10th of July 1992, the following colleagues were appointed to certain positions in the journal: Ivan Dobrić as the deputy to the chief editor, Dragomir Budimčić as the technical editor, and Branko Baričević as the secretary of the journal. However, Dr. Budimčić resigned, so Branka Marinović was appointed to his position from Vol 1, No 4. After Dr. Baričević left for a position in diplomacy, Branka Marinović was elected to his position in the journal from Vol 4, No 2, while Mirna Šitum was elected to fill in the former position of Branka Marinović from Vol 4, No 2. Following the election of the journal's management and after certain consultations in the country and abroad were completed, members of the Editorial board* and the Editorial council** were also elected, as well as the language consultant and the translator for the English language***. *, **, ***: names and surnames of the elected colleagues are visible in the imprint of the listed volumes and issues of the journal. The titles of the particular colleagues are not included, with only the names and surnames stated (according to the statements in the journal's imprint) Addresses and the journal's office Addresses: - for Vol 1, No 1: Acta Dermatovenerologica Croatica, Department of Skin and Venereal Diseases of the Hospital Sestre milosrdnice, Vinogradska cesta 29, Zagreb, Croatia; - from Vol 1, No 2: Acta Dermatovenerologica Croatica, Department of Dermatology and Venerology, Clinical Hospital Centre Zagreb and School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, Šalata 4, Zagreb, Croatia* (see detailed information in the imprint of the listed volume and issues of the journal). The journal office Until Vol 3, No 1-2, the journal office was located on the abovementioned addresses. From Vol 3, No 1-2, a special journal office was founded, and the office manager was Ivan Dobrić, the former deputy of the chief editor, with Aleksandra Basta-Juzbašić being elected to take over Dr. Dobrić's former position from Vol 4, No 1. I. Dobrić performed the duties of the office manager until Vol 3, No 4, when this position was removed, and from Vol 4, No 1 the journal's office is yet again listed with the abovementioned address of the journal*. With the removal of the duties of the manager of the journal office, i.e. since Vol 3, No 4 (end of 1995), Prof. Dobrić no longer performed any duties in the journal, and this remains so to this day. The reason for the founding of the abovementioned office of the journal: chief editor Prof. Vladimir Čajkovac, PhD was also the head of the Department of Dermatology and Venerology of the School of Dental Medicine, University of Zagreb, and also worked in the Hospital Sestre milosrdnice, Vinogradska cesta 29, Zagreb. However, all the duties connected to the journal (preparation, correspondence, fax, requesting article reviews, sending notifications, contacting the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, contacting Clinical Hospital Centre Zagreb, contacting the printing office) were performed by the head office of the Department of Dermatology and Venerology at the Clinical Hospital Centre Zagreb and the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, which was, of course, tied to the expenses. Those expenses were charged to the Clinical Hospital Centre Zagreb, but for the purposes of booking the expenses, an agreement was reached with the Directorate of Clinical Hospital Centre Zagreb, according to which the expenses were booked to the journal's office and approved by the manager of the journal's office, who was then also the head of the Department, in accordance with the powers of the head of the Department according to the Temporary decision regarding the organization of Clinical Hospital Centre Zagreb from 1991. To conclude, the existence of the journal's office and its manager was of a purely pragmatic nature at the time. (For the purposes of verifying the accuracy of the abovementioned information see the imprint of the listed volumes and issues of the journal.) The first issue of ADC (Vol 1, No 1) The first issue of the journal was published at Christmas time in 1992 (10), and It was printed in Zagrebačka tiskara (which was later renamed to Grafoplast), Preradovićeva 21-23, Zagreb. The journal's expenses were covered from the following: a) membership fees for CDS-CMA; b) donations, or subscriptions to the journal of pharmaceutical companies; c) financial support of the Ministry of Science (for the year 1994); d) the help of the Directorate of Clinical Hospital Centre Zagreb; and e) financial assets from the research task \"Lyme borreliosis\" (leader: Prof. Dobrić). All financial business of the journal was performed through the account of the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb. Indexing the journal Thanks to all the authors who sent in their articles to our journal as well as the reviewers from our country and abroad, from January 1994 Acta Dermatovenerologica Croatica is included in the Excerpta Medica Embase database. In April 1993, the journal was already a candidate for the inclusion in Current Contents. See the letter from the institute for Scientific Information, Philadelphia, USA, dated 8th of April 1993, Mrs. Helen Szigeti, Publication Selection (Figure 2). Special thanks In the name of former associates, I extend a special thank you for the preparation for the founding of CDS-CMA to the following: a) All members of the Department and Clinic for Dermatology and Venerology of Clinical Hospital Centre Zagreb and the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb (who are listed in reference 5), as well as all colleagues from the former Dermatovenerological Section of ACP who accepted the invitation to the meeting held on the 29th of May 1992. Of course, I hereby also extend my gratitude to all those colleagues who did not attend that meeting, but explained their absence in a way that was then appropriate; b) Prof. Klaus Wolff, MD, the president of the Executive Board of the International League of Dermatological Societies, who allowed me to follow the work of the Assembly of Delegates of the International League of Dermatological Societies as a delegate of CDS-CMA (on the basis of a previously signed agreement) (New York, the 15th of July 1992); c) Prof. Stuart Maddin, MD, the general secretary of the Executive Board of the International League of Dermatological Societies, who I met with in New York some time before the beginning of the abovementioned Assembly. On that occasion, Prof. Maddin gave me many useful pieces of advice on the work of CDS-CMA and ADC (11). NOTE: Prof. Mario Gligora, PhD (an active participant at the 18th World Congress of Dermatology, New York, 1992, 12-18 June) also visited New York at that time, with whom I discussed at length, as I had done on numerous occasions prior to that, the future work of CDS-CMA and ADC, and his advice on the founding of CDS-CPA and ADC, which I presented on preparatory meetings to my colleagues, were very useful for my co-workers and myself when founding the Society and the journal; d) For everything stated above, I extend a special thank you to Prof. Mario Gligora, PhD Of course, certain pleasant events come at the very end, in order that we remember them for as long as possible. I wish here to extend special gratitude for the founding of CDS-CMA to Prof. Vladimir Čajkovac, PhD, the president of the former Dermatovenerological Section of ACP, who, after the renaming of ACP to CPA, which created the conditions for the founding of CDS-CMA and the journal ADC, always helped us with useful advice and eagerly supported each of our abovementioned initiatives. All collaboration with Prof. Čajkovac was very pleasant and useful. We repaid his favor by nominating him and electing him to the position of the first president of CDS-CMA and the first chief editor of ADC. To conclude, this article gives an overview of the important data on the founding of CDS-CMA (later CDVS-CMA) as well as the important information on ADC (until Vol 4, No 2). On my behalf and on the behalf of all my co-workers, I extend my congratulations for their achievements to everyone who continued working in CDS-CPA (later CDVS-CMA) and the journal ADC (after Vol 4, No 2), which is nowadays indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), Index Medicus/Medline, Embase/Excerpta Medica, Chemical Abstracts Service, Biomedicina Croatica (see ADC Vol 21, No 3, 2013). I hope the current president of the CDVS-CMA, Prof. Mirna Šitum, PhD, as well as the current chief editor of ADC, Prof. Branka Marinović, PhD, who is also the general secretary of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venerology, will enjoy many new achievements in our CDVS-CMA and the journal ADC. It is unnecessary to emphasize the importance of the fact that we have such a respectable journal in our Homeland. NOTE: The honorable duty of preparing this text was entrusted to me by the president of the CDVS-CMA, Prof. Mirna Šitum, PhD, at the meeting of the Executive Board of CDVS-CMA held on the 16th of April 2012 (for the purposes of an oral presentation of this data at the 3rd Croatian Congress of Psychodermatology with international participation, Split, 4-7 October, 2012, and again at the meeting of the Executive Board of CDVS-CMA, held on the 7th of June 2013 for the purposes of the web page of CDVS-CMA).",

        "abstract": "A three-compartment physical model is devised for transepithelial passive transport across intestinal cells. The mathematical equations derived from the model allow the simultaneous and quantitative measurements, in the form of permeability coefficients, of solute transport across both the luminal-serosal and serosal-blood barriers. The proposed model is used to study the involvement of the cytoskeleton in butyric acid absorption by the rat jejunum. Alterations in cytoskeletal functions are introduced by the administration of microfilamentous and microtubular altering agents such as cytochalasin, colchicine, or EDTA. An isolated jejunal segment perfused with a buffer containing labeled butyric acid was homogenized at the end of the experiment and assayed for its butyric acid content. During the perfusion, portal blood samples, as well as perfusate samples collected 10 cm distal to the perfusion site were drawn at 5-min intervals and assayed for their radioactivity. Cytochalasin was found to decrease the permeability of the mucosal membrane to butyric acid and to increase that of the serosal membrane. Colchicine did not have any effect either on the mucosal or on the serosal side. Cytochalasin and colchicine, when given in the same experiment, increased the permeability of the serosal membrane to butyric acid, but were without any effect on the mucosal barrier. Also, EDTA had no effect on the mucosal side, but decreased significantly the permeability of the serosal membrane to the fatty acid.",

This article lays out major gaps in our knowledge of interrelationships between brain metabolism and brain function, including biochemical, cellular, and subcellular aspects of functional metabolism and its imaging in adult brain, as well as during development, aging, and disease. The focus is on unknowns in metabolism of major brain substrates and associated transporters, the roles of insulin and of lipid droplets, the emerging role of metabolism in microglia, mysteries about the major brain cofactor and signaling molecule NAD+, as well as unsolved problems underlying brain metabolism in pathologies such as traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and metabolic downregulation during hibernation. It describes our current level of understanding of these facets of brain energy metabolism as well as a roadmap for future research.",

In 1999, weekly videoconferences began with remote laboratories and clinical staff in four peripheral hospitals and the Royal Brisbane Hospital and in 2000 biweekly videoconference pathology grand rounds started across Queensland with up to six sites, from Cairns to the Gold Coast, joining in or presenting. The average number of sites connected was 3.0 in 1998, 3.5 in 1999, 4.4 in 2000 and 4.5 in 2001. Problems included the complexity of the system, timing and need for bookings, coordination of presenters and presentations, and the time needed to organize sessions, set up linkages, advertise sessions and attend the telepathology conference. Successful meetings have been associated with well prepared cases, time for discussion, attendance by all sites, timeliness of cases and responses, and the presence of experts to respond to questions, as well as effective linkages and trouble-free hardware. Future needs include better infrastructure and trained staff to coordinate the linkages and presentations. Telepathology has an important part to play in the provision of cost-effective medical care in Queensland.",

        "abstract": "Computationally designed protein nanoparticles have recently emerged as a promising platform for the development of new vaccines and biologics. For many applications, secretion of designed nanoparticles from eukaryotic cells would be advantageous, but in practice, they often secrete poorly. Here we show that designed hydrophobic interfaces that drive nanoparticle assembly are often predicted to form cryptic transmembrane domains, suggesting that interaction with the membrane insertion machinery could limit efficient secretion. We develop a general computational protocol, the Degreaser, to design away cryptic transmembrane domains without sacrificing protein stability. The retroactive application of the Degreaser to previously designed nanoparticle components and nanoparticles considerably improves secretion, and modular integration of the Degreaser into design pipelines results in new nanoparticles that secrete as robustly as naturally occurring protein assemblies. Both the Degreaser protocol and the nanoparticles we describe may be broadly useful in biotechnological applications.",

Ample evidence has depicted an essential role for ferroptosis as either the cause or consequence for human diseases, denoting the likely therapeutic promises for targeting ferroptosis in the preservation of human health. Ferritinophagy, a selective form of autophagy, contributes to the initiation of ferroptosis through degradation of ferritin, which triggers labile iron overload (IO), lipid peroxidation, membrane damage, and cell death. In this review, we will delineate the role of ferritinophagy in ferroptosis, and its underlying regulatory mechanisms, to unveil the therapeutic value of ferritinophagy as a target in the combat of ferroptosis to manage metabolic diseases.",

However, the strong hydrophobicity, short half-life, low bioavailability and weak in vivo targeting ability of ELE restrict its use. Targeted drug delivery systems based on nanomaterials are among the most viable methods to overcome these shortcomings. In this review, we first summarize recent studies on the clinical uses of ELE as an adjunct antitumour drug. ELE-based combination strategies have great promise for enhancing efficacy, reducing adverse reactions, and improving patients' quality of life and immune function. Second, we summarize recent studies on the antitumour mechanisms of ELE and ELE-based combination strategies. The potential mechanisms include inducing pyroptosis and ferroptosis, promoting senescence, regulating METTL3-mediated m6A modification, suppressing the Warburg effect, and inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Most importantly, we comprehensively summarize studies on the combination of targeted drug delivery systems with ELE, including passively and actively targeted drug delivery systems, stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems, and codelivery systems for ELE combined with other therapies, which have great promise in improving drug bioavailability, increasing drug targeting ability, controlling drug release, enhancing drug efficacy, reducing drug adverse effects and reversing MDR. Our summary will provide a reference for the combination of TCMs such as ELE with advanced targeted drug delivery systems in the future.",

These data have been compared with 814 published modern whole genomes2,16,17,18 and with relevant published ancient sequences (> 1,800 samples).19 These analyses showed some evidence that the non-sub-Saharan genetic ancestry component of the Fulani might have also been shaped by older events,1,5,6 possibly tracing the Fulani origins to unsampled ancient Green Saharan population(s). The joint analysis of modern and ancient samples allowed us to shed light on the genetic ancestry composition of such ancient Saharans, suggesting a similarity with Late Neolithic Moroccans and possibly pointing to a link with the spread of cattle herding.

Despite the development of advanced materials and the configuration improvements of MD units, membrane surface modification is still one of the alternatives to overcome temperature polarization and improve membrane performance. This work reports a novel and simple method to modify the physical and chemical properties of the polypropylene membrane in order to improve its performance in direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD). The membrane was grafted by polymerization with 1-hexene, UV irradiation, and benzophenone as a photoinitiator. A grafting degree of up to 41% was obtained under UV irradiation for 4 h. The performance of the modified membrane in DCMD was evaluated at different temperatures and salt concentrations in the feed. First, it was found that there was an increase of the vapor permeate flux in the MD process within the range of tested temperatures and salt concentrations. The results were analyzed in terms of the physical properties of the membrane, the transport phenomena, and the thermal efficiency of the process. Theoretical analysis of the results indicated that grafting increased the transfer coefficients of mass and heat of the membrane. Hence, it improved the membrane performance and the thermal efficiency of the DCMD process.",

We found that BODIPY dimers (2,2'-, 2,3'-3,3'-CH2-bis(BODIPY) (1-3)) demonstrate fluorescence characteristics with a high sensitivity to the presence of polar solvents. The intense fluorescence of 1-3 in nonpolar/low-polarity solvents is dramatically quenched in polar media (acetone, DMF, and DMSO). It has been established that the main reason for CH2-bis(BODIPY) fluorescence quenching is the specific solvation of dyes by electron-donating molecules (Solv) with the formation of stable supramolecular CH2-bis(BODIPY)·2Solv structures. Using steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, and computational modeling, the formation mechanism, composition, and structure of CH2-bis(BODIPY)·2Solv supramolecular complexes have been substantiated, and their stability has been evaluated. The results show the promise of developing fluorescent probes based on CH2-bis(BODIPY)s for detecting toxic N/O-containing compounds in solutions.",

This exciting new book examines discourse on foreign economic policy to determine the impact of globalisation across the ideological landscape of British politics. The book critically interrogates the assumption that the idea of globalisation is derivative solely of neo-liberal ideology by profiling the discourse on globalisation of five political groups involved in making and contesting British foreign economic policy between 1997 and 2009: New Labour, International Financial Services London, the Liberal Democrats, Oxfam and the Socialist Workers Party. In addition to the relationship between neo-liberalism and globalisation, it also explores the core meaning of the idea of globalisation, the implications for the principle of free trade, the impact on notions of the state, nation-state and global governance, and whether globalisation means different things across the ideological spectrum. Topically, the book examines how the responses to the global financial crisis have been shaped by globalisation discourse and the value of ideology as an analytical concept able to mitigate debates on the primacy of material and ideational explanations in political economy. It will be of vital use to students and scholars of global economic change, financial crisis, the state, the impact of globalisation on national governance, and those interested in ideological change.",

Empirical findings exemplify that the digital economy remarkably reduces local carbon emissions, with the positive spatial spill over effects being salient. The spatial moderating effect model uncover that globalization positively affects the nexus between the digital economy and carbon emissions. Interestingly, the spatial panel threshold model designates that the digital economy's reduction effect on local carbon emissions will be tightened, whereas the positive spatial spill over effects turn negative only when globalization surpasses a threshold.

In contrast with natural IL-4, Neo-4 is hyperstable and signals exclusively through the type I IL-4 receptor complex, providing previously inaccessible insights into differential IL-4 signaling through type I versus type II receptors. Because of their hyperstability, our computationally designed mimetics can directly incorporate into sophisticated biomaterials that require heat processing, such as three-dimensional-printed scaffolds.

The role of a complex interplay of structure and agency in the development of modern science, not just in India but in Britain too is analysed. The role of science and technology in the incorporation of South Asian into the modern world system, as well as the consequences of the emergent structures in understanding the trajectory of modern science in post-colonial India is examined. Overall, colonial rule did not simply diffuse modern science from the core to the periphery. Rather the colonial encounter led to the development of new forms of scientific knowledge and institutions both in the periphery and the core.",

        "abstract": "For the purpose of this review, 'time-lapse' refers to the reconstruction of ancestral (in this case dinosaur) karyotypes using genome assemblies of extant species. Such reconstructions are only usually possible when genomes are assembled to 'chromosome level' i.e. a complete representation of all the sequences, correctly ordered contiguously on each of the chromosomes. Recent paleontological evidence is very clear that birds are living dinosaurs, the latest example of dinosaurs emerging from a catastrophic extinction event. Non-avian dinosaurs (ever present in the public imagination through art, and broadcast media) emerged some 240 million years ago and have displayed incredible phenotypic diversity. Here we report on our recent studies to infer the overall karyotype of the Theropod dinosaur lineage from extant avian chromosome level genome assemblies. Our work first focused on determining the likely karyotype of the avian ancestor (most likely a chicken-sized, two-legged, feathered, land dinosaur from the Jurassic period) finding karyotypic similarity to the chicken. We then took the work further to determine the likely karyotype of the bird-lizard ancestor and the chromosomal changes (chiefly translocations and inversions) that occurred between then and modern birds. A combination of bioinformatics and cross-species fluorescence in situ hybridization (zoo-FISH) uncovered a considerable number of translocations and fissions from a 'lizard-like' genome structure of 2n = 36-46 to one similar to that of soft-shelled turtles (2n = 66) from 275 to 255 million years ago (mya). Remarkable karyotypic similarities between some soft-shelled turtles and chicken suggests that there were few translocations from the bird-turtle ancestor (plus ∼7 fissions) through the dawn of the dinosaurs and pterosaurs, through the theropod linage and on to most to modern birds. In other words, an avian-like karyotype was in place about 240mya when the dinosaurs and pterosaurs first emerged. We mapped 49 chromosome inversions from then to the present day, uncovering some gene ontology enrichment in evolutionary breakpoint regions. This avian-like karyotype with its many (micro)chromosomes provides the basis for variation (the driver of natural selection) through increased random segregation and recombination. It may therefore contribute to the ability of dinosaurs to survive multiple extinction events, emerging each time as speciose and diverse.",

We used Rosetta to design 48 proteins containing active sites predicted to carry out this mechanism, of which two show catalytic activity by mass spectrometry (MS). Substrate labeling measured by MS and site-directed mutagenesis experiments show that the designed active-site residues are responsible for activity, although rate acceleration over background is modest. To characterize the designed proteins, we developed a fluorescence-based screen for intermediate formation in cell lysates, carried out microsecond molecular dynamics simulations, and solved X-ray crystal structures. These data indicate a partially formed active site and suggest several clear avenues for designing more active catalysts.",

MHealth apps may support adoption of self-management behaviors to assist people in symptoms control and quality of life enhancement. However, mHealth apps' designs, features, and content are inconsistently reported, making it difficult to determine which were the effective components. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the characteristics and features of published mHealth apps for chronic lung diseases. A structured search strategy across five databases (CINAHL, Medline, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane) was performed. Randomized controlled trials investigating interactive mHealth apps in adults with chronic lung disease were included. Screening and full-text reviews were completed by three reviewers using Research Screener and Covidence. Data extraction followed the mHealth Index and Navigation Database (MIND) Evaluation Framework (https://mindapps.org/), a tool designed to help clinicians determine the best mHealth apps to address patients' needs. Over 90,000 articles were screened, with 16 papers included. Fifteen distinct apps were identified, 8 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (53%) and 7 for asthma (46%) self-management. Different resources informed app design approaches, accompanied with varying qualities and features across studies. Common reported features included symptom tracking, medication reminders, education, and clinical support. There was insufficient information to answer MIND questions regarding security and privacy, and only five apps had additional publications to support their clinical foundation. Current studies reported designs and features of self-management apps differently. These app design variations create challenges in determining their effectiveness and suitability for chronic lung disease self-management. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42021260205).",

Here we describe the computational design of mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles with rigid structures that feature internal cyclic symmetries or improper rotational symmetries inaccessible to natural proteins. Crystal structures of three C2- and C3-symmetric macrocycles, and of six diverse S2-symmetric macrocycles, match the computationally-designed models with backbone heavy-atom RMSD values of 1 Å or better. Crystal structures of an S4-symmetric macrocycle (consisting of a sequence and structure segment mirrored at each of three successive repeats) designed to bind zinc reveal a large-scale zinc-driven conformational change from an S4-symmetric apo-state to a nearly inverted S4-symmetric holo-state almost identical to the design model. These symmetric structures provide promising starting points for applications ranging from design of cyclic peptide based metal organic frameworks to creation of high affinity binders of symmetric protein homo-oligomers. More generally, this work demonstrates the power of computational design for exploring symmetries and structures not found in nature, and for creating synthetic switchable systems.",

        "abstract": "nce Designed protein assemblies have many applications in medicine and technology. A long-standing design paradigm generates assemblies through genetic fusion of homo-oligomers via α-helical linkers. Here, we introduce a rigid fusion strategy that finds a greater number of design solutions and reduces formation of unintended assembly states, and a method for doubly anchoring target binding domains in the resulting assemblies that could contribute to cryogenic electron microscopy structure determination of small proteins. Protein nanomaterial design is an emerging discipline with applications in medicine and beyond. A long-standing design approach uses genetic fusion to join protein homo-oligomer subunits via α-helical linkers to form more complex symmetric assemblies, but this method is hampered by linker flexibility and a dearth of geometric solutions. Here, we describe a general computational method for rigidly fusing homo-oligomer and spacer building blocks to generate user-defined architectures that generates far more geometric solutions than previous approaches. The fusion junctions are then optimized using Rosetta to minimize flexibility. We apply this method to design and test 92 dihedral symmetric protein assemblies using a set of designed homodimers and repeat protein building blocks. Experimental validation by native mass spectrometry, small-angle X-ray scattering, and negative-stain single-particle electron microscopy confirms the assembly states for 11 designs. Most of these assemblies are constructed from designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), held in place on one end by α-helical fusion and on the other by a designed homodimer interface, and we explored their use for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure determination by incorporating DARPin variants selected to bind targets of interest. Although the target resolution was limited by preferred orientation effects and small scaffold size, we found that the dual anchoring strategy reduced the flexibility of the target-DARPIN complex with respect to the overall assembly, suggesting that multipoint anchoring of binding domains could contribute to cryo-EM structure determination of small proteins.",

Building on work in computer vision and natural language processing, we developed an approach based on deep learning - Scrambler networks - wherein the most salient sequence positions are identified with learned input masks. Scramblers learn to predict Position-Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs) where unimportant nucleotides or residues are scrambled by raising their entropy. We apply Scramblers to interpret the effects of genetic variants, uncover non-linear interactions between cis-regulatory elements, explain binding specificity for protein-protein interactions, and identify structural determinants of de novo designed proteins. We show that Scramblers enable efficient attribution across large datasets and result in high-quality explanations, often outperforming state-of-the-art methods.",

Disrupting YAP-TEAD interaction is an attractive strategy for cancer therapy. Targeting TEADs using small molecules that either bind to the YAP-binding pocket or the palmitate-binding pocket is proposed to disrupt the YAP-TEAD interaction. There is a need for methodologies to facilitate robust and reliable identification of compounds that occupy either YAP-binding pocket or palmitate-binding pocket. Here, using NMR spectroscopy, we validated compounds that bind to these pockets and also identify the residues in mouse TEAD4 (mTEAD4) that interact with these compounds. Flufenamic acid (FA) was used as a positive control for validation of palmitate-binding pocket-occupying compounds by NMR. Furthermore, we identify a hit from a fragment screen and show that it occupies a site close to YAP-binding pocket on the TEAD surface. Our results also indicate that purified mTEAD4 can catalyze autopalmitoylation. NMR studies on mTEAD4 revealed that exchanges exist in TEAD as NMR signal broadening was observed for residues close to the palmitoylation site. Mutating the palmitoylated cysteine (C360S mutant) abolished palmitoylation, while no significant changes in the NMR spectrum were observed for the mutant which still binds to YAP. We also show that FA inhibits TEAD autopalmitoylation. Our studies highlight the utility of NMR spectroscopy in identifying small molecules that bind to TEAD pockets and reinforce the notion that both palmitate-binding pocket and YAP-binding pocket are targetable.",

        "title": "WHY WAS AGRICULTURE SO IMPORTANT?",
        "abstract": "Walking through a garden or a crop field, you may notice that plants damaged by pests (insects or pathogens) look smaller than the same kind of plants nearby that are not damaged. An obvious explanation would be that damaged plants may have lost substantial photosynthetic tissue due to insect and pathogen activities. As such, plants may have a reduced ability to capture light and perform photosynthesis, which fuels the growth of plants. While this is likely part of the reason why damaged plants look smaller, there is also another and perhaps more fascinating explanation that we would like to discuss here in this primer. It turns out that plants attacked by insects, pathogens and other biotic stressors may 'purposely' slow down their growth and that this response is often systemic, meaning that it occurs throughout the plant and beyond the tissue that is damaged by pests. Interestingly, some chemicals or plant genetic mutations that simulate insect or pathogen attacks without causing a loss of photosynthetic tissue can also slow plant growth, suggesting the physical loss of photosynthetic tissue per se is not always a prerequisite for slowing down plant growth. In contrast, there are conditions under which plants need to grow rapidly. For example, plants grow quickly when searching for light during germination or under a shaded canopy due to crowding from neighboring plants. Under these conditions, rapid plant growth is often accompanied by increased susceptibility to pests, presumably because growth is prioritized over defense. This inverse growth-defense relationship is commonly known as the 'growth-defense trade-off' and may be considered one of the most fundamental principles of 'plant economics' that allows plants to adjust growth and defense based on external conditions (Figure 1). As plants must both grow and defend in order to reproduce and survive in the natural world, growth-defense trade-offs have important ecological consequences. In agricultural settings, crops have often been bred to maximize growth-related traits, which could inadvertently result in the loss of useful genetic traits for biotic defenses. Thus, deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying growth-defense trade-off phenomena could impact future crop breeding strategies aimed at designing superior crop plants with high yields as well as the ability to defend against biotic stressors. Here, we discuss some of the prevailing hypotheses about growth-defense trade-offs, our current understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and the ongoing efforts to optimize growth-defense trade-offs in crop plants.",

        "title": "HOW DID OUR HUMAN ANCESTORS EVOLVE?",
        "abstract": "Our understanding of human evolution has improved rapidly over recent decades, facilitated by large-scale cataloguing of genomic variability amongst both modern and archaic humans. It seems clear that the evolution of the ancestors of chimpanzees and hominins separated 7-9 million years ago with some migration out of Africa by the earlier hominins; Homo sapiens slowly emerged as climate change resulted in drier, less forested African conditions. The African populations expanded and evolved in many different conditions with slow mutation and selection rates in the human genome, but with much more rapid mutation occurring in mitochondrial DNA. We now have evidence stretching back 300 000 years of humans in their current form, but there are clearly four very different large African language groups that correlate with population DNA differences. Then, about 50 000-100 000 years ago a small subset of modern humans also migrated out of Africa resulting in a persistent signature of more limited genetic diversity amongst non-African populations. Hybridization with archaic hominins occurred around this time such that all non-African modern humans possess some Neanderthal ancestry and Melanesian populations additionally possess some Denisovan ancestry. Human populations both within and outside Africa also adapted to diverse aspects of their local environment including altitude, climate, UV exposure, diet and pathogens, in some cases leaving clear signatures of patterns of genetic variation. Notable examples include haemoglobin changes conferring resistance to malaria, other immune changes and the skin adaptations favouring the synthesis of vitamin D. As humans migrated across Eurasia, further major mitochondrial changes occurred with some interbreeding with ancient hominins and the development of alcohol intolerance. More recently, an ability to retain lactase persistence into adulthood has evolved rapidly under the environmental stimulus of pastoralism with the ability to husband lactating ruminants. Increased amylase copy numbers seem to relate to the availability of starchy foods, whereas the capacity to desaturase and elongate monounsaturated fatty acids in different societies seems to be influenced by whether there is a lack of supply of readily available dietary sources of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The process of human evolution includes genetic drift and adaptation to local environments, in part through changes in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. These genetic changes may underlie susceptibilities to some modern human pathologies including folate-responsive neural tube defects, diabetes, other age-related pathologies and mental health disorders.",

Tony was born at 30 weeks' gestational age by vaginal delivery with a birth weight of 4lbs 15oz and was described as minimally responsive at birth. There was known prenatal exposure to tobacco and methamphetamine and inadequate prenatal care. The maternal history is notable for a reported diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder, prostitution, and being unhoused at the time of delivery. Tony received antibiotics after delivery for presumed newborn infections. As an infant, he had kidney reflux, low serum ferritin, insomnia, and failure to thrive. Regarding developmental milestones, Tony was sitting up at 7 months, walking at 14 months, talking at 18 months, and speaking in full sentences by 24 months. When he presented to the psychiatric service at age 3 years, behavioral problems included irritability with destructive rages, excessive fears, separation anxiety, hyperactivity, and impulsivity with a lack of awareness of danger to the extent that he required a safety harness when in public and security locks in the home because of repeated elopements. Tony also had at the time of his initial presentation significant defiance, extreme tantrums, violent aggressive outbursts, cognitive rigidity, repetitive behaviors, resistance to change, frequent nondirected vocalizations, and self-injurious behaviors including slapping himself on the head and biting of his hands and feet. Review of systems includes complaints of frequent abdominal and neck pain, persistent insomnia, night terrors, restrictive eating habits with poor weight gain, and reduced sensitivity to pain. Treatment history included gabapentin and subsequently divalproex for seizure-like episodes (despite negative EEG) described as frequent staring spells with repetitive biting of his lips. Psychotropic medications were risperidone for irritability associated with autism and clonidine extended release for ADHD. He also took melatonin for sleep. During his well-child check at the age of 5 years, Tony is making good progress from a developmental standpoint, has age-appropriate expressive and receptive language skills, is fluent in both English and Spanish, is able to recite the alphabet, counts to 20, has learned to swim, and is demonstrating interest in planets and astrology. He is reported to have a secure attachment to his adoptive parents and is described as emotionally sensitive, caring, kind, considerate, and empathetic. He has good eye contact and can read facial expressions. He is affectionate and protective of his infant sibling, his biological sister, who is also adopted by his parents and now living in the home. Tony made an excellent adjustment to the start of kindergarten and up until this point was responding positively to his psychotropic medication regimen. But then at age five and a half, Tony experienced sudden and unexplained behavioral worsening, which was followed by the onset of recurrent vomiting and refusal to eat or drink. Comprehensive medical workup including upper endoscopy and biopsy resulted in a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). What would be your next step?",

There are approximately 4 million cases and 143,000 deaths each year due to cholera. The disease is transmitted fecally-orally via contaminated food or water. Severe dehydrating cholera can progress to hypovolemic shock due to the rapid loss of fluids and electrolytes, which requires a rapid infusion of intravenous (i.v.) fluids. The case fatality rate exceeds 50% without proper clinical management but can be less than 1% with prompt rehydration and antibiotics. Oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) serve as a major component of an integrated control package during outbreaks or within zones of endemicity. Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH); health education; and prophylactic antibiotic treatment are additional components of the prevention and control of cholera. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Task Force for Cholera Control (GTFCC) have set an ambitious goal of eliminating cholera by 2030 in high-risk areas.",

However, our knowledge is still missing with regard to what additional driver events take place in what order, before one or more of these clones in normal tissues ultimately evolve to cancer. Here, using phylogenetic analyses of multiple microdissected samples from both cancer and non-cancer lesions, we show unique evolutionary histories of breast cancers harbouring der(1;16), a common driver alteration found in roughly 20% of breast cancers. The approximate timing of early evolutionary events was estimated from the mutation rate measured in normal epithelial cells. In der(1;16)(+) cancers, the derivative chromosome was acquired from early puberty to late adolescence, followed by the emergence of a common ancestor by the patient's early 30s, from which both cancer and non-cancer clones evolved. Replacing the pre-existing mammary epithelium in the following years, these clones occupied a large area within the premenopausal breast tissues by the time of cancer diagnosis. Evolution of multiple independent cancer founders from the non-cancer ancestors was common, contributing to intratumour heterogeneity. The number of driver events did not correlate with histology, suggesting the role of local microenvironments and/or epigenetic driver events. A similar evolutionary pattern was also observed in another case evolving from an AKT1-mutated founder. Taken together, our findings provide new insight into how breast cancer evolves.",

Structure-based computational design could help to identify amino acid mutations leading to improved catalytic activity and enantioselectivity. Here we describe the application of Rosetta Design for the genetic optimization of an artificial transfer hydrogenase (ATHase hereafter), [(η(5)-Cp*)Ir(pico)Cl] ⊂ WT hCA II (Cp* = Me5C5(-)), for the asymmetric reduction of a cyclic imine, the precursor of salsolsidine. Based on a crystal structure of the ATHase, computational design afforded four hCAII variants with protein backbone-stabilizing and hydrophobic cofactor-embedding mutations. In dansylamide-competition assays, these designs showed 46-64-fold improved affinity for the iridium pianostool complex [(η(5)-Cp*)Ir(pico)Cl]. Gratifyingly, the new designs yielded a significant improvement in both activity and enantioselectivity (from 70% ee (WT hCA II) to up to 92% ee and a 4-fold increase in total turnover number) for the production of (S)-salsolidine. Introducing additional hydrophobicity in the Cp*-moiety of the Ir-catalyst provided by adding a propyl substituent on the Cp* moiety yields the most (S)-selective (96% ee) ATHase reported to date. X-ray structural data indicate that the high enantioselectivity results from embedding the piano stool moiety within the protein, consistent with the computational model.",

Advances in gene editing - in particular conditional genetic approaches and mass spectrometry have paved the way for characterisation of the key components of the cAMP signalling pathway in malaria parasites. This has revealed that cAMP signalling plays a critical role in invasion of host red blood cells by Plasmodium falciparum merozoites through regulating the phosphorylation of key parasite proteins by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).

Achievement of this goal requires the development of new tools including novel antimalarial drugs and more efficacious vaccines as well as an increased understanding of the disease and biology of the parasite.

How to articulate the peculiarity of life? Researchers in the seventeenth century proposed both \"animist\" and mechanistic theories of life. In the eighteenth century again a controversy in biology arose regarding the explanation of generation. Some adhered to the view that life is a physical property of matter (e.g. Buffon), others saw living entities as the result of the development of pre-existing germs (e.g. Bonnet). Naturalists, lacked a convincing account that could guide their research. In interaction with leading naturalists of his time Immanuel Kant articulated an approach to explaining generation. Kant's account, delineated in his Kritik der Urteilskraft (Critique of the power of judgment) (1790), is a combination of Newtonian non-reductionist mechanism in explanation, and a concept of natural end comparable to Stahl's formal conception of organic bodies. It consists of two claims: a) in biology only mechanical explanation is explanatory, and b) living entities contain some original organisation, which is mechanically unexplainable. In the nineteenth century this approach influenced naturalists as Müller, Virchow, and Von Baer, in their physiological research. Dissatisfied with a sheer mechanistic or, on the other hand, a sheer teleological approach, they appreciated the Kantian account of mechanical explanation of natural ends. In Germany, in the second halve of the nineteenth century, Ernst Haeckel reopened the debate about abiogenesis, which still continuous.",

For example, class I viral fusion proteins undergo large scale conformational changes from a pre-fusion to a post-fusion structure critical for the virus to enter cells(Ivanovic et al., 2013; Podbilewicz, 2014; Skehel and Wiley, 2000). While computational methods have been used to de novo design proteins in single deep free energy minima(Huang et al., 2016), designing sequences with two well-separated free energy minima corresponding to well-defined, but divergent structures is substantially more challenging, and has not yet been achieved. Here, we design sequences which can adopt two very different homotrimeric helical bundle conformations -- one short (~66 Å height) and the other long (~100 Å height) -- reminiscent of the conformational transition of viral fusion proteins. Crystallographic and NMR spectroscopic characterization of a set of closely related sequences show that both the short and long structures fold as designed, and suggest that the two states are nearly isoenergetic as small sequence changes and/or changes in measurement conditions switch the observed state.",

It results from the accumulation of the misfolded protein transthyretin within the myocardium, resulting in amyloid transthyretin-associated cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). Over 150 different pathologic point mutations within the transthyretin gene have been identified, each carrying variable clinical phenotypes and penetrance. In the USA, the most common cause of hereditary ATTR is the Val122Ile point mutation, with a prevalence of 3.4-4.0% in North Americans of African and Caribbean descent. Among Caucasians with hereditary ATTR-CM, the V30M mutation is the most commonly identified variant. Overall, the incidence of ATTR disease in the USA has been increasing, likely due to an increase in practitioner awareness, utilization of new non-invasive imaging technologies for ATTR diagnosis, and the growth of multidisciplinary amyloid programs across the country. Yet significant numbers of patients with evidence of left ventricular thickening on cardiac imaging, senile aortic stenosis, and/or symptoms of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction likely have undiagnosed CA, especially within the African American population. With the emergence of new disease-modifying therapies for ATTR, recognition and the prompt diagnosis of CA is important for patients and their potentially affected progeny.

Key features of this strategy (CASCO, catalytic selectivity by computational design) are the design of mutations that favor binding of the substrate in a predefined orientation, the introduction of steric hindrance to prevent unwanted substrate binding modes, and ranking of designs by high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations. Using this strategy we obtained highly stereoselective mutants of limonene epoxide hydrolase after experimental screening of only 37 variants.

We used computational protein design to generate protein models with binding sites for 17-OHP containing an extended, nonpolar, shape-complementary binding pocket for the four-ring core of the compound, and hydrogen bonding residues at the base of the pocket to interact with carbonyl and hydroxyl groups at the more polar end of the ligand. Eight of 16 designed proteins experimentally tested bind 17-OHP with micromolar affinity. A co-crystal structure of one of the designs revealed that 17-OHP is rotated 180° around a pseudo-two-fold axis in the compound and displays multiple binding modes within the pocket, while still interacting with all of the designed residues in the engineered site. Subsequent rounds of mutagenesis and binding selection improved the ligand affinity to nanomolar range, while appearing to constrain the ligand to a single bound conformation that maintains the same \"flipped\" orientation relative to the original design. We trace the discrepancy in the design calculations to two sources: first, a failure to model subtle backbone changes which alter the distribution of sidechain rotameric states and second, an underestimation of the energetic cost of desolvating the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups of the ligand. The difference between design model and crystal structure thus arises from both sampling limitations and energy function inaccuracies that are exacerbated by the near two-fold symmetry of the molecule.",

Here, we demonstrate that computational design of a library with chemically diverse stabilizing mutations allows the engineering of drastically stabilized and fully functional variants of the mesostable enzyme limonene epoxide hydrolase. First, point mutations were selected if they significantly improved the predicted free energy of protein folding. Disulfide bonds were designed using sampling of backbone conformational space, which tripled the number of experimentally stabilizing disulfide bridges. Next, orthogonal in silico screening steps were used to remove chemically unreasonable mutations and mutations that are predicted to increase protein flexibility. The resulting library of 64 variants was experimentally screened, which revealed 21 (pairs of) stabilizing mutations located both in relatively rigid and in flexible areas of the enzyme. Finally, combining 10-12 of these confirmed mutations resulted in multi-site mutants with an increase in apparent melting temperature from 50 to 85°C, enhanced catalytic activity, preserved regioselectivity and a >250-fold longer half-life.

With the emerging recognition of world population feeding, global climate change and limited energy resources with fossil fuels, the relevance of plant biology and biotechnology is becoming dramatically important. One key issue is to improve plant productivity and abiotic/biotic stress resistance in agriculture due to restricted land area and increasing environmental pressures. Another aspect is the development of CO(2)-neutral plant resources for fiber/biomass and biofuels: a transition from first generation plants like sugar cane, maize and other important nutritional crops to second and third generation energy crops such as Miscanthus and trees for lignocellulose and algae for biomass and feed, hydrogen and lipid production. At the same time we have to conserve and protect natural diversity and species richness as a foundation of our life on earth. Here, biodiversity banks are discussed as a foundation of current and future plant breeding research. Consequently, it can be anticipated that plant biology and ecology will have more indispensable future roles in all socio-economic aspects of our life than ever before. We therefore need an in-depth understanding of the physiology of single plant species for practical applications as well as the translation of this knowledge into complex natural as well as anthropogenic ecosystems. Latest developments in biological and bioanalytical research will lead into a paradigm shift towards trying to understand organisms at a systems level and in their ecosystemic context: (i) shotgun and next-generation genome sequencing, gene reconstruction and annotation, (ii) genome-scale molecular analysis using OMICS technologies and (iii) computer-assisted analysis, modeling and interpretation of biological data. Systems biology combines these molecular data, genetic evolution, environmental cues and species interaction with the understanding, modeling and prediction of active biochemical networks up to whole species populations. This process relies on the development of new technologies for the analysis of molecular data, especially genomics, metabolomics and proteomics data. The ambitious aim of these non-targeted 'omic' technologies is to extend our understanding beyond the analysis of separated parts of the system, in contrast to traditional reductionistic hypothesis-driven approaches. The consequent integration of genotyping, pheno/morphotyping and the analysis of the molecular phenotype using metabolomics, proteomics and transcriptomics will reveal a novel understanding of plant metabolism and its interaction with the environment. The analysis of single model systems - plants, fungi, animals and bacteria - will finally emerge in the analysis of populations of plants and other organisms and their adaptation to the ecological niche. In parallel, this novel understanding of ecophysiology will translate into knowledge-based approaches in crop plant biotechnology and marker- or genome-assisted breeding approaches. In this review the foundations of green systems biology are described and applications in ecosystems research are presented. Knowledge exchange of ecosystems research and green biotechnology merging into green systems biology is anticipated based on the principles of natural variation, biodiversity and the genotype-phenotype environment relationship as the fundamental drivers of ecology and evolution.",

Here we investigate an alternative active-site design in which the catalytic water molecule was replaced by the side chain of a glutamic acid. Five out of seven designs expressed solubly and exhibited catalytic efficiencies similar to previously designed retroaldolases for the conversion of 4-hydroxy-4-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)-2-butanone to 6-methoxy-2-naphthaldehyde and acetone. After one round of site-directed saturation mutagenesis, improved variants of the two best designs, RA114 and RA117, exhibited among the highest kcat (>10(-3)s(-1)) and kcat/KM (11-25M(-1)s(-1)) values observed for retroaldolase designs prior to comprehensive directed evolution.

The catalytic sites, revealed by X-ray structures of optimized versions of the two active designs, are in close agreement with the design models except for the catalytic lysine in RA114.

In a few cases, computer simulations of the physical forces in chemically detailed models have now achieved the accurate folding of small proteins. We have learned that proteins fold rapidly because random thermal motions cause conformational changes leading energetically downhill toward the native structure, a principle that is captured in funnel-shaped energy landscapes. And thanks in part to the large Protein Data Bank of known structures, predicting protein structures is now far more successful than was thought possible in the early days.

In a step toward custom design of enzyme catalysts, they used these principles to control β-sheet geometry and design proteins with differently shaped cavities. Science, this issue p. 201 Understanding the principles that control β-sheet geometry allows design of proteins with cavities. Active sites and ligand-binding cavities in native proteins are often formed by curved β sheets, and the ability to control β-sheet curvature would allow design of binding proteins with cavities customized to specific ligands. Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling β-sheet curvature by studying the geometry of β sheets in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations. The principles emerging from this analysis were used to design, de novo, a series of proteins with curved β sheets topped with α helices. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the designs closely match the computational models, showing that β-sheet curvature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy. Our approach enables the design of proteins with cavities and provides a route to custom design ligand-binding and catalytic sites.",

Here, we provide an overview of machine learning applications for the analysis of genome sequencing data sets, including the annotation of sequence elements and epigenetic, proteomic or metabolomic data. We present considerations and recurrent challenges in the application of supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, as well as of generative and discriminative modelling approaches. We provide general guidelines to assist in the selection of these machine learning methods and their practical application for the analysis of genetic and genomic data sets.",

        "abstract": "sed tags attached to a protein-of-interest (POI) that react with a small molecule, rendering the conjugate fluorescent, are very useful for studying the POI in living cells. These tags are typically based on endogenous enzymes, so protein engineering is required to ensure that the small-molecule probe does not react with the endogenous enzyme in the cell of interest. Here we demonstrate that de novo-designed enzymes can be used as tags to attach to POIs. The inherent bioorthogonality of the de novo-designed enzyme–small-molecule probe reaction circumvents the need for protein engineering, since these enzyme activities are not present in living organisms. Herein, we transform a family of de novo-designed retroaldolases into variable-molecular-weight tags exhibiting fluorescence imaging, reporter, and electrophoresis applications that are regulated by tailored, reactive small-molecule fluorophores.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive change affecting patients after anaesthesia and surgery has been recognised for more than 100 yr. Research into cognitive change after anaesthesia and surgery accelerated in the 1980s when multiple studies utilised detailed neuropsychological testing for assessment of cognitive change after cardiac surgery. This body of work consistently documented decline in cognitive function in elderly patients after anaesthesia and surgery, and cognitive changes have been identified up to 7.5 yr afterwards. Importantly, other studies have identified that the incidence of cognitive change is similar after non-cardiac surgery. Other than the inclusion of non-surgical control groups to calculate postoperative cognitive dysfunction, research into these cognitive changes in the perioperative period has been undertaken in isolation from cognitive studies in the general population. The aim of this work is to develop similar terminology to that used in cognitive classifications of the general population for use in investigations of cognitive changes after anaesthesia and surgery. A multispecialty working group followed a modified Delphi procedure with no prespecified number of rounds comprised of three face-to-face meetings followed by online editing of draft versions. Two major classification guidelines [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) and National Institute for Aging and the Alzheimer Association (NIA-AA)] are used outside of anaesthesia and surgery, and may be useful for inclusion of biomarkers in research. For clinical purposes, it is recommended to use the DSM-5 nomenclature. The working group recommends that 'perioperative neurocognitive disorders' be used as an overarching term for cognitive impairment identified in the preoperative or postoperative period. This includes cognitive decline diagnosed before operation (described as neurocognitive disorder); any form of acute event (postoperative delirium) and cognitive decline diagnosed up to 30 days after the procedure (delayed neurocognitive recovery) and up to 12 months (postoperative neurocognitive disorder).",

        "title": "Identification of a New Site of Sumoylation",
        "abstract": "The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) plays important roles, with the SUMOylation pathway as one of its core components. In the present work, a single SUMO gene was initially identified from Taenia pisiformis and designated as TpSUMO. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the TpSUMO gene contained a 309 bp open reading frame (ORF), encoding 102 amino acids, and had a predicted molecular weight of ∼12 kDa. The amino acid sequence of TpSUMO was deduced and it shared 44.00% identity with human SUMO2 (HsSUMO2) and exhibited more than 97.78% identity with SUMOs from Taenia and Echinococcus. TpSUMO possessed a putative non-consensus site (FK11MG) within its N-terminus and a typical di-glycine (GG) motif at the C-terminus. Basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) analysis showed that only a single SUMO-related ortholog was present in each set of known genome data for fourteen tapeworm species. The precursor His-TpSUMO-FL, mature His-TpSUMO-GG and mutant His-TpSUMO-GGK11R proteins (∼18 kDa) were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosseta (DE3), and rabbit polyclonal anti-TpSUMO was generated with a high titer of 1.28 × 105. In vitro SUMOylation assay results showed that TpSUMO multimer formation in the His-TpSUMO-GG reaction could be catalyzed by the human SAE1/SAE2 and UBC9 conjugation system, but K11R mutation disrupted TpSUMO chain synthesis. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) further revealed that TpSUMO was ubiquitously expressed in different stages of T. pisiformis and in higher levels during an early development phase (day 14) of adult worms. Immunofluorescence localization showed that TpSUMO was detected in the bladder wall of cysticerci, in the testis in immature segment, and within eggs in the gravid proglottids. These findings indicated that TpSUMO is a new member of the SUMO protein family and may play a vital role in regulation of functions within proteins involved in worm growth and development.",

        "abstract": "se of this study was to evaluate the effect of gap width on bone healing around implants placed into simulated extraction socket defects of varying widths in 10 mongrel dogs. All premolars were removed and the alveolar ridges were reduced to a width of 7 mm. Nine weeks later, a total of 80 implants, 10 mm long by 3.3 mm wide, were placed into osteotomy sites prepared to 3 different diameters in the coronal half, simulating extraction sockets. Three experimental sites, with gap sizes of 0.5 mm, 1.0 mm, and 1.4 mm, were created; the control sites had no gap. The depth of each defect was measured at the time of implant placement. All implants were stable at the time of placement. The dogs were euthanized 12 weeks after implant placement, and blocks containing the implants and adjacent bone were submitted for histologic evaluation. Clinically, all control and test sites healed, with complete bone fill in the defect. Percentages of bone-to-implant contact were measured histologically. As the gap widened, the amount of bone-to-implant contact decreased, and the point of the highest bone-to-implant contact shifted apically. These changes were statistically significant (P < .001). No statistically significant differences in bone-to-implant contact were found between the sites when the apical 4 mm of implants were compared. Within the limits of this study, the simulated extraction socket defects healed clinically, with complete bone fill, regardless of the initial gap size. However, the width of the gap at the time of implant placement had a significant impact on the histologic percentage and the height of bone-to-implant contact.",

For decades, such mapping has been principally approached with microscopy techniques, aiming to visualize neurons and their connections.

We recently leveraged the speed and parallelization of DNA sequencing to map the projections of thousands of single neurons in single experiments, and to map cortical mesoscale connectivity in single mice. Here, I review the state of sequencing-based neuroanatomy, and discuss future directions in synaptic connectivity mapping and comparative connectomics.",

        "title": "A Geometric Filter for Unbound Protein-Protein Docking",
        "abstract": "A successful protein-protein docking study culminates in identification of decoys at top ranks with near-native quaternary structures. However, this task remains enigmatic because no generalized scoring functions exist that effectively infer decoys according to the similarity to near-native quaternary structures. Difficulties arise because of the highly irregular nature of the protein surface and the significant variation of the nonbonding and solvation energies based on the chemical composition of the protein-protein interface. In this work, we describe a novel method combining an interface-size filter, a regression model for geometric compatibility (based on two correlated surface and packing parameters), and normalized interaction energy (calculated from correlated nonbonded and solvation energies), to effectively rank decoys from a set of 10,000 decoys. Tests on 30 unbound binary protein-protein complexes show that in 16 cases we can identify at least one decoy in top three ranks having ≤10 Å backbone root mean square deviation from true binding geometry. Comparisons with other state-of-art methods confirm the improved ranking power of our method without the use of any experiment-guided restraints, evolutionary information, statistical propensities, or modified interaction energy equations. Tests on 118 less-difficult bound binary protein-protein complexes with ≤35% sequence redundancy at the interface showed that in 77% cases, at least 1 in 10,000 decoys were identified with ≤5Å backbone root mean square deviation from true geometry at first rank. The work will promote the use of new concepts where correlations among parameters provide more robust scoring models. It will facilitate studies involving molecular interactions, including modeling of large macromolecular assemblies and protein structure prediction.",

Understanding the expression patterns of individual genes is the initial step toward this goal. In this report, we have examined gene expression during gametocytogenesis of the malaria parasite, P. falciparum, using a modified differential display (DD) method. The modifications of this method include adjusting the dNTP mix, using upstream primers with higher AT contents, and reducing the extension temperature of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). With a combination of 16 arbitrary upstream primers and 3 one-base-anchored oligo(dT) primers, we have successfully cloned 80 unique cDNA tags from stage IV-V gametocytes. Further analysis by dot blots and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR showed that at least 49 cDNAs had induced or elevated levels of expression in gametocytes. These results indicate that this modified DD procedure is suitable for large-scale identification of developmentally regulated genes in the AT-rich Plasmodium genome.",

We predict protein domain boundaries and three-dimensional (3D) structures for protein domains from 94 genomes (including human, Arabidopsis, rice, mouse, fly, yeast, Escherichia coli, and worm). De novo structure predictions were distributed on a grid of more than 1.5 million CPUs worldwide (World Community Grid). We generated significant numbers of new confident fold annotations (9% of domains that are otherwise unannotated in these genomes). We demonstrate that predicted structures can be combined with annotations from the Gene Ontology database to predict new and more specific molecular functions.",
