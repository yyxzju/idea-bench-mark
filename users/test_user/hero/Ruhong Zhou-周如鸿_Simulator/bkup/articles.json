      "title": "Destructive extraction of phospholipids from Escherichia coli membranes by graphene nanosheets",
      "authors": "Yusong Tu, Min Lv, Peng Xiu, Tien Huynh, Meng Zhang, Matteo Castelli, Zengrong Liu, Qing Huang, Chunhai Fan, Haiping Fang, Ruhong Zhou",
      "summary": "Understanding how nanomaterials interact with cell membranes is critical for designing safer biomedical applications. This study shows that pristine graphene and graphene oxide nanosheets can induce the degradation of the inner and outer cell membranes of Escherichia coli, reducing their viability.",
      "conclusion": "Graphene nanosheets can penetrate into and extract large amounts of phospholipids from cell membranes.",

      "summary": "This study investigates the influence of patient-specific HLA-I genotype on response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. It was found that maximal heterozygosity at HLA-I loci improved overall survival compared to patients homozygous for at least one HLA locus.",
      "conclusion": "HLA-B44 supertype is associated with extended survival, while HLA-B62 is associated with poor outcome.",

      "summary": "The study explores the interaction of carbon nanotubes with human serum proteins and its implications for cytotoxicity. It reveals that protein binding to carbon nanotubes can significantly reduce their cytotoxicity.",
      "conclusion": "The π-π stacking interactions between carbon nanotubes and aromatic residues play a crucial role in determining adsorption capacity.",
