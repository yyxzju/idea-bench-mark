"The design and use of materials in the nanoscale size range for addressing medical and health-related issues continues to receive increasing interest. Research in nanomedicine spans a multitude of areas, including drug delivery, vaccine development, antibacterial, diagnosis and imaging tools, wearable devices, implants, high-throughput screening platforms, etc. using biological, nonbiological, biomimetic, or hybrid materials. Many of these developments are starting to be translated into viable clinical products. Here, we provide an overview of recent developments in nanomedicine and highlight the current challenges and upcoming opportunities for the field and translation to the clinic."
"ancer nanomedicines can only mitigate adverse effects but fail to enhance therapeutic efficacies of anticancer drugs. Rational design of next‐generation cancer nanomedicines should aim to enhance their therapeutic efficacies. Taking this into account, this review first analyzes the typical cancer‐drug‐delivery process of an intravenously administered nanomedicine and concludes that the delivery involves a five‐step CAPIR cascade and that high efficiency at every step is critical to guarantee high overall therapeutic efficiency. Further analysis shows that the nanoproperties needed in each step for a nanomedicine to maximize its efficiency are different and even opposing in different steps, particularly what the authors call the PEG, surface‐charge, size and stability dilemmas. To resolve those dilemmas in order to integrate all needed nanoproperties into one nanomedicine, stability, surface and size nanoproperty transitions (3S transitions for short) are proposed and the reported strategies to realize these transitions are comprehensively summarized. Examples of nanomedicines capable of the 3S transitions are discussed, as are future research directions to design high‐performance cancer nanomedicines and their clinical translations."
"e of ""task specific ionic liquid"", tetrabutylphosphonium amino acid [P(C4)4][AA], was synthesized by the reaction of tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide [P(C4)4][OH] with amino acids, including glycine, L-alanine, L-beta-alanine, L-serine, and L-lysine. The liquids produced were characterized by NMR, IR spectroscopies, and elemental analysis, and their thermal decomposition temperature, glass transition temperature, electrical conductivity, density, and viscosity were recorded in detail. The [P(C4)4][AA] supported on porous silica gel effected fast and reversible CO2 absorption when compared with bubbling CO2 into the bulk of the ionic liquid. No changes in absorption capacity and kinetics were found after four cycles of absorption/desorption. The CO2 absorption capacity at equilibrium was 50 mol % of the ionic liquids. In the presence of water (1 wt %), the ionic liquids could absorb equimolar amounts of CO2. The CO2 absorption mechanisms of the ionic liquids with and without water were different."
"The specific sizes that determine optimal nanoparticle tumor accumulation, penetration, and treatment remain inconclusive because many studies compared nanoparticles with multiple physicochemical variables (e.g., chemical structures, shapes, and other physical properties) in addition to the size. In this study, we synthesized amphiphilic block copolymers of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxylcamptothecin (SN38) prodrug and fabricated micelles with sizes ranging from 20 to 300 nm from a single copolymer. The as-prepared micelles had exactly the same chemical structures and similar physical properties except for size, which provided an ideal platform for a systematic investigation of the size effects in cancer drug delivery. We found that the micelle's blood circulation time and tumor accumulation increased with the increase in their diameters, with optimal diameter range of 100 to 160 nm. However, the much higher tumor accumulation of the large micelles (100 nm) did not result in significantly improved therapeutic efficacy, because the large micelles had poorer tumor penetration than the small ones (30 nm). An optimal size that balances drug accumulation and penetration in tumors is critical for improving the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticulate drugs."
"Anticancer drugs embedded in or conjugated with inert nanocarriers, referred to as nanomedicines, show many therapeutic advantages over free drugs, but the inert carrier materials are the major component (generally more than 90%) in nanomedicines, causing low drug loading contents and thus excessive uses of parenteral excipients. Herein, we demonstrate a new concept directly using drug molecules to fabricate nanocarriers in order to minimize use of inert materials, substantially increase the drug loading content, and suppress premature burst release. Taking advantage of the strong hydrophobicity of the anticancer drug camptothecin (CPT), one or two CPT molecule(s) were conjugated to a very short oligomer chain of ethylene glycol (OEG), forming amphiphilic phospholipid-mimicking prodrugs, OEG-CPT or OEG-DiCPT. The prodrugs formed stable liposome-like nanocapsules with a CPT loading content as high as 40 or 58 wt % with no burst release in aqueous solution. OEG-DiCPT released CPT once inside cells, which showed high in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity. Meanwhile, the resulting nanocapsules can be loaded with a water-soluble drug-doxorubicin salt (DOX.HCl)-with a high loading efficiency. The DOX.HCl-loaded nanocapsules simultaneously delivered two anticancer drugs, leading to a synergetic cytotoxicity to cancer cells. The concept directly using drugs as part of a carrier is applicable to fabricating other highly efficient nanocarriers with a substantially reduced use of inert carrier materials and increased drug loading content without premature burst release."
"A tumour microenvironment imposes barriers to the passive diffusion of molecules, which renders tumour penetration an unresolved obstacle to an effective anticancer drug delivery. Here, we present a γ-glutamyl transpeptidase-responsive camptothecin-polymer conjugate that actively infiltrates throughout the tumour tissue through transcytosis. When the conjugate passes on the luminal endothelial cells of the tumour blood vessels or extravasates into the tumour interstitium, the overexpressed γ-glutamyl transpeptidase on the cell membrane cleaves the γ-glutamyl moieties of the conjugate to generate positively charged primary amines. The resulting cationic conjugate undergoes caveolae-mediated endocytosis and transcytosis, which enables transendothelial and transcellular transport and a relatively uniform distribution throughout the tumour. The conjugate showed a potent antitumour activity in mouse models that led to the eradication of small solid tumours (~100 mm3) and regression of large established tumours with clinically relevant sizes (~500 mm3), and significantly extended the survival of orthotopic pancreatic tumour-bearing mice compared to that with the first-line chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine."

"onitoring of the biodistribution and activation of prodrugs is urgently required. Near infrared (NIR) fluorescence-active fluorophores with excellent photostability are preferable for tracking drug release in vivo. Herein, we describe a NIR prodrug DCM-S-CPT and its polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid (PEG-PLA) loaded nanoparticles as a potent cancer therapy. We have conjugated a dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran derivative as the NIR fluorophore with camptothecin (CPT) as the anticancer drug using a disulfide linker. In vitro experiments verify that the high intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations in tumor cells cause cleavage of the disulfide linker, resulting in concomitantly the active drug CPT release and significant NIR fluorescence turn-on with large Stokes shift (200 nm). The NIR fluorescence of DCM-S-CPT at 665 nm with fast response to GSH can act as a direct off-on signal reporter for the GSH-activatable prodrug. Particularly, DCM-S-CPT possesses much better photostability than ICG, which is highly desirable for in situ fluorescence-tracking of cancer chemotherapy. DCM-S-CPT has been successfully utilized for in vivo and in situ tracking of drug release and cancer therapeutic efficacy in living animals by NIR fluorescence. DCM-S-CPT exhibits excellent tumor-activatable performance when intravenously injected into tumor-bearing nude mice, as well as specific cancer therapy with few side effects. DCM-S-CPT loaded in PEG-PLA nanoparticles shows even higher antitumor activity than free CPT, and is also retained longer in the plasma. The tumor-targeting ability and the specific drug release in tumors make DCM-S-CPT as a promising prodrug, providing significant advances toward deeper understanding and exploration of theranostic drug-delivery systems."

"A prodrug forms nanocapsules responsive to tumor GSH/ROS heterogeneity releasing the parent drug SN38 via thiolysis in the presence of GSH (glutathione) or via enhanced hydrolysis due to ROS (reactive oxygen species)-oxidation of the linker, giving rise to high in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo anticancer therapeutic activity. The nanocapsules are a suitable size for tumor targeting by means of the EPR effect and have a fixed SN38 loading content of 35 wt%, ideal for translational nanomedicine."

"A ""cluster-bomb""-like lipid-dendrimer nanoassembly synergizes the functions of its components and thereby efficiently accomplishes the drug delivery cascade for high efficacy in treating cancer. The nanoassembly successfully circulates in the blood and accumulates in the tumor. Once in the tumor, it releases small dendrimers that act like ""bomblets"", enabling tumor penetration, cell internalization, and drug release."
"Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) such as transactivator of transcription (TAT) peptide have long been explored for promoting in vitro cell penetration and nuclear targeting of various cargos, but their positive charges cause strong nonspecific interactions, making them inapplicable for many in vivo applications. In this work, we used TAT to demonstrate a molecular modification approach for inhibiting nonspecific interactions of CPPs in the bloodstream while reactivating their functions in the targeted tissues or cells. The TAT lysine residues' amines were amidized to succinyl amides ((a)TAT), completely inhibiting TAT's nonspecific interactions in the blood compartment; once in the acidic tumor interstitium or internalized into cell endo/lysosomes, the succinyl amides in the (a)TAT were quickly hydrolyzed, fully restoring TAT's functions. Thus, (a)TAT-functionalized poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(ε-caprolactone) micelles achieved long circulation in the blood compartment and efficiently accumulated and delivered doxorubicin to tumor tissues, giving rise to high antitumor activity and low cardiotoxicity. This amidization strategy effectively and easily enables in vivo applications of CPPs."
"usogenic lipidic polyplex (FLPP) vector is designed to fuse with cell membranes, mimicking viropexis, and eject the polyplex into the cytosol, where the cationic polymer is subsequently oxidized by intracellular reactive oxygen species and converts to being negatively charged, efficiently releasing the DNA. The vector delivering suicide gene achieves significantly better inhibition of tumor growth than doxorubicin."
"of imidazolium-based ionic liquid monomers and their corresponding polymers (poly(ionic liquid)s) were synthesized, and their CO2 sorption was studied. The poly(ionic liquid)s had enhanced CO2 sorption capacities and fast sorption/desorption rates compared with room temperature ionic liquids. The effects of the chemical structures, including the types of anion, cation, and backbone of the poly(ionic liquid)s on their CO2 sorption have been discussed. In contrast to room temperature ionic liquids, the polymer with PF anions had the highest CO2-sorption capacity, while those with BF or Tf2N− anions had the same capacities. The CO2 sorption and desorption of the polymers were fast and reversible, and the sorption was selective over H2, N2, and O2. The measured Henry's constants of P[VBBI][BF4] and P[MABI][BF4] were 26.0 bar and 37.7 bar, which were lower than those of similar room temperature ionic liquids. The preliminary study of the mechanism indicated that the CO2 sorption of the polymer particles was more absorption (the bulk) but less adsorption (the surface). © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"In this study, some copper catalysts used for atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) were explored as efficient anti-tumor agents. The aqueous solution of copper-containing nanoparticles with uniform spheric morphology was in situ prepared through a copper-catalyzed activator generated by electron transfer (AGET) ATRP in water. Nanoparticles were then directly injected into tumor-bearing mice for antitumor chemotherapy. The copper nanodrugs had prolonged blood circulation time and enhanced accumulation at tumor sites, thus showing potent antitumor activity. This work provides a novel strategy for precise and large-scale preparation of copper nanodrugs with high antitumor activity."
"A cascade amplification release nanoparticle (CARN) is constructed by the coencapsulation of β-lapachone and a reactive-oxygen-species (ROS)-responsive doxorubicin (DOX) prodrug, BDOX, in polymeric nanoparticles. Releasing β-lapachone first from the CARNs selectively increases the ROS level in cancer cells via NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) catalysis, which induces the cascade amplification release of DOX and overcomes multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells, producing a remarkably improved therapeutic efficacy against MDR tumors with minimal side effects."

"ssure Carbon Filter Process (patent pending) is proposed to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from flue gas. This filter is filled with a low-cost carbonaceous sorbent, such as activated carbon or charcoal, which has a high affinity (and, hence, high capacity) to CO2 but not to nitrogen (N2). This, in turn, leads to a high CO2/N2 selectivity, especially at low pressures. The Carbon Filter Process proposed in this work can recover at least 90% of flue-gas CO2 of 90%+ purity at a fraction of the cost normally associated with the conventional amine absorption process. The Carbon Filter Process requires neither expensive materials nor flue-gas compression or refrigeration, and it is easy to heat integrate with an existing or grassroots power plant without affecting the cost of the produced electricity too much. An abundant supply of low-cost CO2 from electricity producers is good news for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and enhanced coal-bed methane recovery (ECBMR) operators, because it will lead to higher o..."
"Cancer remains a highly lethal disease in the world. Currently, either conventional cancer therapies or modern immunotherapies are non-tumor-targeted therapeutic approaches that cannot accurately distinguish malignant cells from healthy ones, giving rise to multiple undesired side effects. Recent advances in nanotechnology, accompanied by our growing understanding of cancer biology and nano-bio interactions, have led to the development of a series of nanocarriers, which aim to improve the therapeutic efficacy while reducing off-target toxicity of the encapsulated anticancer agents through tumor tissue-, cell-, or organelle-specific targeting. However, the vast majority of nanocarriers do not possess hierarchical targeting capability, and their therapeutic indices are often compromised by either poor tumor accumulation, inefficient cellular internalization, or inaccurate subcellular localization. This Review outlines current and prospective strategies in the design of tumor tissue-, cell-, and organelle-targeted cancer nanomedicines, and highlights the latest progress in hierarchical targeting technologies that can dynamically integrate these three different stages of static tumor targeting to maximize therapeutic outcomes. Finally, we briefly discuss the current challenges and future opportunities for the clinical translation of cancer nanomedicines."
"Curcumin has been shown highly cytotoxic towards various cancer cell lines, but its water-insolubility and instability make its bioavailability exceedingly low and thus it generally demonstrates low anticancer activity in in vivo tests. Herein, we report a novel type of polymer-drug conjugates--the high molecular weight curcumin polymers (polycurcumins) made by condensation polymerization of curcumin. The polycurcumins as backbone-type conjugates have advantages of high drug loading efficiency, fixed drug loading contents, stabilized curcumin in their backbones, and tailored water-solubility. The polycurcumins may have many potential applications and their antitumor activities are investigated in this work. The polycurcumins are cytotoxic to cancer cells, but a polyacetal-based polycurcumin (PCurc 8) is highly cytotoxic to SKOV-3, OVCAR-3 ovarian cancers, and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. It can be quickly taken up by cancer cells into their lysosomes, where PCurc 8 hydrolyzes and releases active curcumin. It arrests SKOV-3 cell cycle at G(0)/G(1) phase in vitro and induces cell apoptosis partially through the caspase-3 dependent pathway. In vivo, intravenously (i.v.) injected PCurc 8 shows remarkable antitumor activity in SKOV-3 intraperitoneal (i.p.) xenograft tumor model."
"Polymer micelles are one of the most investigated nanocarriers for drug delivery; many have entered clinical trials and some are in clinic use, but their delivery systems have not yet shown the expected high therapeutic efficacy in clinics. Further understanding their in vivo behaviors, particularly how quickly and by what mechanism polymer micelles are cleared ( i. e., via micelles or unimers) once injected, is key to solving this dilemma. Herein, we hope to answer these questions for the clinically relevant polyethylene glycol- block-poly(ε-caprolactone) (PEG-PCL) and PEG- block-poly(d,l-lactide) (PEG-PDLLA) micelles. A small fraction of the hydrophobic chain ends was conjugated with a pair of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) dyes, Cy5 and Cy5.5, and used to fabricate FRET micelles whose FRET efficiency was correlated to the percentage of polymer chains in the micelles, the micelle degree. In vitro, serum proteins induced PEG-PCL micelle dissociation to some extent; mouse serum or blood surprisingly did not induce micelle dissociation but once with shear applied by a microfluidic channel caused most PEG-PCL micelles dissociated. After intravenous administration in mice, the PEG-PCL or PEG-PDLLA micelles were quickly sequestered into the liver as unimers, and the micelle degree in the blood quickly decreased to about 20%. The FRET-imaging experiments showed that in blood vessels the micelles quickly dissociated into unimers, which were found associated with albumin in blood and in liver. Thus, it is concluded that, upon intravenous injection, the shear and the bloodborne proteins (particularly albumin) induced the most (∼80%) PEG-PCL and PEG-PDLLA micelles to quickly dissociate into unimers, which were sequestered by Kupffer cells, while intact micelles were difficult to clear. These micelles were able to penetrate tumors and were very stable with cell membranes, but dissociated gradually inside cells. These findings on in vivo micelle fate and the clearance mechanism are directional for the rational design of polymer micelles for improved therapeutics; particularly, improving micelle stability in blood is the prerequisite for surface functionalizations such as introducing targeting ligands."

"c effect of bulky groups of the catalyst can kinetically suppress the transesterification reactions by screening linear polymer chains from the active center during the polymerization of e-caprolactone (CL) with rare earth alkoxide. Therefore, isopropoxy rare earth diethyl acetoacetate ((EA)2LnOiPr Ln = Nd, Y) and Nd(OiPr)3-donor adducts (1,10-phenanthroline, 2,2‘-bipyridyl, 18-crown-6 ether) are excellent catalysts for the living polymerization of e-caprolactone, giving poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) with a narrow molecular weight distribution. Block copolymerizations of e-caprolactone with trimethylene carbonate (TMC) and d,l-lactide (LA) have been attained successfully using (EA)2LnOiPr as catalyst.

" forms of ionic liquids have many potential applications because of their high thermal stability and ionic nature. Two ionic liquid monomers, 1-(4-vinylbenzyl)-3-butyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (VBIT) and 1-(4-vinylbenzyl)-3- butyl imidazolium hexafluorophosphate (VBIH), were synthesized through the quaternization of N-butylimidazole with 4-vinylbenzylchloride and a subsequent anion- exchange reaction with sodium tetrafluoroborate or potassium hexafluorophosphate. Copper-mediated atom transfer radical polymerization was used to polymerize VBIT and VBIH. The effects of various initiator/catalyst systems, monomer concentrations, solvent polarities, and reaction temperatures on the polymerization were examined. The polymerization was well controlled and exhibited living characteristics when CuBr/1,1,4,7,10,10-hexamethyltriethylenetetramine or CuBr/2,2′-bipyridine was used as the catalyst and ethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate was used as the initiator. Characterizations by thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction showed that the resulting VBIT polymer, poly[1-(4-vinylbenzyl)-3-butyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate] (PVBIT), was amorphous and had excellent thermal stability, with a glass-transition temperature of 84 °C. The polymerized ionic liquids could absorb CO2 as ionic liquids: PVBIT absorbed 0.30% (w/w) CO2 at room temperature and 0.78 atm. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"The objective of these investigations was to test the hypothesis that a rapid cytoplasmic release profile from nanoparticles would potentiate the anticancer activity of cisplatin. Cisplatin-loaded nanoparticles with pH-responsive poly[2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (PDEA) cores were synthesized from PDEA-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PDEA-PEG) copolymer by using a solvent-displacement (acetone-water) method. Nanoparticles with pH-nonresponsive poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) cores made from PCL-block-PEG (PCL-PEG) were used for comparison. Nanoparticle sizes, zeta potentials, drug-loading capacities, and pH responsiveness were characterized. The cellular uptakes and localization in lysosomes were visualized by using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Cytostatic effects of free and encapsulated cis-diammineplatinum(II) dichloride (cisplatin) toward human SKOV-3 epithelial ovarian cancer cells were estimated by using the MTT assay. Intraperitoneal tumor responses to cisplatin and cisplatin/PDEA-PEG were evaluated in athymic mice at 4-6 weeks postinoculation of SKOV-3 cells. PDEA-PEG nanoparticles dissolved at pH < 6 and rapidly internalized and transferred to lysosomes; it therefore was predicted that the PDEA nanoparticles would rapidly release cisplatin into cytoplasm upon integration into acidic lysosomes and thereby overwhelm the chemoresistant properties of SKOV-3 cells. Indeed, relative proportions of viable cells were diminished to a greater extent by exposure in vitro to fast-releasing nanoparticles compared to slow-releasing nanoparticles or an equivalent dose of free cisplatin. Incidences of cellular pyknosis (a morphological indicator of apoptosis) were most evident within intestinal/mesentery tumors of mice treated with cisplatin/PDEA-PEG; tumor burdens were correspondingly reduced."
"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most debilitating injuries, and transplantation of stem cells in a scaffold is a promising strategy for treatment. However, stem cell treatment of SCI has been severely impaired by the increased generation of reactive oxygen species in the lesion microenvironment, which can lead to a high level of stem cell death and dysfunction. Herein, a MnO2 nanoparticle (NP)-dotted hydrogel is prepared through dispersion of MnO2 NPs in a PPFLMLLKGSTR peptide modified hyaluronic acid hydrogel. The peptide-modified hydrogel enables the adhesive growth of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and nerve tissue bridging. The MnO2 NPs alleviate the oxidative environment, thereby effectively improving the viability of MSCs. Transplantation of MSCs in the multifunctional gel generates a significant motor function restoration on a long-span rat spinal cord transection model and induces an in vivo integration as well as neural differentiation of the implanted MSCs, leading to a highly efficient regeneration of central nervous spinal cord tissue. Therefore, the MnO2 NP-dotted hydrogel represents a promising strategy for stem-cell-based therapies of central nervous system diseases through the comprehensive regulation of pathological microenvironment complications."
"Effective anticancer nanomedicines need to exhibit prolonged circulation in blood, to extravasate and accumulate in tumours, and to be taken up by tumour cells. These contrasting criteria for persistent circulation and cell-membrane affinity have often led to complex nanoparticle designs with hampered clinical translatability. Here, we show that conjugates of small-molecule anticancer drugs with the polyzwitterion poly(2-(N-oxide-N,N-diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) have long blood-circulation half-lives and bind reversibly to cell membranes, owing to the negligible interaction of the polyzwitterion with proteins and its weak interaction with phospholipids. Adsorption of the polyzwitterion-drug conjugates to tumour endothelial cells and then to cancer cells favoured their transcytosis-mediated extravasation into tumour interstitium and infiltration into tumours, and led to the eradication of large tumours and patient-derived tumour xenografts in mice. The simplicity and potency of the polyzwitterion-drug conjugates should facilitate the design of translational anticancer nanomedicines."

"esis of water-soluble macromonomers of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) was studied in detail. The survival of the unsaturated groups in the initiators during the macromonomer preparation as well as the initiator efficiency depended on the nature of initiator and type of ligand used. The kinetics of the ATRP of DMAEMA catalyzed by allyl 2-bromoisobutyrate (ABIB)/copper bromide (CuBr)/N,N,N‘,N‘,N‘ ‘-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) system at different conditions indicated that the low initiator efficiency of the ATRP system could not be improved by increasing temperature or changing solvents. It was found that ABIB/CuBr/tris(2-di(butylacrylate)aminoethyl)amine (BA6-TREN) and allyl trichloroacetamide (ATCA)/CuBr/BA6-TREN gave high initiator efficiencies and excellent control over the molecular weights and molecular weight distributions in the ATRP of DMAEMA. 1H NMR studies confirmed that each polyDMAEMA chain had a polymerizable allyl..."
"Microwave stealth technology with optical transparency is of great significance for solar-powered aircrafts (e.g., satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles) in increasingly complex electromagnetic environments. By coating them with optically transparent absorbing materials or devices, these large-sized solar panels could avoid detection by radar while maintaining highly efficient collection of solar energy. However, conventional microwave-absorbing materials/devices for solar panels suffer from bulky volume and fixed stealth performance that significantly hinders their practicality or multifunctionality. Particularly, dynamic modulation of microwave absorption for dual polarization remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose the design, fabrication, and characterization of an optically transparent and dynamically tunable microwave-absorbing metasurface that enables dual modulations (amplitude and frequency) independently for two orthogonal linearly polarized excitations. The tunability of the proposed metasurface is guaranteed by an elaborately designed anisotropic meta-atom composed of a patterned graphene structure whose electromagnetic responses for different polarizations can be dynamically and independently controlled via bias voltages. The dual tunability in such a graphene-based absorbing metasurface is experimentally measured, which agrees well with those numerical results. We further build an equivalent lumped circuit model to analyze the physical relation between the tunable sheet resistance of graphene and the polarization-independent modulations of the metasurface. Taking into account the advantages of optical transparency and flexibility, the proposed microwave-absorbing metasurface significantly enhances the multitasking stealth performance in complex scenarios and has the potential for advanced solar energy devices."

"ressure isothermal sorption of CO2 in poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) with varied structures including different cations, anions, backbones, and substituents was investigated to probe structure effects on the CO2 sorption. An ammonium cation with short alkyl group, BF4 anion, and polystyrene backbone was found to favor CO2 sorption in PILs. CO2 sorption in the PILs fitted the dual-mode model very well, suggesting that the CO2 sorption consists of dissolution in the polymer matrix and Langmuir sorption in the microvoids."
"Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) generally requires a catalyst/initiator molar ratio of 0.1 to 1 and catalyst/monomer molar ratio of 0.001 to 0.01 (i.e., catalyst concentration: 1000-10,000 ppm versus monomer). Herein, we report a new copper-based complex CuBr/N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) as a versatile and highly active catalyst for acrylic, methacrylic, and styrenic monomers. The catalyst mediated ATRP at a catalyst/initiator molar ratio of 0.005 and produced polymers with well-controlled molecular weights and low polydispersities. ATRP occurred even at a catalyst/initiator molar ratio as low as 0.001 with copper concentration in the produced polymers as low as 6-8 ppm (catalyst/monomer molar ratio = 10(-5)). The catalyst structures were studied by X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy. The activator CuIBr/TPEN existed in solution as binuclear and mononuclear complexes in equilibrium but as a binuclear complex in its single crystals. The deactivator CuIIBr2/TPEN complex was mononuclear. High stability and appropriate KATRP (ATRP equilibrium constant) were found crucial for the catalyst working under high dilution or in coordinating solvents/monomers. This provides guidance for further design of highly active ATRP catalysts."

Separating proteins from biomaterials and studying their structures and functions are of great significance for understanding the law of life activities and clarifying the essence of life phenomena. Therefore, scientists have proposed the new concept of proteomics, in which protein separation technology plays a momentous role. It has been diffusely used in the food industry, agricultural biological research, drug development, disease mechanism, plant stress mechanism, and marine environment research. In this paper, combined with the recent research situation, the progress of protein separation technology was reviewed from the aspects of extraction, precipitation, membrane separation, chromatography, electrophoresis, molecular imprinting, microfluidic chip and so on."
"In recent years, people have been actively exploring new imaging methods with high biological imaging performance because the clinical image definition and depth in vivo cannot meet the requirements of early diagnosis and prognosis. Based on the traditional near-infrared region I (NIR-I), the molecular probe of the near-infrared region II (NIR-II) is further explored and developed. In the NIR-II region due to the wavelength is longer than the NIR-I region can effectively reduce the molecular scattering, optical absorption of the organization, the organization of spontaneous fluorescence negligible, thus the NIR-II Fluorescence imaging (FI) can get deeper penetration depth, higher signal-to-background ratio (SBR) and better spatiotemporal resolution, FI in NIR-II region are an important and rapidly developing research region for future imaging. In the NIR-II fluorophore, small organic molecule fluorophore has attracted much attention because of its good biocompatibility and good pharmacokinetic properties. In this review, we briefly introduced the existing NIR-II organic small molecule fluorophores, and introduced the existing relatively mature methods for improving quantum yield and water solubility, and the small molecule dyes on FI of various improvement methods, also briefly introduces the small molecules of photoacoustic imaging (PAI), and a brief introduction of imaging-guided surgery (IGS) for some small organic molecules, finally, a reasonable prospect is made for the development of small organic molecules."

"Herein, a new adsorbent Nitrilotriacetic acid β-Cyclodextrin-Chitosan (NTA-β-CD-CS) was synthesized for the effective simultaneous removal of dyes and metals. In this process, the β-CD cavities captured Methylene blue (MB) by host/guest contacts, and the remaining functional groups were able to act as adsorption sites for metal ions and Methyl orange (MO). In the single process, the maximum adsorption capacities of NTA-β-CD-CS adsorbent toward the Hg (II) MB and MO were 178.3, 162.6, and 132.5 mg/g, respectively. Sips and Langmuir's model were appropriate to define the adsorption system and mechanism. Most prominently, the NTA-β-CD-CS adsorbent was highly effective in the simultaneous adsorption of metals and cationic dyes and remained consistent with the mono system. The adsorbent performance efficiency remained constant even after four cycles. Therefore, the advantages of non-toxic chemicals, excellent adsorption, and regeneration performance revealed that NTA-β-CD-CS possessed great potential to treat realistic and model wastewater from different industries."
" nanoparticles made from polymer micelles have been widely explored as drug carriers for targeted drug delivery. High stability (i.e., low critical micelle concentration (CMC)) is required for their intravenous applications. Herein, we present a ""core-surface cross-linking"" concept to greatly enhance nanoparticle's stability: amphiphilic brush copolymers form core-surface cross-linked micelles (nanoparticles) (SCNs). The amphiphilic brush copolymers consisted of hydrophobic poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or poly(2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMA) chains were synthesized by macromonomer copolymerization method and used to demonstrate this concept. The resulting SCNs were about 100 times more stable than micelles from corresponding amphiphilic block copolymers. The size and surface properties of the SCNs could be easily tailored by the copolymer's compositions."
"rch on advanced functional polymers is being driven by the fast-growing demand for new functional materials that can be used in revolutionary technologies. Polymers can be endowed with functions by using certain special preparation methods or by introducing functional groups or fillers into materials. These functions are either intrinsically possessed by materials or actuated by external stimuli. In this review, we present an overview of the recent developments made in the research hotspots of functional polymers, encompassing polymerization methodologies, luminescent polymers, photovoltaic polymers, other electronic and optical polymers (including low-k polyimides and second-order nonlinear optical polymers), biorelated polymers (particularly those for biomedical applications), supramolecular polymers, stimuli-responsive polymers, shape-memory polymers, separation polymer membranes, energy storage polymers, and covalent organic framework polymers. The concepts, design strategies at the molecular level, preparation methods, classifications, properties, potential applications, and recent progress made in such polymers are summarized. Challenges and future perspectives of each type of functional polymers are also addressed, including research efforts regarding the design and fabrication of functional polymers for serving the increasing demand for new materials."
" forms of ionic liquids may have many potential applications because of their high thermal stability and ionic nature. They are generally synthesized by conventional free-radical polymerization. Here we report a living/controlled free-radical polymerization of an ionic liquid monomer, 2-(1-butylimidazolium-3-yl)ethyl methacrylate tetrafluoroborate (BIMT), via atom transfer radical polymerization. Copper bromide/bromide based initiator systems polymerized BIMT very quickly with little control because of fast activation but slow deactivation. With copper chloride as the catalyst and trichloroacetate, CCl 4 , or ethyl a-chlorophenylacetate as the initiator, BIMT was polymerized at 60 °C in acetonitrile with first-order kinetics with respect to the monomer concentration. The molecular weight was linearly dependent on the conversion. The monomer concentration strongly affected the polymerization: a low monomer concentration caused the polymerization to be incomplete, probably because of catalyst disproportionation in polar solvents. The addition of a small amount of pyridine suppressed such disproportionation, but a further increase in the amount of pyridine greatly slowed the polymerization."
"gel support system for the copper bromide−hexamethyltriethylenetetramine (HMTETA) complex was successfully developed for the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of methyl methacrylate (MMA) in toluene. The supported complex mediated a living polymerization of MMA, yielding polymers with controlled molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions. The MMA concentration had significant influence on the polymerization behavior. At 33% MMA concentration, the polymerization catalyzed by CuBr−HMTETA/silica gel followed typical first-order kinetics with respect to the monomer. But at 50% MMA, the polymerization significantly deviated from the first-order kinetics after the MMA conversion reached 30%. The supported catalysts were recycled for second and third uses. The recycled catalysts remained 80% active in the second use and 50% in the third use relative to their initial activity. The recycled catalysts had even better controllability over the polymerization. The molecular weights ..."
" fibrotic stroma in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) resists drug diffusion into tumor and leads to unsatisfied prognosis. To address this problem, we demonstrate a dendrimer-camptothecin (CPT) conjugate that actively penetrates deep into PDA tumor through γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)-triggered cell endocytosis and transcytosis. The dendrimer-drug conjugate was synthesized by covalent attachment of CPT to polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive linker followed with surface modification with glutathione. Once the conjugate was delivered to the PDA tumor periphery, the overexpressed GGT on the vascular endothelial cell or tumor cell triggers the -glutamyl transfer reactions of glutathione to produce primary amines. The positively charged conjugate rapidly internalized via caveolae-mediated endocytosis and followed by vesicle-mediated transcytosis, augmenting its deep penetration within the tumor parenchyma and releasing active CPT throughout the tumor after cleavage by intracellular ROS. The dendrimer-drug conjugate exhibited high antitumor activity in multiple mice tumor models, including patient-derived PDA xenograft and orthotopic PDA cell xenograft, compared to the standard first-line chemotherapeutic drug (gemcitabine) for advanced pancreatic cancer. This study demonstrates the high efficiency of an active tumor penetrating dendrimer-drug conjugate via transcytotic transport with ROS-responsive drug release for PDA therapy."
"Nanoparticles have been developed for tumor treatment due to the enhanced permeability and retention effects. However, lack of specific cancer cells selectivity results in low delivery efficiency and undesired side effects. In that case, the stimuli-responsive nanoparticles system designed for the specific structure and physicochemical properties of tumors have attracted more and more attention of researchers. Esterase-responsive nanoparticle system is widely used due to the overexpressed esterase in tumor cells. For a rational designed esterase-responsive nanoparticle, ester bonds and nanoparticle structures are the key characters. In this review, we overviewed the design of esterase-responsive nanoparticles, including ester bonds design and nano-structure design, and analyzed the fitness of each design for different application. In the end, the outlook of esterase-responsive nanoparticle is looking forward."
"Nanosystems with unique physical and biological properties have been extensively explored for cancer targeted intracellular delivery of small-molecular chemotherapeutic drugs to increase their therapeutic efficacies and to minimize their side effects. A large number of anticancer drugs are DNA-toxins that bind nuclear DNA or its associated enzymes to exert their cytotoxicity to cancer cells. After entering tumor cells, they need to be further delivered to the nucleus for actions. Herein, we discuss the biological barriers and summarize recent progress of nuclear drug delivery for cancer chemotherapy, emphasizing strategies that appear useful for design of vehicles capable of delivering drugs to the nucleus, particularly for in vivo applications. The existing obstacles or problems that need to be overcome before successful applications of nuclear drug delivery for cancer chemotherapy are also discussed."
"Over the past three decades, the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect has been considered the basis of tumor-targeted drug delivery. Various cancer nanomedicines, including macromolecular drugs, have been designed to utilize this mechanism for preferential extravasation and accumulation in solid tumors. However, such nanomedicines have not yet achieved convincing therapeutic benefits in clinics. Increasing evidence suggests that the EPR effect is over-represented in human tumors, especially in metastatic tumors. This review covers the evolution of the concept, the heterogeneity and limitation of the EPR effect in clinical realities, and prospects for alternative strategies independent of the EPR effect."
"Real-time tracking for where (W), when (W), and how (H) prodrugs are delivered and activated in vivo is a great challenge for prodrug development. Disulfide linkage-based prodrugs as well as their delivery systems have been studied extensively, but the WWH question in spatial and temporal (spatiotemporal) precision remains unanswered. Herein, we present a novel prodrug of camptothecin (CPT) linked to a near-infrared (NIR) cyanine dye via a disulfide linkage (Cy-S-CPT). The cleavage of the disulfide bond in Cy-S-CPT by endogenous glutathione (GSH) can activate the anti-cancer drug CPT and induce a remarkable fluorescence shift from 825 to 650 nm, thereby providing dual fluorescent channels to real-time track the prodrug biodistribution and activation in vivo. Impressively, the dual-channel NIR fluorescence bioimaging exhibits the pervasive drug distribution, i.e., the biodistribution of the intact prodrug was traced at the 825 nm-NIR fluorescence channel, whereas the activated drug was tracked at the 650 nm red fluorescence channel. In this way, we can overcome the blind spot in the metabolism kinetics of prodrugs in a certain organ or tissue. As demonstrated, the prodrug prompts activation in all the organs, particularly in the liver after an intravenous injection, and achieves predominant accumulation and activation in tumors at 24 h post injection. Cy-S-CPT loaded in PEG-PLA nanoparticles display significantly improved therapeutic efficacy and low side effects with respect to the clinical used drug CPT-11. As a consequence, the NIR spatiotemporal bioimaging in vivo with dual fluorescence channels allows the prodrug release profile to be extracted precisely, particularly in visualizing drug-released information from complex biological systems such as mice, thereby providing a unique opportunity to take insight into the relationship between theranosis and pharmacokinetics."

"IV) prodrug diaminedichlorodihydroxyplatinum (ACHP) conjugated with a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VA), VAAP, exhibited strong synergistic cytotoxicity, about 50-100 times more cytotoxic than ACHP or its simple mixture with VA, against various human carcinoma cell lines. VAAP could be quickly absorbed in the cell membrane and diffused into the cytosol. VAAP loaded in polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone micelles (PEG-PCL) was taken up via endocytosis. The cytosolic VAAP was intracellular reduced to Pt(II) and released VA eliciting a HDAC inhibitory effect and subsequently induced cell cycle arrest at the S phase in 24 h and cell apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. The in vivo antitumor experiment on A549-xenograft tumor model showed that VAAP dispersed in Tween 80 or loaded in PEG-PCL nanoparticles had long blood circulation times and thereby high accumulation in tumors and exerted a significant in vivo inhibitory effect on tumor growth with low systemic toxicity. Therefore, this novel conjugate is very promising for cancer chemotherapy."
"ous column reactor packed with silica gel supported CuBr-HMTETA catalyst has been successfully developed for ATRP of MMA. The reactor had a good catalytic stability up to 100 h. The MMA conversion decreased with an increasing feeding flow rate. The polymerization kinetics was first order with respect to the monomer. The molecular weight increased linearly with conversion, demonstrating the living character. Possible flow back-mixing and polymer trapping in the pores of silica gel caused some broadening in the molecular weight distribution. This type of packed column reactor is believed to be a significant development for possible commercial exploitation of the ATRP process."
"Curcumin has been shown to have high cytotoxicity towards various cancer cell lines, but its water insolubility and instability make its bioavailability exceedingly low and, thus, it is generally inactive in in vivo anticancer tests. Here, we report an intracellular-labile amphiphilic surfactant-like curcumin prodrug--curcumin conjugated with two short oligo(ethylene glycol) (Curc-OEG) chains via beta-thioester bonds that are labile in the presence of intracellular glutathione and esterase. Curc-OEG formed stable nanoparticles in aqueous conditions and served two roles--as an anticancer prodrug and a drug carrier. As an anticancer prodrug, the formed nanoparticles had a high and fixed curcumin-loading content of 25.3 wt%, and released active curcumin in the intracellular environment. Curc-OEG had high inhibition ability to several cancer cell lines due to apoptosis. Intravenously injected Curc-OEG significantly reduced the tumor weights and tumor numbers in the athymic mice xenografted with intraperitoneal SKOV-3 tumors and subcutaneous (mammary fat pad) MDA-MB-468 tumors. Preliminary systemic toxicity studies found that Curc-OEG did not cause acute and subchronic toxicities to mouse visceral organs at high doses. As drug carriers, Curc-OEG nanoparticles could carry other anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin and camptothecin, and ship them into drug-resistant cells, greatly enhancing the cytotoxicity of the loaded drug. Thus, Curc-OEG is a promising prototype that merits further study for cancer therapy."
"Fast cytoplasmic drug delivery can overcome cancer cells' drug resistance and thus have an enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Such a drug delivery regime requires drug carriers capable of entering cancer cells, localizing and rapidly releasing the drug into endosomes/lysosomes, and subsequently disrupting their membranes to release the drug into the cytosol. We herein report a low-toxic and degradable poly(beta-amino ester)-graft-polyethylene glycol (BAE-PEG) co-polymer forming pH-responsive nanoparticles capable of cytoplasmic drug delivery. BAE-PEG was synthesized by condensation polymerization of diacrylate and piperazine in the presence of a PEG-diacrylate macromonomer. BAE-PEG with 2% or 5% PEG side chains formed micelles (nanoparticles) with diameters of about 100 nm. The BAE-PEG nanoparticles were shown to rapidly enter cancer cells, localize in their endosomes/lysosomes, and subsequently disrupt them to release the drugs into the cytosol. Camptothecin loaded in the nanoparticles had a higher cytotoxicity to SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells than free camptothecin."
"tin is a potent chemotherapeutic agent with broad‐spectrum antineoplastic activity against various types of tumours. However, a major factor limiting treatment with cisplatin is its acute and cumulative cardiotoxicity. The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of cisplatin on myocardial contractile function and the possible underlying cellular mechanisms."
"active and versatile CuBr 2 /N,N,N',N'-tetra[(2-pyridal)methyl]ethylenediamine (CuBr 2 /TPEN)-tertiary amine catalyst system has been developed for atom transfer radical polymerization via activator-generated-by-electron-transfer (AGET ATRP). The catalyst mediates good control of the AGETATRPs of methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, and styrene at 1 mol-% catalyst relative to initiator. A mechanism study shows that tertiary amines such as triethylamine reduces the CuBr 2 /TPEN complex to CuBr/TPEN."
"ing polymerization of e-caprolactone catalyzed by rare earth halides and rare earth halide−epoxide has been carried out for the first time. It was found that rare earth halides have low activities for the polymerization of e-caprolactone, but in the presence of epoxide, rare earth halides are highly active for the bulk and solution polymerization of e-caprolactone, with high molecular weight poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) formed. With the NdCl3−20PO system, PCL with a molecular weight of 22.4 × 104 can be easily obtained at 30 °C, and the molecular weight of PCL can be increased to 42 × 104 at 60 °C with a catalyst efficiency of 100 × 104 g of PCL/mol of NdCl3. The catalytic activities of the rare earth halides are affected by the kind of rare earth element, halogen, epoxide, amount of added epoxide, catalyst concentration, and polymerization temperature. It has been found that rare earth halides react with epoxide and produce halogen rare earth alkoxides:  (X3-xLn{[OCH(R)CH2]yX}x, X = Cl, Br, I). A ..."
"Neural stem cells (NSCs), capable of ischemia-homing, regeneration, and differentiation, exert strong therapeutic potentials in treating ischemic stroke, but the curative effect is limited in the harsh microenvironment of ischemic regions rich in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Gene transfection to make NSCs overexpress brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can enhance their therapeutic efficacy; however, viral vectors must be used because current nonviral vectors are unable to efficiently transfect NSCs. The first polymeric vector, ROS-responsive charge-reversal poly[(2-acryloyl)ethyl(p-boronic acid benzyl)diethylammonium bromide] (B-PDEA), is shown here, that mediates efficient gene transfection of NSCs and greatly enhances their therapeutics in ischemic stroke treatment. The cationic B-PDEA/DNA polyplexes can effectively transfect NSCs; in the cytosol, the B-PDEA is oxidized by intracellular ROS into negatively charged polyacrylic acid, quickly releasing the BDNF plasmids for efficient transcription and secreting a high level of BDNF. After i.v. injection in ischemic stroke mice, the transfected NSCs (BDNF-NSCs) can home to ischemic regions as efficiently as the pristine NSCs but more efficiently produce BDNF, leading to significantly augmented BDNF levels, which in turn enhances the mouse survival rate to 60%, from 0% (nontreated mice) or ≈20% (NSC-treated mice), and enables more rapid and superior functional reconstruction."
Reduction-controlled hierarchical unpacking is proposed for the development of virus-mimicking gene carriers. Disulfide-bond-modified hyaluronic acid (HA) is deposited onto the surface of diselenide-conjugated oligoethylenimine/DNA polyplexes to form DNA/OEI-SeSex/HA-SS-COOH (DOS) polyplexes. The cleavage of the disulfide and diselenide bonds is triggered by the gradient GSH level at the tumor site and inside the cells. The transfection efficiency of DOS show significant enhancement over DNA/poly(ethylene imine) (DP) in vitro and in vivo.
" dendrimers are attractive for in vivo delivery of bioactive molecules due to their biodegradability, but their synthesis generally requires multistep reactions with intensive purifications. A highly efficient approach to the synthesis of dendrimers by simply ""sticking"" generation by generation together is achieved by combining kinetic or mechanistic chemoselectivity with click reactions between the monomers. In each generation, the targeted molecules are the major reaction product as detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The only separation needed is to remove the little unreacted monomer by simple precipitation or washing. This simple clicklike process without complicated purification is particularly suitable for the synthesis of custom-made polyester dendrimers."

"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most devastating injuries. Treatment strategies for SCI are required to overcome comprehensive issues. Implantation of biomaterial scaffolds and stem cells has been demonstrated to be a promising strategy. However, a comprehensive recovery effect is difficult to achieve. In the comprehensive treatment process, the specific roles of the implanted scaffolds and of stem cells in combined strategy are usually neglected. In this study, a peptide-modified scaffold is developed based on hyaluronic acid and an adhesive peptide PPFLMLLKGSTR. Synchrotron radiation micro computed tomography measurement provides insights to the three-dimensional inner topographical property and perspective porous structure of the scaffold. The modified scaffold significantly improves cellular survival and adhesive growth of mesenchymal stem cells during 3D culture in vitro. After implantation in transected spinal cord, the modified scaffold and mesenchymal stems are found to function in synergy to restore injured spinal cord tissue, with respective strengths. Hindlimb motor function scores exhibit the most significant impact of the composite implant at 2 weeks post injury, which is the time secondary injury factors begin to take hold. Investigation on the secondary injury factors including inflammatory response and astrocyte overactivity at 10 days post injury reveals the possible underlying reason. Implants of the scaffold, cells, and especially the combination of both elicit inhibitory effects on these adverse factors. The study develops a promising implant for spinal cord tissue engineering and reveals the roles of the scaffold and stem cells. More importantly, the results provide the first understanding of the bioactive peptide PPFLMLLKGSTR concerning its functions on mesenchymal stem cells and spinal cord tissue restoration."
"Most nonviral gene delivery systems are not efficient enough to manipulate the difficult-to-transfect cell types, including non-dividing, primary, neuronal or stem cells, due to a lack of an intrinsic capacity to enter the membrane and nucleus, release its DNA payload, and activate transcription. Noble metal nanoclusters have emerged as a fascinating area of widespread interest in nanomaterials. Herein, we report the synthesis of the TAT peptide conjugated cationic noble metal nanoparticles (metal NPs@PEI-TAT) as highly efficient carriers for gene delivery to stem cells. The metal NPs@PEI-TAT integrate the advantages of metal NPs and peptides: the presence of metal NPs can effectively decrease the cytotoxicity of cationic molecules, making it possible to apply them in biological systems, while the cell penetrating peptides are essential for enhanced cellular and nucleus entry to achieve high transfection efficiency. Our studies provide strong evidence that the metal NPs@PEI-TAT can be engineered as gene delivery agents for stem cells and subsequently enhance their directed differentiation for biomedical application."
"A novel strategy of preparing multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs) with near infra red (NIR) fluorescence and magnetism showing good hydrophilicity and low toxicity was developed via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization with activators generated by electron transfer (AGET ATRP) of poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) and glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) employing biocompatible iron as the catalyst on the surface of silica coated iron oxide (Fe3O4@SiO2) NPs. The small molecules (CS2), a NIR fluorescent chromophore, can be fixed into the covalently grafted polymer shell of the NPs by chemical reaction through a covalent bond to obtain stable CS2 dotted NPs Fe3O4@SiO2@PPEGMA-co-PGMA@CS2. The fluorescence intensity of the as-prepared NPs could be conveniently regulated by altering the silica shell thickness (varying the feed of silica source TEOS), CS2 feed, or the feed ratio of VPEGMA/VGMA, which are easily realized in the preparation process. Thorough investigation of the properties of the final NPs including in vivo dual modal imaging indicate that such NPs are one of the competitive candidates as imaging agents proving a promising potential in the biomedical area."
"Cellulose-graft-poly(N,N-dimethylamino-2-ethyl methacrylate) (cellulose-g-PDMAEMA) copolymers were prepared by homogeneous atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) under mild conditions. Cellulose macroinitiator was successfully synthesized by direct acylation of cellulose with 2-bromopropionyl bromide in a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL), 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride. Copolymers were obtained via ATRP of N,N-dimethylamino-2-ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) with CuBr/pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) as catalyst and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent without homopolymer byproduct. The grafting copolymers were characterized by (1)H NMR, FT-IR, and TGA measurements. The results confirmed that PDMAEMA had been covalently bonded to cellulose backbone. Furthermore, the assemblies or aggregates formed by cellulose-g-PDMAEMA copolymers in water were studied at various concentrations, temperatures, and pH values by means of UV, DLS, TEM, and AFM. The results indicate that the copolymers had the pH- and temperature-responsive properties similar to the expected stimuli-responses by PDMAEMA. The synthetic strategy presented here could be employed in the preparation of other novel biomaterials from a variety of polysaccharides."

"The clinical utility of doxorubicin (DOX) is restricted by its severe side effects. Continuous efforts are aimed at developing efficacious DOX-delivery systems that may overcome the drawbacks of existing ones. Herein, we report a self-assembling prodrug forming high drug loading nanoparticles for DOX delivery. A low molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain as the hydrophilic part was anchored to hydrophobic DOX via an acid-cleavable hydrazone bond to form the amphiphilic prodrug PEG-DOX. In aqueous solution, PEG-DOX formed nanoparticles with a diameter of ∼125 nm and extremely high drug loading (∼46 wt%). These nanoparticles were stable in PBS but released DOX in an acidic pH-triggered manner. Interestingly, taken up by cells via endocytosis, PEG-DOX bypassed the P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated efflux of DOX, leading to drug accumulation in DOX-resistant human breast cancer cells (MCF-7/ADR). More importantly, PEG-DOX exhibited potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo, and showed significantly increased in vivo safety than free DOX. These encouraging data merit further preclinical and clinical development on PEG-DOX."
"The structural preciseness of dendrimers makes them perfect drug delivery carriers, particularly in the form of dendrimer-drug conjugates. Current dendrimer-drug conjugates are synthesized by anchoring drug and functional moieties onto the dendrimer peripheral surface. However, functional groups exhibiting the same reactivity make it impossible to precisely control the number and the position of the functional groups and drug molecules anchored to the dendrimer surface. This structural heterogeneity causes variable pharmacokinetics, preventing such conjugates to be translational. Furthermore, the highly hydrophobic drug molecules anchored on the dendrimer periphery can interact with blood components and alter the pharmacokinetic behavior. To address these problems, we herein report molecularly precise dendrimer-drug conjugates with drug moieties buried inside the dendrimers. Surprisingly, the drug release rates of these conjugates were tailorable by the dendrimer generation, surface chemistry, and acidity."
" polyester dendrimers are attractive carriers for in vivo delivery of bioactive molecules due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability, but efficient precision synthesis of these dendrimers without tedious purifications remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis approach to polyester dendrimers from two AB2-type monomers via combining a click reaction of thiol/acrylate Michael addition with esterification. The reaction solution of each generation contains only the targeted dendrimer macromolecules; thus, the only required separation is simple precipitation. The resulting hydroxyl-terminated fifth-gener- ation dendrimer is thermoresponsive with a LCST of 41 °C. The dendrimer could be further pegylated to obtain a water-soluble biocompatible dendrimer capable of encapsulation and controlled release of a hydrophobic anticancer drug, doxorubicin."

"Traditional herbal medicine (THM), an ancient science, is a gift from nature. For thousands of years, it has helped humans fight diseases and protect life, health, and reproduction. Nanomedicine, a newer discipline has evolved from exploitation of the unique nanoscale morphology and is widely used in diagnosis, imaging, drug delivery, and other biomedical fields. Although THM and nanomedicine differ greatly in time span and discipline dimensions, they are closely related and are even evolving toward integration and convergence. This review begins with the history and latest research progress of THM and nanomedicine, expounding their respective developmental trajectory. It then discusses the overlapping connectivity and relevance of the two fields, including nanoaggregates generated in herbal medicine decoctions, the application of nanotechnology in the delivery and treatment of natural active ingredients, and the influence of physiological regulatory capability of THM on the in vivo fate of nanoparticles. Finally, future development trends, challenges, and research directions are discussed."
"anoparticles are extensively explored as drug carriers but they generally have issues of premature burst drug release, slow cellular uptake, and retention in acidic intracellular compartments. Herein, we report multifunctioning three-layered nanoparticles (3LNPs) that can overcome these problems. The 3LNPs have a poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) core, a pH-responsive poly[2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate](PDEA) middle layer and a polyethylene glycol (PEG) outer layer. The pH-responsive PDEA layer is insoluble at pH above 7 but becomes positively charged and soluble via protonation at pH lower than 6.5. Thus, this layer has three functions: it covers on the PCL core inhibiting the premature burst drug release at the physiological pH, becomes positively charged and thus promotes endocytosis for fast cellular internalization in the acidic interstitium of solid tumors, and is highly positively charged in lysosomes to disrupt the lysosomal membrane and release the nanoparticle into the cytosol. The multifunctioning nanoparticles are an efficient carrier for cancer cytosolic drug delivery. © 2008 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2008"
"Liposomes are the first and mostly explored nanocarriers for cancer drug delivery, which have shown great promise in clinical applications, but their limited accumulation and penetration into the tumor interstitial space, significantly reduce the therapeutic efficacy. Here, a γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT)-triggered charge-switchable approach is reported that can trigger the fast endocytosis and transcytosis of the liposome in tumor microenvironments to overcome the harsh biological barriers in tumor tissues. The active transporting liposomal nanocarrier (GCSDL) is prepared by surface modification with a glutathione (GSH) moiety and encapsulated with doxorubicin (DOX). When the GCSDL contacts with tumor vascular endothelial cells, the overexpressed GGT enzyme on cytomembrane catalyzes the hydrolysis of GSH to generate cationic primary amines. The cationic GCSDL triggers fast caveolae-mediated endocytosis and vesicle-mediated transcytosis, resulting in sequential transcytosis to augment its tumor accumulation and penetration. Along with continual intercellular transportation, GCSDL can release DOX throughout the tumor to induce cancer cell apoptosis, resulting in complete eradication of hepatocellular carcinoma and cessation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma's progression. This study develops an efficient strategy to realize high tumor accumulation and deep penetration for the liposomal drug delivery system via active transcytosis."
"Development of highly robust and solar-light-responsive photocatalysts for the disposal of organic dyes from wastewater is a matter of great significance in order to solve the problems of water pollution. Solar-driven photocatalytic degradation of dyes is considered as a quite efficient, sustainable and cost-effective approach as it involved the inexhaustible and renewable source of energy. In photocatalytic processes, the generation of electron-hole pairs at the surface of the photocatalyst is accomplished by harvesting solar energy. The electron-hole pairs are converted into •OH radicals that are responsible for the degradation of dyes. Herein, we reported the synthesis of nanosized iron (FeNPs) using the aqueous fruit extract of Actinidia chinensis as a reducing as well as the stabilizing agent. The structure and morphology of synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using various advanced techniques. The TEM micrographs showed that the synthesized FeNPs was predominantly cubic and rod-shaped having the size in the range of 91.78-107 nm. The as-prepared FeNPs were acted as effective photocatalysts and their photocatalytic activity evaluated against alizarin yellow R (AYR) dye. The effect of different reaction conditions such as temperature, pH, time and catalyst loading on photocatalytic degradation of AYR dye was investigated under sunlight irradiation. The FeNPs showed promising photocatalytic activity and up to 93.7% of the dye was degraded in 42 h. The kinetics parameter of the reaction was also evaluated which showed that the photocatalytic degradation of AYR dye followed the pseudo-first-order reaction. In terms of better degradation, the role of FeNPs might be extended for the treatment of different organic dyes from wastewater."
"yl-containing initiators 2-vinyloxyethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate (VBIB) and 3-vinyloxylpropyl trichloroacetamide (VTCA) were synthesized for the preparation of vinyl-terminated macromonomers of different monomers by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Catalyzed by CuBr/hexamethyltriethylenetetramine (CuBr/HMTETA), the ATRP processes initiated by VBIB (for MMA, DMAEMA, and styrene) and VTCA (for MMA and DMAEMA) followed a first-order kinetics with respect to the monomer concentration. The molecular weights of the resulting polymers were very close to their calculated values and increased with the conversion. The GPC traces showed that the vinyl moiety in the initiators did not participate the polymerization at conversions below 80% during the ATRP processes of DMAEMA in bulk and those of MMA and styrene in γ-butyrolactone (γBL).

"Stimulus-responsive shape-shifting polymers1-3 have shown unique promise in emerging applications, including soft robotics4-7, medical devices8, aerospace structures9 and flexible electronics10. Their externally triggered shape-shifting behaviour offers on-demand controllability essential for many device applications. Ironically, accessing external triggers (for example, heating or light) under realistic scenarios has become the greatest bottleneck in demanding applications such as implantable medical devices8. Certain shape-shifting polymers rely on naturally present stimuli (for example, human body temperature for implantable devices)8 as triggers. Although they forgo the need for external stimulation, the ability to control recovery onset is also lost. Naturally triggered, yet actively controllable, shape-shifting behaviour is highly desirable but these two attributes are conflicting. Here we achieved this goal with a four-dimensional printable shape memory hydrogel that operates via phase separation, with its shape-shifting kinetics dominated by internal mass diffusion rather than by heat transport used for common shape memory polymers8-11. This hydrogel can undergo shape transformation at natural ambient temperature, critically with a recovery onset delay. This delay is programmable by altering the degree of phase separation during device programming, which offers a unique mechanism for shape-shifting control. Our naturally triggered shape memory polymer with a tunable recovery onset markedly lowers the barrier for device implementation."
"ndom copolymers of ϵ-caprolactone (CL) and D,L-lactide (LA) were synthesized by a new catalyst system, rare earth chloride–propylene oxide (PO) system. In the presence of propylene oxide, all rare earth chlorides tested are highly effective for the copolymerization. The influences of reaction conditions on the copolymerization catalyzed by the NdCl3-5PO system have been investigated in detail. The reactivity ratios of ϵ-caprolactone and D,L-lactide were determined and show that the copolymerization with this new rare earth catalyst is closer to ideal copolymerization than reported for other catalysts. The microstructure of copolymer analyzed by 13C-NMR shows that the monomer units in the copolymer is near to completely random distribution with a short average monomer sequence length. The DSC measurement confirms the high randomness of the chain structure. The mechanism studied by NMR indicates that the rare earth alkoxide generated by the reaction of rare earth chloride with propylene oxide initiates the copolymerization, and then proceeds via a “coordination-insertion” mechanism with acyl-oxygen bond cleavage of CL and LA. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."
"Anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies are currently used in the clinic to interupt the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint, which reverses T cell dysfunction/exhaustion and shows success in treating cancer. Here, we report a histone demethylase inhibitor, 5-carboxy-8-hydroxyquinoline (IOX1), which inhibits tumour histone demethylase Jumonji domain-containing 1A (JMJD1A) and thus downregulates its downstream β-catenin and subsequent PD-L1, providing an antibody-independent paradigm interrupting the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint. Synergistically, IOX1 inhibits cancer cells' P-glycoproteins (P-gp) through the JMJD1A/β-catenin/P-gp pathway and greatly enhances doxorubicin (DOX)-induced immune-stimulatory immunogenic cell death. As a result, the IOX1 and DOX combination greatly promotes T cell infiltration and activity and significantly reduces tumour immunosuppressive factors. Their liposomal combination reduces the growth of various murine tumours, including subcutaneous, orthotopic, and lung metastasis tumours, and offers a long-term immunological memory function against tumour rechallenging.

"Microenvironment-responsive drug delivery systems (DDSs) can achieve targeted drug delivery, reduce drug side effects and improve drug efficacies. Among them, pH-responsive DDSs have gained popularity since the pH in the diseased tissues such as cancer, bacterial infection and inflammation differs from a physiological pH of 7.4 and this difference could be harnessed for DDSs to release encapsulated drugs specifically to these diseased tissues. A variety of synthetic approaches have been developed to prepare pH-sensitive DDSs, including introduction of a variety of pH-sensitive chemical bonds or protonated/deprotonated chemical groups. A myriad of nano DDSs have been explored to be pH-responsive, including liposomes, micelles, hydrogels, dendritic macromolecules and organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles, and micron level microspheres. The prodrugs from drug-loaded pH-sensitive nano DDSs have been applied in research on anticancer therapy and diagnosis of cancer, inflammation, antibacterial infection, and neurological diseases. We have systematically summarized synthesis strategies of pH-stimulating DDSs, illustrated commonly used and recently developed nanocarriers for these DDSs and covered their potential in different biomedical applications, which may spark new ideas for the development and application of pH-sensitive nano DDSs."
"Transdermal drug delivery exhibited encouraging prospects, especially through superficial drug administration routes. However, only a few limited lipophilic drug molecules could cross the skin barrier, those are with low molecular weight and rational Log P value. Microneedles (MNs) can overcome these limitations to deliver numerous drugs into the dermal layer by piercing the outermost skin layer of the body. In the case of superficial cancer treatments, topical drug administration faces severely low transfer efficiency, and systemic treatments are always associated with side effects and premature drug degradation. MN-based systems have achieved excellent technical capabilities and been tested for pre-clinical chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and immunotherapy. In this review, we will focus on the features, progress, and opportunities of MNs in the anticancer drug delivery system. Then, we will discuss the strategies and advantages in these works and summarize challenges, perspectives, and translational potential for future applications."
"ene (PE) and polyethylene-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PE-PEG) grafted with N,N,N‘,N‘-tetraethyldiethylenetriamine (TEDETA) were used as soluble and recoverable supports for copper bromide mediated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of methyl methacrylate (MMA). The PE chain length and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacer strongly affected the catalytic activity and control of the polymerization. With PE as a catalyst support, the catalytic activity and control of the polymerization were low and decreased as the PE support's chain length increased. The adverse effects of the PE support were minimized by using PEG as spacer to graft the catalyst onto the PE support. The PE25-PEG4-TEDETA-CuBr and PE16-PEG10-TEDETA-CuBr were found effectively mediated ATRP of MMA. The recycled PE-supported catalysts had low activity because of catalyst side reactions and/or catalyst loss, but the PE25-PEG4-TEDETA-CuBr retained 90% activity upon recycling and had good control over the polymerization."
"vantage of the highly permeable vasculature and lack of lymphatic drainage in solid tumors (EPR effect), nanosized drug delivery systems or nanomedicines have been extensively explored for tumor-targeted drug delivery. However, in most clinical cases tumors such as the early stage tumors and post-surgery microscopic residual tumors have not yet developed such pathological EPR features, i.e., EPR-deficient. Therefore, nanomedicines may not be applicable for such these tumors. Macrophages by nature can actively home and extravasate through the tight vascular wall into tumors and migrate to their hypoxic regions, and possess perfect stealth ability for long blood circulation and impressive phagocytosis for drug loadings. Thus, nanomedicines loaded in macrophages would harness both merits and gain the active tumor homing capability independent of the EPR effect for treatments of the EPR-deficient tumors. Herein, the critical considerations, current progress, challenges and future prospects of macrophages as carriers for nanomedicines are summarized, aiming at rational design of EPR-independent tumor-targeting active nanomedicines for targeted early and adjuvant cancer chemotherapy."

"in 12 (IL12) is a potent pro‐inflammatory chemokine with multifunction, including promoting cytotoxic T‐cell‐mediated killing of cancer cells. IL12‐based cancer gene therapy can overcome IL12's life‐threatening adverse effects, but its clinical translation has been limited by the lack of systemic gene‐delivery vectors capable of efficiently transfecting tumors to produce sufficient local IL12. Macrophages inherently excrete IL12, and tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) are the major tumor component taking up a large fraction of the vectors arriving in the tumor. It is thus hypothesized that a gene vector efficiently transfecting both cancer cells and TAMs would make the tumor to produce sufficient IL12; however, gene transfection of TAMs is challenging due to their inherent strong degradation ability. Herein, an IL12 gene‐delivery vector is designed that efficiently transfects both cancer cells and TAMs to make them as a factory for IL12 production, which efficiently activates anticancer immune responses and remodels the tumor microenvironment, for instance, increasing the M1/M2 ratio by more than fourfold. Therefore, the intravenously administered vector retards tumor growth and doubles survival in three animal models’ with negligible systemic toxicities. This work reports the first nonviral IL12 gene delivery system that effectively makes use of both macrophages and tumor cells."
"ed cationic polymers have been extensively explored as nonviral carriers for gene delivery, but inefficient intracellular unpacking of polymer/DNA complexes (polyplexes) to release plasmids is still a key limiting step to high transfection efficiency. Furthermore, the amine‐resulting cationic charges in the polymer chains, and even their degraded fragments, inherently interfere with transgene expression. A cationic polymer capable of converting to uncharged fragments once inside cells would not only quickly release the DNA, but also not interfere with the gene transcription process for efficient gene expression and low toxicity. A new class of polysulfoniums that can degrade into neutral thioether fragments triggered by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is reported. The polysulfoniums condense DNA into nanosized polyplexes, which can be quickly internalized and efficiently escape from endo/lysosomes. In cancer cells, the oxidation of the boronic acid/ester by the elevated ROS levels triggers polysulfonium to break down into neutral thioether fragments, efficiently releasing DNA for gene expression. More importantly, the polyplexes have excellent serum resistance; in vivo, they efficiently deliver the suicide gene pTRAIL to intraperitoneal tumors eliciting effective anticancer activity."
"ear-infrared (NIR) nanomaterials provide a unique opportunity for applications in bioimaging and medical diagnosis. A kind of hydrophilic NIR fluorescent core–shell structured silica nanoparticle containing NIR cyanine chromophore, named as CyN-12@NHs, for in vivo bioimaging is developed through a facile one-pot strategy. The hydrophobic CyN-12 molecules can be successfully encapsulated into the core via the self-assembly of the amphiphilic block copolymer PS-b-PAA and subsequent shell cross-linking of silane. The as-prepared CyN-12@NHs exhibits typically spherical core–shell structure, which has a uniform size of 35 nm with a narrow size distribution, and excellent dispersity in aqueous solution. Moreover, NIR absorption (690 nm) and bright fluorescence (800 nm) of CyN-12@NHs with a large Stokes shift (110 nm) in aqueous system make it an amenable high quality bioimaging contrast agent. The core–shell nanostructure significantly enhances the chemical and photo-stability of CyN-12 via the encapsulation, which possesses a 50-times longer half-life period than free CyN-12, along with a better resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, in living cell imaging, CyN-12@NHs shows nearly no cytotoxicity and is able to outline the HepG2 cells. The in vivo imaging on a tumor-bearing mouse model indicates that CyN-12@NHs selectively accumulates in the liver after intravenous injection, and has a long retention in tumor after intra-tumor injection without decrease in fluorescence activity. Overall, the excellent photo-properties of CyN-12@NHs could meet the intricate requirements for tumor imaging, such as high sensitivity, sufficient tissue penetration, and high spatial resolution. The strategy of the silica–cyanine hybrid nanoparticles paves a desirable and efficient route to fabricate highly hydrophilic NIR fluorescent contrast agents for tumor imaging and therapy, especially with a breakthrough in photo-stability, bright fluorescence as well as large Stokes shift."
"n-metal-mediated living radical polymerizations (atom transfer radical polymerization, ATRP) have many potential applications, but the high concentration of residual catalyst colors their products. Supporting catalyst on insoluble solids has been used to reduce the content of residual catalyst and to reuse the catalyst, but the ability of the supported catalyst to mediate a polymerization is substantially reduced due to heterogeneity. Here we report a soluble but recoverable catalyst support for ATRP. Poly(ethylene)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PE-PEG) was soluble in toluene above 70 °C but insoluble at room temperature. CuBr supported on PE-PEG via tetraethyldiethylenetriamine thus mediated living polymerizations of methyl methacrylate, 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate, and styrene as homogeneous catalyst at 80 or 100 °C, producing polymers with well-controlled molecular weight and very low polydispersity. The catalyst recycled at ambient temperature retained high activity and still mediated ..."

"s of 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) were synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization using ethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate as the initiator, Cu(I)Br as the catalyst, and 1,1,4,7,10,10-hexamethyltriethylene tetramine as the ligand. At low crosslinker levels, the polymerizations followed the first-order kinetics. However, when the crosslinker level was above 10 mol %, the ln([M] 0 /[M]) versus time curves showed deceleration at medium conversions because of the higher reactivity of EGDMA than that of DMAEMA. An acceleration at high conversions was also observed and probably caused by the diffusion limitations of catalyst/ligand complex in the polymer network. The hydrogels were characterized by swelling experiments, and the sol polymers were characterized by the size exclusion chromatographic technique to determine the number-average molecular weight and polydispersity. The gel data were analyzed and, via a comparison to Flory's gelation theory, found to be more homogeneous than similar hydrogels prepared by conventional free-radical polymerization methods."
"nates were synthesized by ring-opening copolymerizations of trimethylene carbonate (TMC) with 1,2-O-isopropylidene-d-xylofuranose-3,5-cyclic carbonate (IPXTC). Subsequent deprotection of the ketal protecting groups gave controlled quantities of vicinal diol pendant groups. Studies of TMC/IPXTC copolymerization showed that MAO and ZnEt2−0.5H2O were the preferred catalysts. The reactivity ratios measured by the Fineman−Ross method and using ZnEt2−0.5H2O as the catalyst were 0.31 and 0.20 for IPXTC and TMC, respectively. Hence, even though IPXTC has bulky substituents, IPXTC was more reactive than TMC early in the copolymerization. Consistent with the above, the average IPXTC chain segment length was longer early in the copolymerization but decreased with increased conversion. 1H and 13C NMR were used to analyze the repeat unit sequence distribution of copolymers. For copolymers with high IPXTC contents, three types of IPXTC linkages were found:  head−head, tail−tail, and head−tail. The protecting k..."
"The emergence of nanomaterials for drug delivery provides the opportunity to avoid the side effects of systemic drug administration and injury caused by the removal of tumors, delivering great promise for future cancer treatments. However, the efficacy of current nano drugs is not significantly better than that of the original drug treatments. The important reason is that nano drugs enter the tumor vasculature, remaining close to the blood vessels and unable to enter the tumor tissue or tumor cells to complete the drug delivery process. The low efficiency of drug penetration into tumors has become a bottleneck restricting the development of nano-drugs. Herein, we present a systematic overview of recent advances on the design of nano-drug carriers in drug delivery systems for enhancing drug penetration into tumors. The review is organized into four sections: The drug penetration process in tumor tissue includes paracellular and transcellular transport, which is summarized first. Strategies that promote tumor penetration are then introduced, including methods of remodeling the tumor microenvironment, charge inversion, dimensional change, and surface modification of ligands which promote tissue penetration. Conclusion and the prospects for the future development of drug penetration are finally briefly illustrated. The review is intended to provide thoughts for effective treatment of cancer by summarizing strategies for promoting the endocytosis of nano drugs into tumor cells."
"The structural perfection and multivalency of dendrimers have made them useful for biodelivery and bioactivity via peripheral functionalization and the modulation of core-forming structures and dendrimer generations. Yet only few dendrimers have shown inherent therapeutic activity arising from their inner repeating units. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of a polyacylthiourea dendrimer with inherent potent anticancer activity and the absence of cytotoxicity in mice. The poly(ethylene glycol)-functionalized fourth generation of the dendrimer, which can be efficiently synthesized from sequential click reactions of orthogonal monomers, displays low in vivo acute and subacute toxicities yet potently inhibits tumour growth and metastasis. The dendrimer's in vivo anticancer activity arises from the depletion of bioavailable copper and the subsequent inhibition of angiogenesis and cellular proliferation. When compared with some clinically used cytotoxin drugs, the dendrimer exerts inherent anticancer activity via non-cytotoxic pathways and leads to higher therapeutic efficacy, yet without cytotoxin-induced side effects."
" microenvironment (TME), including intracellular and extracellular microenvironment, contains many biochemical indicators (such as acidity/alkalinity, oxygen content, and enzymatic activity) that are different from the normal physiological environment. These abnormal biochemical indicators can accelerate the heterogeneity of tumors, but on the other hand, they also provide opportunities for the design of intelligent drug delivery systems (DDSs). The TME‐responsive DDSs have shown great potential in reducing the side effects of chemotherapy and improving the curative effect of tumors. In this review, the abnormal biochemical indicators of TME are introduced in detail from both the extracellular and intracellular aspects. In view of the various physiological barriers encountered during drug delivery, the strategy of constructing TME‐responsive DDSs is discussed. By summarizing the typical research progress, the authors prospect the development of TME‐responsive DDS in the future."
"A new type of tumor-targeted nanovehicle peptide-conjugated PSPG (PSPGP) is successfully synthesized for co-delivery of paclitaxel (PTX) and TR3 small interfering RNA (siRNA). In vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that the redox-responsive PSPGP exhibit enhanced endosomal escape and intracellular degradation, which facilitate PTX and TR3 siRNA release, effectively improving the antitumor efficacy."

"sorption experiments up to 180 bar and 75 °C, the CO2 solubility in an ammonium-type ionic polymer, such as poly(p-vinylbenzyltrimethyl ammonium tetrafluoroborate), is found to be much higher than that in an imidazolium-type ionic polymer, such as poly(1-(p-vinylbenzyl)-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate), which points to a cation-type effect on the CO2 sorption in polymerized ionic liquids. These two polymers remain glassy in the temperature and pressure ranges studied in this work. The CO2 solubility increases with decreasing temperature and with increasing pressure, but it reaches a limiting value, beyond which it is insensitive to pressure."
"s has been reported to improve the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and may be a strategy to enhance osteosarcoma treatment. The extent to which modulation of mitochondria could induce tumor pyroptosis to enhance immunotherapy has not been characterized. We synthesized a mitochondria-targeting polymer micelle (OPDEA-PDCA), in which poly[2-(N-oxide-N,N-diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (OPDEA) was used to target mitochondria and the conjugated dichloroacetate (DCA) was used to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1). This conjugate induced pyroptosis through initiation of mitochondrial oxidative stress. We found that OPDEA-PDCA targeted mitochondria and induced mitochondrial oxidative stress through the inhibition of PDHK1, resulting in immunogenic pyroptosis in osteosarcoma cell lines. Moreover, we showed that OPDEA-PDCA could induce secretion of soluble programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) molecule. Therefore, combined therapy with OPDEA-PDCA and an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody significantly suppressed proliferation of osteosarcoma with prolonged T cell activation. This study provided a strategy to initiate pyroptosis through targeted modulation of mitochondria, which may promote enhanced antitumor efficacy in combination with immunotherapy."
"ministrable anticancer nanomedicines are highly desirable due to their easy and repeatable administration, but are not yet feasible because the current nanomedicine cannot simultaneously overcome the strong mucus and villi barriers and thus have very low bioavailability (BA). Herein, this work presents the first polymeric micelle capable of fast mucus permeation and villi absorption and delivering paclitaxel (PTX) efficiently to tumors with therapeutic efficacy even better than intravenously administered polyethylene glycol based counterpart or free PTX. Poly[2‐(N‐oxide‐N,N‐diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (OPDEA), a water‐soluble polyzwitterion, is highly nonfouling to proteins and other biomacromolecules such as mucin but can weakly bind to phospholipids. Therefore, the micelle of its block copolymer with poly(ε‐caprolactone) (OPDEA‐PCL) can efficiently permeate through the viscous mucus and bind to villi, which triggers transcytosis‐mediated transepithelial transport into blood circulation for tumor accumulation. The orally administered micelles deliver PTX to tumors, efficiently inhibiting the growth of HepG2 and patient‐derived hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts and triple‐negative breast tumors. These results demonstrate that OPDEA‐based micelles may serve as an efficient oral nanomedicine for delivering other small molecules or even large molecules."
"ellulose fiber‐based materials have been widely used in daily life for a broad application owing to their intrinsic merits such as easy availability, eco‐friendly, good processability, and outstanding physical–mechanical properties. Surface modification of natural fibers with nanostructures is an effective strategy to integrate the textile substrates with many favorable functionalities. Here, a green, facile, and universal method is introduced for the in situ growth of γ‐cyclodextrin (γ‐CD) metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) in cellulose fiber‐based materials (CelluMOFs). Compared to the pristine fibers, the resulting CelluMOFs have high porosity with up to 50 times larger specific surface area and enhanced loading capacity to functional molecules (essential oils, antibacterial agents, and active drugs) with 23–36 times higher loading content. The CelluMOFs also exhibit high adsorption capability to volatile organic compounds and carbon dioxide. Moreover, the CelluMOFs textiles loaded with a model drug (doxorubicin) show a steady release profile and deep skin permeation capability. These CelluMOFs combine the advantages of both cellulose fibers and CD‐MOFs, which greatly extend their applications in the fragrance industry, antimicrobial, pollutant removal, and biomedical textiles."
"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold great promise in the field of regenerative medicine, and great effort goes into investigating the mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects. These investigations necessitate the development of sensitive and reliable methods of tracking stem cells. As the unique physicochemical properties of β-NaGdF4:Yb/Er upconversion nanoparticles make them highly efficient fluorescent probes, they could be utilized to track stem cells through bio-imaging. However, their biocompatibility constitutes a major challenge to their use in biomedical applications. In this paper, we prepared ligand-free spherical β- NaGdF4:Yb/Er nanoparticles of two different sizes (~15 and ~30 nm in diameter) and investigated their internalization into rat bone marrow-derived MSCs (rBMSCs), as well as their effects on cell proliferation, osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. Even though particles of both sizes were efficiently taken up by the cells, the larger particles had a stronger fluorescence intensity but their proliferation was not significantly affected; this makes them superior for cell imaging. Analysis of multiple markers revealed that the nanoparticles, especially the larger ones, promoted the process of osteogenic differentiation. In contrast, adipogenesis was slightly hindered by the larger particles, whereas the smaller ones did not affect the process. As a whole, this study suggests that ligand-free spherical β-NaGdF4:Yb/Er particles of appropriate size are compatible with stem cell proliferation and differentiation, which makes them promising agents for biomedical applications."
"Poly(β-aminoester) dendrimers have been prepared. These systems represent the first degradable dual pH- and temperature-responsive dendrimers displaying photoluminescence. The pH/temperature sensitivities are interrelated; the lower critical solution temperature of the dendrimer decreases as the pH of the solution is increased. The sensitivities are mainly due to phase changes of the surface groups with changes in pH or temperature. These dual-responsive dendrimers are very useful in drug delivery. They may be loaded with a hydrophobic drug at low temperature without using organic solvents. The loaded drug is released very slowly and steadily at 37 °C and physiological pH, but can be quickly released at acidic pH, for example the lysosomal pH (pH 4-5), for intracellular drug release. These dendrimers also display strong photoluminescence, which can be exploited for monitoring drug loading and release. Thus, poly(β-aminoester) dendrimers constitute ideal drug carriers since their thermal sensitivity allows the loading of drugs without using organic solvents, their pH sensitivity permits fast intracellular drug release, and their photoluminescence provides a means of monitoring drug loading and release."

"Nanoformulations have been extensively explored to deliver water-insoluble drugs, but they generally use exotic new materials, for instance, amphiphilic block copolymers, which must first go through extensively clinical trials and be approved as drug excipients before any clinical uses. We hypothesize that using clinical amphiphilic drugs as surfactants to self-assemble with and thus solubilize hydrophobic drugs will lead to readily translational nanoformulations as they contain no new excipients. Herein, we show the first example of such excipient-free nanodispersions using an amphiphilic anti-tumor drug, irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT11). CPT11 self-assembles with its insoluble active parent drug, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy camptothecin (SN38), into stable and water-dispersible nanoparticles, increasing SN38's water solubility by thousands of times up to 25 mg/mL with a loading efficiency close to 100%. The versatility of this approach is also demonstrated by fabricating nanodispersions of CPT11 with other water-insoluble drugs including paclitaxel (PTX) and camptothecin (CPT). These nanodispersions have much increased bioavailability and thereby improved anti-cancer activities. Thus, this strategy, using clinically proven amphiphilic drugs as excipients to fabricate nanodispersions, avoids new materials and makes readily translational nanoformulations of hydrophobic drugs."

"The concept of initiators for continuous activator regeneration (ICAR) in atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is introduced, whereby a constant source of organic free radicals works to regenerate the Cu(I) activator, which is otherwise consumed in termination reactions when used at very low concentrations. With this technique, controlled synthesis of polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) (Mw/Mn < 1.2) can be implemented with catalyst concentrations between 10 and 50 ppm, where its removal or recycling would be unwarranted for many applications. Additionally, various organic reducing agents (derivatives of hydrazine and phenol) are used to continuously regenerate the Cu(I) activator in activators regenerated by electron transfer (ARGET) ATRP. Controlled polymer synthesis of acrylates (Mw/Mn < 1.2) is realized with catalyst concentrations as low as 50 ppm. The rational selection of suitable Cu complexing ligands {tris[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine (Me6TREN) and tris[(2-pyridyl)methyl]amine (TPMA)} is discussed in regards to specific side reactions in each technique (i.e., complex dissociation, acid evolution, and reducing agent complexation). Additionally, mechanistic studies and kinetic modeling are used to optimize each system. The performance of the selected catalysts/reducing agents in homo and block (co)polymerizations is evaluated."
"Chitosan has been used as a scaffolding material in tissue engineering due to its mechanical properties and biocompatibility. With increased appreciation of the effect of micro- and nanoscale environments on cellular behavior, there is increased emphasis on generating microfabricated chitosan structures. Here we employed a microfluidic coaxial flow-focusing system to generate cell adhesive chitosan microtubes of controlled sizes by modifying the flow rates of a chitosan pre-polymer solution and phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The microtubes were extruded from a glass capillary with a 300 μm inner diameter. After ionic crosslinking with sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP), fabricated microtubes had inner and outer diameter ranges of 70-150 μm and 120-185 μm. Computational simulation validated the controlled size of microtubes and cell attachment. To enhance cell adhesiveness on the microtubes, we mixed gelatin with the chitosan pre-polymer solution. During the fabrication of microtubes, fibroblasts suspended in core PBS flow adhered to the inner surface of chitosan-gelatin microtubes. To achieve physiological pH values, we adjusted pH values of chiotsan pre-polymer solution and TPP. In particular, we were able to improve cell viability to 92 % with pH values of 5.8 and 7.4 for chitosan and TPP solution respectively. Cell culturing for three days showed that the addition of the gelatin enhanced cell spreading and proliferation inside the chitosan-gelatin microtubes. The microfluidic fabrication method for ionically crosslinked chitosan microtubes at physiological pH can be compatible with a variety of cells and used as a versatile platform for microengineered tissue engineering."
"ogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) commonly leads to therapeutic failure of HCC. Cytokeratin 19 (CK19) is well acknowledged as a biliary/progenitor cell marker and a marker of tumor stem cell. CK19-positive HCCs demonstrate aggressive behaviors and poor outcomes which including worse overall survival and early tumor recurrence after hepatectomy and liver transplantation. CK19-positive HCCs are resistant to chemotherapies as well as local treatment. This subset of HCC is thought to derive from liver progenitor cells and can be induced by extracellular stimulation such as hypoxia. Besides being a stemness marker, CK19 plays an important role in promoting malignant property of HCC. The regulatory network associated with CK19 expression has been summarized that extracellular stimulations which transmit into cytoplasm through signal transduction pathways (TGF-β, MAKP/JNK and MEK-ERK1/2), further induce important nuclear transcriptional factors (SALL4, AP1, SP1) to activate CK19 promoter. Novel noncoding RNAs are also involved in the regulation of CK19 expression. TGFβR1 becomes a therapeutic target for CK19-positive HCC. In conclusion, CK19 can be a potential biomarker for predicting poor prognosis after surgical and adjuvant therapies. CK19-pisitive HCCs exhibit distinctive molecular profiling, should be diagnosed and treated as a separate subtype of HCCs."

"rug conjugates are prodrugs that have the advantages of precise molecular structure and the direct exploitation of tumor‐homing, penetration or the cellular uptake abilities of the peptides such as the neuropilin‐1 receptor targeting peptide. The prodrugs generally have fast blood clearance due to their low molecular weights and thus are made to self‐assemble into nanostructures, preferably nanosized micelles and vesicles for intravenous administration, to slow their renal clearance. However, most peptidyl prodrugs usually form precipitates, irregular nanofibers or gels that are unsuitable for intravenous injection. Herein, a arginine‐glycine‐aspartic acid‐lysine (RGDK) peptide and cytotoxin 7‐ethyl‐10‐hydroxycamptothecin (SN38) are used to synthesize the tumor‐homing prodrugs (SN38‐Peps) and explore their structure–micelle formation relationships. A small library of SN38‐Peps is obtained using different structures of peptides, linkers, and drug conjugation sites, and the factors affecting the assembly of SN38‐Peps as well as the stability of formed micelles are investigated. An optimized SN38‐Pep, (MOM)SN38(20)‐CRGDK, is finally obtained which forms stable micelles with a hydrodynamic diameter around 110 nm and a fixed drug loading content as high as 35%. The micelles show a prolonged blood circulation, significantly enhanced tumor accumulation, and therefore improved anticancer activity as compared to the non‐targeting prodrug and a clinically used anticancer drug."
"Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent materials are considered to be the most promising labeling reagents for sensitive determination and biological imaging due to the advantages of lower background noise, deeper penetrating capacity, and less destructive effects on the biomatrix over those of UV and visible fluorophores. In the past decade, advances in biomedical fluorescence imaging in the NIR region have focused on the traditional NIR window (NIR-I; λ=700-900 nm), and have recently been extended to the second NIR window (NIR-II; λ=1000-1700 nm). In vivo NIR-II fluorescence imaging outperforms imaging in the NIR-I window as a result of further reduced absorption, tissue autofluorescence, and scattering. In this review, the applications of four types of NIR-II fluorescent materials, organic fluorophores, quantum dots, rare-earth compounds, and single-walled carbon nanotubes, are summarized and future trends are discussed. Some methods to enhance the NIR-II fluorescence quantum yield are also proposed."
"Amphiphilic drug conjugates can self-assemble into nanovehicles for cancer drug delivery, but the key is to design stable yet intracellular labile drug linkers for drug retention during blood circulation but fast intracellular drug release. The conjugation of paclitaxel (PTX) is generally via the ester of its 2'-hydroxyl group, but the ester is either too stable to release PTX in the cytosol or so labile that hydrolyzes during circulation. Herein, we report a p-(boronic ester)benzyl-based tumor-specifically cleavable linker for preparing PTX-conjugate with polyethylene glycol (PEG, Mw = 5000 Da) (PEG-B-PTX). The amphiphilic PEG-B-PTX self-assembled into micelle with an average size of ~50 nm and a PTX loading content of 13.3 wt%. The PEG-B-PTX micelles were very stable at the normal physiological environment and thus circulated long in the blood compartment, but fast dissociated and released PTX in response to the elevated reactive‑oxygen species (ROS) level in tumors. The conjugate micelles showed significantly improved antitumor efficiency in vitro and in vivo against human glioma and breast cancer cells, and reduced toxicity compared to the clinically used Taxol. Thus, the PTX-conjugate micelles were characteristic of well-characterized chemical structure and nanostructure, precise and reproducible drug loading efficiency (i.e., 100%) and fixed loading content, high PTX loading content due to PTX itself as part of the carrier, no burst drug release, and easy and reproducible fabrication of the micelles, which are all essential for clinical translation."
" gel supported CuBr-hexamethyltriethylenetetramine (HMTETA) (SG-CuBr/HMTETA) catalyst system was developed for the synthesis of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (polyDMAEMA) macromonomers with terminal vinyl or allyl group by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Catalysed by SG-CuBr/HMTETA and with vinyloxyethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate (VBIB) or allyl 2-bromoisobutyrate (ABIB) as initiator, the MMA polymerization showed first order kinetics up to a 60% monomer conversion. The polymerization rate slowed down at higher conversions due to a reduction in radical concentration. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results showed that the decrease in radical concentration was caused by the reaction of radicals with the initiator's vinyl or ally group moieties. In contrast, the DMAEMA polymerization was first order kinetics throughout the polymerization. The molecular weights of the resulting PMMA and polyDMAEMA increased linearly with conversion with low polydispersities. After the first run polymerization, the catalysts were recycled for second and thrid runs. The recycled catalysts still mediated a living polymerization of MMA or DMAEMA, producing polymers with controlled molecular weight and narrow polydispersity, but their catalytic activities decreased significantly. The reactivity reduction of the recycled catalyst was due to radical side reactions that yielded an extra amount of CuBr 2 as well as the catalyst loss during recycling."

"Gene therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in many genetic diseases, as evidenced by recent clinical applications. Viral vectors have been extensively tested in clinical gene-therapy trials, but nonviral vectors such as cationic polymers or lipids are much less used due to their lower gene-transfection efficiencies. However, the advantages of nonviral vectors, such as easily tailored structures, nonimmunogenetics, and relatively low cost, still drive great efforts to improve their transfection efficiencies. A reverse question asks if nonviral vectors with current gene transfection efficiency can find application niches. Herein, we synthesized a cationic polymer, poly{ N-[2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl]- N-[ p-acetyloxyphenyl]- N, N-diethylammonium chloride} (PQDEA), as a gene-delivery carrier and compared it side by side with chemotherapy drugs for cancer treatment. PQDEA is rapidly hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases into anionic poly(acrylic acid) to give low cytotoxicity and fast release of DNA for expression. PQDEA formed stable complexes with DNA (PQDEA/DNA polyplexes), which were further coated with a lipid layer to make serum-stable lipidic polyplexes, LPQDEA/DNAs, for in vivo use. In an intraperitoneal tumor xenograft model mimicking late-stage metastatic cervical cancer, the LPQDEA/DNA vector with TRAIL suicide gene exerted strong tumor inhibition as effective as paclitaxel, the first-line anticancer drug, but gave much less tumor relapse and much longer survival than the clinical chemotherapy drugs, irinotecan and paclitaxel. Equally important, the gene therapy showed much fewer adverse effects than the chemotherapy drugs. This work shows that nonviral vectors with current transfection efficiencies may produce therapeutic advantages and may be safe and worthy of clinical translation in, for example, intraperitoneal cancer therapy."
"sfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is a very useful living/controlled radical polymerization process for polymer synthesis, but its products are contaminated with transition metal catalyst residue. Catalyst immobilization on solids via covalent binding has the advantages of easy catalyst separation and reuse, but it deteriorates the control of the polymerization due to the slowed radical deactivation, which causes chain termination and uncontrolled propagation. In this paper, we report a reversible catalyst supporting concept via hydrogen-bonding-mediated self-assembly. The support acts as a “catalyst sponge” releasing the catalyst as free molecules at elevated temperatures for effective catalysis but absorbing the catalyst after the polymerization for separation. The support was polystyrene gel functionalized with maleimide or thymine units, and the catalyst was tethered on a diaminopyridine unit. A triple hydrogen bond array formed between maleimide or thymine and diaminopyridine at room temper..."
"h alkoxides are highly active initiators for ring opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone in CCl4. The molecular weight of the polymer obtained can be as high as 1.8×105 (Mv) at 60°C in an hour. The influence of solvent, rare earth element, ligand, monomer, and catalyst concentration, as well as the polymerization temperature and time was investigated. A mechanism study by IR, UV, and 1H NMR spectra showed that the polymerization of ε-caprolactone catalyzed by rare earth alkoxides proceeds through a “coordination-insertion” mechanism and selective cleavage of acyl–oxygen bonds of the monomer."
"on of muscle‐like actuation for a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) requires mesogen alignment, which is typically achieved/fixed chemically during the synthesis. Post‐synthesis regulation of the alignment in a convenient and repeatable manner is highly desirable yet challenging. Here, a dual‐phase LCE network is designed and synthesized with a crystalline melting transition above a liquid crystalline transition. The crystalline phase can serve as an “alignment frame” to fix any mechanical deformation via a shape memory mechanism, leading to corresponding mesogen alignment in the liquid crystalline phase. The alignment can be erased by melting, which can be the starting point for reprogramming. This strategy that relies on a physical shape memory transition for mesogen alignment permits repeated reprogramming in a timescale of seconds, in stark contrast to typical methods. It further leads to unusual versatility in designing 3D printed LCE with unlimited programmable actuation modes."
"A facile novel approach of introducing dopamine and [2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide via dopamine-triggered in situ synthesis into gelatin hydrogels in the presence of ZnSO4 is presented in this study. Remarkably, the resulting hydrogels showed 99.99 and 100% antibacterial efficiency against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively, making them the highest performing surfaces in their class. Furthermore, the hydrogels showed adhesive properties, self-healing ability, antifreeze properties, electrical conductivity, fatigue resistance, and mechanical stability from -100 to 80 °C. The added multifunctional performance overcomes several disadvantages of gelatin-based hydrogels such as poor mechanical properties and limited thermostability. Overall, the newly developed hydrogels show significant potential for numerous biomedical applications, such as wearable monitoring sensors and antibacterial coatings."

"Synthetic protein-level circuits offer an extra layer of cellular control on top of conventional gene-level circuits. Here, we describe a technology that allows conditional protein rescue (CPR) from proteasomal degradation using different protein inputs as masking agents. A target protein is fused to a degron tag and an affinity sensor domain. The use of nanobodies as the sensor domain offers a generalizable strategy to execute a wide range of protein-level circuits with ease. The utility of this new strategy was successfully demonstrated to distinguish cancer cells out of a healthy population using the HPV-specific E7 protein as a cellular marker. Because CPR can be programmed to execute more complex Boolean logic designs using cell-specific proteomes, this platform offers a highly modular and scalable framework for a wide range of applications based on synthetic protein circuits."
"Chemoresistance remains a formidable hurdle against cancer therapy. Seeking for novel therapy strategies is an urgent need for those who no longer benefit from chemotherapy. Chemoresistance is usually associated with the dysfunction of intrinsic apoptosis. Targeting extrinsic apoptosis via TRAIL signaling and the death receptors could be a potential solution to treat chemoresistant cancer. A highly biocompatible nano system for codelivery of the TRAIL DNA and the death receptor sensitizer monensin was developed, in which low-molecular-weight PEI (LMW-PEI) was crosslinked by the sulfhydryl cyclodextrin via disulfide bonds, and then bound with DNA, thus forming the bioreducible polyplex cores. In addition, the cyclodextrin also functioned as a carrier for the hydrophobic monensin via host-guest inclusion. Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) was used to modify the polyplex core via charge interaction. The γ-PGA corona can specifically bind with the tumor-associated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) overexpressed on the tumor cells, and achieve tumor-targeting delivery. Moreover, the tumor-homing peptide RGD-modified γ-PGA was also prepared as the surface coating materials for further improving gene delivery efficiency. This gene delivery system was characterized by the dual ligand-targeting, dual stimuli-responsive features. The ligands of RGD and γ-PGA can target the tumor-associated receptors (i.e., integrin and GGT). The conformation of γ-PGA is pH-sensitive, and the tumor acidic micro environments could trigger the detachment of surface-coating γ-PGA. The disulfide crosslinking LMW-PEI is redox-sensitive, and its fast disassembling in the tumor cells could favor the efficient gene delivery. The anti-tumor efficacy was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, MYC-mediated synthetic lethality could be an important mechanism for overcoming the drug resistance. An important finding of our studies is the demonstration of the in vivo treatment efficacy of TRAIL/monensin, thus providing a potential novel therapeutic strategy for overcoming drug-resistant cancer."

"diated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is versatile for living polymerizations of a wide range of monomers, but ATRP of vinyl acetate (VAc) remains challenging due to the low homolytic cleavage activity of the carbon-halide bond of the dormant poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) chains and the high reactivity of growing PVAc radicals. Therefore, all the reported highly active copper-based catalysts are inactive in ATRP of VAc. Herein, we report the first copper-catalyst mediated ATRP of VAc using CuBr/2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine (tPy) or CuCl/tPy as catalysts. The polymerization was a first order reaction with respect to the monomer concentration. The molecular weights of the resulting PVAc linearly increased with the VAc conversion. The living character was further proven by self-chain extension of PVAc. Using polystyrene (PS) as a macroinitiator, a well-defined diblock copolymer PS-b-PVAc was prepared. Hydrolysis of the PS-b-PVAc produced a PS-b-poly(vinyl alcohol) amphiphilic diblock copolymer. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2009"
"ines have been extensively explored for cancer treatment, and their efficacies have arguably been proven in various cancer cell-derived xenograft (CDX) mouse models. However, they generally fail to show such therapeutic advantages in patients because of the huge pathological differences between human tumors and CDX models. Methods: In this study, we fabricated colloidal ultrastable nanomedicines from polymeric prodrugs and compared the therapeutic efficacies in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) CDX and clinically relevant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models, which closely mimic human tumor pathological properties. Working towards this goal, we esterified a highly potent SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) agent using oligo- or polylactide (oLA or PLA) segments with varying molecular weights. Results: The resulting SN38 conjugates assembled with polyethylene glycol-block-polylactic acid to form systemically injectable nanomedicines. With increasing PLA chain length, the SN38 conjugates showed extended retention in the nanoparticles and superior antitumor activity, completely eradicating xenografted tumors in both mouse models. Our data implicate that these small-sized and ultrastable nanomedicines might also efficaciously treat cancer in patients. More interestingly, the systemically delivered nanomedicines notably alleviated the incidence of bloody diarrhea. Conclusion: Our studies demonstrate that the appropriate molecular editing of anticancer drugs enables the generation of better tolerated cytotoxic nanotherapy for cancer, which represents a potentially useful scaffold for further clinical translation."
"polymer polyethyleneimine (PEI) can carry DNA across the cell membrane and enter the nucleus, and thus can be a very useful carrier for nuclear drug delivery; however, its highly positive charges make it toxic and not applicable for systemic drug delivery. Here, well-defined linear PEI (Mn = 1000 or 1500 or 2000)-block-polycaprolactone (Mn = 2000) (LPEI–PCL) was synthesized and used to fabricate a pH-triggered charge-reversal nanoparticle to solve this problem. LPEI's secondary amines are amidized as acid-labile β-carboxylic amides (LPEI/amide–PCL). LPEI/amide–PCL formed negatively charged nanoparticles with very low toxicity and low interaction with cells. Once in an acidic environment, the amides hydrolyze to regenerate the amine groups, producing LPEI–PCL nanoparticles carrying cationic charges. The LPEI–PCL escapes from the lysosomes and traverses into the nucleus. Folic-acid targeting groups are introduced to render the nanoparticles cancer-cell targeting capability. The nanoparticles efficiently enter folate-receptor overexpressing cancer cells and traverse to their nuclei. The DOX loaded in the carrier shows much improved cytotoxicity to cancer cells."
"In the present study, we have developed a green, facile, eco-friendly and cost-effective approach for the synthesis of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) from copper salt (CuCl) solution by using Camelia sinensis leaf extract. The biomolecules present in C. sinensis leaves extract were responsible for the reduction and stabilization of CuNPs. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by using FT-IR, SEM, TEM and EDX analysis. FT-IR analysis was used to ratify the presence of biomolecules in C. sinensis leaves extract, while SEM and TEM analysis showed that the synthesized nanoparticles are in agglomerated form and having an average size of 60 ± 6 nm. The percentage weight of synthesized nanoparticles was measured through EDX analysis. Moreover, the photocatalytic degradation of synthesized CuNPs was also evaluated by using bromophenol blue (BPB) dye under sunlight irradiation. The maximum photo-degradation of BPB dye was up to 83.7%. UV-Vis spectral analysis of CuNPs proved them as an efficient photocatalyst in dye degradation."
"Given the various cationic polymers developed as non-viral gene delivery vectors, polyethylenimine (PEI) has been/is frequently used in in vitro transfection. However, the primary drawback limiting its in vivo applications is the sharp decrease in transfection efficiency in the presence of serum. Here, we investigated the influences of serum proteins or bovine serum albumin (BSA) on the physicochemical properties of PEI/DNA complexes (polyplexes), including hydrodynamic diameters and agglomeration behavior, zeta potentials, morphologies, and sensitivity to the presence of salt. Mechanism studies revealed that the protein corona determined the endocytic rates and pathways, intracellular transport, the rate of endo/lysosomal trafficking, vesicle escape efficiency, and thus the overall gene expression levels. This work offers mechanistic insights for the serum-induced suppression of transfection efficiency, which is the reduced endo/lysosomal escape of the protein-coated polyplexes, in contrast to the protein free polyplexes."
"Polyester blending of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) with poly(D, L-lactide) (PLA) and their random copolymers (R(CL/LA)) was found to be a convenient approach to regulate the degradation and drug release behaviors of the polyesters. The blend composition and compatibility both affected its degradation and drug release behavior. A DSC study showed that PCL was compatible with 50:50 poly(CL-CO-D,L-LA) (R(50/50)) but incompatible with 25:75 poly(CL-CO-LA) (R(25/75)) and PLA homopolymer. The hydrolysis experiments indicated that with the same CL/LA segment proportion, compatible blends (PCL/R(50/50)) had higher water content and faster weight loss than incompatible blends (PCL/PLA, PCL/R(25/75)). In the compatible blends the PCL degradation rate was increased while that of R(50/50) was decreased. The controlled release kinetics, diffusion constants, and permeation coefficients of the polymer blends were measured by using northindrone (NTD) as a model. The NTD release rates from the polyester blends increased as the CL unit fraction increased but decreased with increasing the LA unit fraction in the blends. With the same CL/LA unit ratios, the NTD release rate from the compatible blend was slower than that from the incompatible blend. The NTD release from the polyester blend was controlled by the diffusion process in the early stage, but the degradation-caused NTD release was later involved. By tailoring the blend composition to such an extent that the degradation-caused release compensated the decline of the diffusion-caused release, a zero-order NTD release was achieved."
"Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-based immune checkpoint blockade therapy using the anti-PD-L1 antibody is effective for a subset of patients with advanced metastatic melanoma but about half of the patients do not respond to the therapy because of the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by cytotoxins such as doxorubicin (DOX) allows damaged dying tumor cells to release immunostimulatory danger signals to activate dendritic cells (DCs) and T-cells; however, DOX also makes tumor cells upregulate PD-L1 expression and thus deactivate T-cells via the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Herein, we show that celastrol (CEL) induced not only strong ICD but also downregulation of PD-L1 expression of tumor cells. Thus, CEL was able to simultaneously activate DCs and T-cells and interrupt the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway between T-cells and tumor cells. In a bilateral tumor model, intratumorally (i.t.) injected celastrol nanoemulsion retaining a high tumor CEL concentration activated the immune system efficiently, which inhibited both the treated tumor and the distant untreated tumor in the mice (i.e., abscopal effect). Thus, this work demonstrates a new and much cost-effective immunotherapy strategy - chemotherapy-induced immunotherapy against melanoma without the need for expensive immune-checkpoint inhibitors."
"In recent years, liposomes have been used in the field of biomedicine and have achieved many significant results. Because of the unique characteristics of liposomes, there are many materials that can be loaded in many types of liposome, such as biologically active substances. Liposomes are made of lipid bilayers, which are very similar to cell membranes. They have many biological and technical advantages and have even been used in clinical practice because of their unique structure. As liposomes have hydrophobic cavities and hydrophilic cavities, they can simultaneously load hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs. This causes an increase in the drug loading efficiency and therapeutic capability. Different therapeutic effects are achieved by different methods such as placing the biological materials in the bilayer structure of the liposome or encapsulating them in the liposome. By these methods, bio-simulated liposomes can achieve considerable cancer treatment effects. Now liposomes have become an independent platform and play an important role in many facets. In this review, we focus on the use of liposomes composed of biomaterials for the treatment of cancer. These include liposomes that mimic mammalian cells, bacteria, and viruses."
"Although much effort has been dedicated to the development of efficient siRNA delivery for cancer therapy, delivery nanomaterials that can particularly respond to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are overproduced in the tissue and mitochondria of cancer cells, are still rare for the clinical translation of RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapy. To this end, we developed a ROS-responsive boronic vehicle with a lipid envelope for systemic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) siRNA delivery so as to improve RNAi cancer therapy. We found that the efficiency of siRNA delivery largely relied on the ROS responsiveness of the carrier we have developed to mediate timely siRNA release, the PEG-functionalized lipid layer to shield the surface charge of polyplexes as well as the ability of the phenylboronic moiety to stabilize siRNA. The unique carrier nanostructure provides the efficient systemic transportation of siRNA to the tumor site for effective knockdown of the VEGF, which resulted in a significant antiangiogenesis effect and the effective inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. The current study defines a new systemic delivery strategy for siRNA by cooperatively integrating multifunctional lipid coatings with the ROS-responsive boronic polymer, which may potentially benefit RNAi-based therapy in the dawning era of precision nanomedicine for cancer therapy."
"ous tumor imaging, therapy, and pharmacokinetic monitoring can offer a safe and effective strategy for cancer therapy. This work describes the design of a fluorescence light-up nanomicelle that can afford precise imaging-guided drug delivery and pharmacokinetic monitoring in a real-time fashion for cancer chemotherapy. The nanomicelle, which contains a boron dipyrromethene based fluorescent probe as the hydrophobic core and a redox-triggered detachable poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) shell, can accumulate at the tumor site via enhanced permeation and retention effect. The PEG detachment induced by tumoral and intracellular glutathione can destabilize the nanomicelle, leading to fluorescence light up and simultaneous drug release. Importantly, the fluorescence intensities generated by the nanomicelles in different organs are well-correlated with released drug concentrations in both temporal and spatial manners, suggesting its precise role for imaging-guided drug delivery and pharmacokinetic monitoring in vivo. The tumor growth can be effectively inhibited by the docetaxel-loaded nanomicelle formulation, and the nanomicelles are monitored to be excreted via hepatobiliary routes. This nanomicelle for precise imaging-guided chemotherapy provides a safe and robust theranostic strategy for the evaluation of cancer nanomedicine."
"mor penetration has been recently recognized as a promising strategy to resolve the limitation of nanomedicine in terms of tumor penetration, but it is challenging to develop active transporting nanocarriers. Here, an ultrasonic cavitation‐assisted and acid‐activatable active transporting liposome for a broad range of tumors is reported. The active transporting liposome (size and charge dual‐conversional gemcitabine prodrug‐integrated liposomal nanodroplet (SCGLN)) overcomes the tight blood vessel walls with the aid of ultrasonic cavitation. The SCGLN subsequently transforms from micro‐size to nano‐size under prolonged ultrasound radiation. Once in the acidic tumor microenvironment, the nanosized SCGLN undergoes negative‐to‐positive charge‐reversal and triggers the cationization‐initiated transcytosis to penetrate deep into tumor parenchyma. The gemcitabine‐loaded SCGLN exhibits potent antitumor activity in multiple poorly permeable tumor models, which completely erases subcutaneous U251 glioma and stops the progression of orthotopic BxPC3 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This study presents a promising and universal strategy to develop active penetrating nanomedicines for efficient drug delivery in the low permeable tumor."
"Infections caused by pathogenic microorganisms have always been the Achilles heel in the clinic. In this work, to overcome this conundrum, we proposed an injectable multifunctional hydrogel material with outstanding antibacterial properties and self-healing properties and no adverse effects on health. The cross-linked hydrogel with three-dimensional (3D) networks was quickly formed via the dynamic Schiff base between amino-modified poly-tetrahydropyrimidine (PTHP-NH2) and multiple vanillin polymer P(DMA-VA) in 30 s. This hydrogel composite presents effective defense against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, especially for the pyogenic Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, the hydrogel showed almost no hemolysis and cytotoxicity. In vivo investigations indicated that hydrogels effectively killed S. aureus and protected against deterioration of inflammation. Besides, bioimaging of mice demonstrated that the hydrogel could be completely metabolized within 16 h. In a nutshell, given its outstanding antibacterial property and biocompatibility, the novel hydrogel could be an ideal candidate for the subcutaneous infection application."
"Most chemotherapeutic drugs and their nanomedicine formulations exert anticancer activity by inducing cancer cell apoptosis. However, cancer cells inherently have and acquire many antiapoptosis mechanisms, causing cancer drug resistance and poor prognoses in patients. Herein, a potent paraptosis-inducing nanomedicine is reported that causes quick nonapoptotic death of cancer cells, overcoming apoptosis-based resistance and effectively inhibiting drug-resistant tumor growth. The nanomedicine is composed of micelles made from an amphiphilic 8-hydroxyquinoline (HQ)-conjugate block copolymer with polyethylene glycol. Cu2+ can catalyze the hydrolysis of the HQ conjugation linker and liberate HQ, and these molecules can form the complex Cu(HQ)2 , a strong proteasome inhibitor effective at inducing cell paraptosis. In vivo, the Cu2+ -responsive HQ-releasing micelles respond to elevated tumor Cu2+ levels or externally administered Cu2+ and effectively inhibit the growth of human breast adenocarcinoma doxorubicin-resistant (MCF-7/ADR) tumors. Compared with other nanomedicines that overcome drug resistance via delivering several agents or even siRNA, this paraptosis-inducing nanomedicine provides a simple but potent approach to overcoming cancer drug resistance."

"Zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) is a highly potent second-generation photosensitizer for cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT) with attractive photo-physical and photo-chemical properties. However, poor solubility and strong trend of crystallization prevent it from loading in most of drug delivery systems and hamper its further application. Herein, to overcome this problem, an amphiphilic block copolymer poly(ethylene glycol)-poly[2-(methylacryloyl)ethylnicotinate] (PEG-PMAN) with aromatic nicotinate is used to load ZnPc for their π-π interactions. The formed PEG-PMAN/ZnPc nanoparticle (PPZ) dramatically increases reactive oxygen species production in osteosarcoma cells after light irradiation, causes mitochondrial injury and promotes cell cycle arrest at G2/M, leading to a 100-fold cytotoxicity improvement comparing with free ZnPc. The excellent therapeutic effectiveness and safety of PPZ are also proved by in vivo experiments operating on osteosarcoma model. The finding above indicates that PPZ has promising clinical applications as a next-generation photosensitizer in PDT of osteosarcoma."
"amines were found to remarkably enhance the catalytic activity of ATRP catalysts CuBr/tris[(2-pyridyl)methyl]amine and CuBr/tris[2-(dimethylamino)ethylamine]. These two catalysts alone failed to polymerize MA, MMA, and styrene at reduced catalyst concentrations. With tertiary amines such as triethylamine both catalysts could mediate fast polymerizations of the three monomers in a controlled manner at as low as 1 mol-% catalyst relative to initiator. A mechanism study showed that tertiary amines reduced copper(II) complexes to active copper(I) complexes."
"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal cancer with a dismal overall prognosis mainly unchanged over the past decades. PDAC is generally refractory to conventional treatments, and thus novel therapies are urgently needed. Recently, accumulating evidence has indicated that human pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) facilitate PDAC development and drug resistance through paracrine activation of hedgehog pathway. Here, we report that smart SN38 (active metabolite of irinotecan) polymeric prodrug-based nanoparticles effectively encapsulate the commercial hedgehog pathway inhibitor GDC-0449 for co-delivery. More intriguingly, we obtained size-tunable nanoparticles with increased GDC-0449 loading efficiency by simply extending the chain length of the hydrophobic SN38 block. To better evaluate the efficacy and investigate the synergistic mechanisms, we immortalized human PSCs and established fibroblast-containing models in vitro and in vivo. In PSCs, BxPC-3 cells and MIA PaCa-2 cells, GDC-0449 suppressed the co-culture induced up-regulations of the two drug resistance contributors: sonic hedgehog transcription factor glioma-associated protein1 (GLI-1) and UGT1A glucuronosyltransferase. Importantly, the nanoparticle-mediated co-delivery system exhibited potent antitumor efficacy with enhanced apoptosis and reduced collagen, α-SMA and GLI-1 expression in tumor tissues. These findings reveal a potential strategy to utilize nanoparticle-mediated drug co-delivery platform as an effective combination therapy for fibroblast-enriched PDAC."
"repare RGD-modified long circulating liposome (LCL) loading matrine (RGD-M-LCL) to improve the tumor-targeting and efficacy of matrine. Methods: LCL which was prepared with HSPC, cholesterol, DSPE-PEG2000 and DSPE-PEG-MAL was modified with an RGD motif confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The encapsulation efficiency of RGD-M-LCL was also detected by HPLC. MTT assay was used to examine the effects of RGD-M-LCL on the proliferation of Bcap-37, HT-29 and A375 cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells and morphological changes in Bcap-37 cells treated with RGD-M-LCL were detected by Annexin-V-FITC/PI affinity assay and observed under light microscope, respectively. Results: Spherical or oval single-chamber particles of uniform sizes with little agglutination or adhesion were observed under transmission electronic microscope. The RGD motif was successfully coupled to the DSPE-PEG-MAL on liposomes, as confirmed by HPLC. An encapsulation efficiency of 83.13% was obtained when the drug-lipid molar ratio was 0.1, and the encapsulation efficiency was negatively related to the drug-lipid ratio in the range of 0.1~0.4, and to the duration of storage. We found that, compared with free matrine, RGD-M-LCL had much stronger in vitro activity, leading to anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects against cancer cells (P<0.01). Conclusion: RGD-M-LCL, a novel delivery system for anti-cancer drugs, was successfully prepared, and we demonstrated that the use of this material could augment the effects of matrine on cancer cells in vitro."

"l particles grafted with tetraethyldiethylenetriamine were synthesized as support for CuBr for the heterogeneous atom transfer radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA). The immobilized CuBr mediated a living polymerization of MMA, demonstrated by an increase in molecular weight with conversion and low polydispersity. An excessive amount of catalyst (typically, CuBr/initiator = 1.5) was required to achieve a living process because of the limited mobility of the supported catalyst. The silica-gel concentration had a strong effect on the polymerization. The recycled catalyst still mediated a living process but showed a reduced catalytic activity due to the presence of Cu(II). After being regenerated by a reaction with Cu(0), the catalyst regained its activity. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Polym Sci A: Polym Chem 39: 1051–1059, 2001"
"olypyrrole (PPy) with high conductivity (27 S/cm) has been prepared by chemical polymerization of pyrrol monomer in the presence of β-naphthalene sulphonic acid (NSA) as a dopant. The solubility of the resulting conducting polymer of PPy-NSA in m-cresol increases with increasing the concentration of NSA in the polymerization media, and the highest solubility of PPy-NSA in m-cresol is about 1.2 g/100 mL. The room-temperature conductivity of PPy-NSA significantly increases with the concentration of NSA when the concentration of NSA is less than 0.1 mol/L, while it slightly decreases with increasing the concentration of NSA after the concentration of NSA is higher than 0.1 mol/L. UV-VIS spectra and ESR measurements demonstrate that both polaron and bipolaron are present as a charge carrier. The resulting PPy-NSA exhibits unusual fibrillar morphology with a diameter of about 0.5 μm, which is quite different from the granular morphology of PPy doped with dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) and HCl.

"iated protein 1 (YAP1) is an oncogene that plays multiple roles in the tumorigenesis and progression of many malignances. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of YAP1 expression in human osteosarcoma (OS) and explore the molecular mechanisms of YAP1 activity in OS MG-63 cells. The expression of YAP1 was assessed by immunohistochemical assay using a tissue microarray procedure. A loss-of-function approach was used to investigate the effects of small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of YAP1 on the expression of RUNX2, CyclinD1, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) as well as the proliferative activities and invasive potential in OS MG-63 cells (evaluated by MTT and Transwell assays, respectively). The expression of YAP1 protein in OS tissues was significantly higher than that in ANCT, and was closely associated with gender (P = 0.013) and Enneking staging (P = 0.035), but it did not correlate with age, tumor location, or distant metastases of OS patients (P > 0.05, each). Knockdown of YAP1 resulted in downregulation of the expression of RUNX2, CyclinD1, and MMP-9 and inhibited the proliferation and invasion of MG-63 cells. Our findings suggest that YAP1 is highly expressed in OS tissues, and increased expression of this molecule is correlated with the gender and Enneking staging of osteosarcoma patients. Knockdown of YAP1 may inhibit the proliferation and invasion of OS cells through downregulation of the RUNX2 pathway, thereby representing a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer."
"Curcumin, a polyphenol derived from the rhizome turmeric, has potential as an anticancer agent. We synthesized an amphipathic/surfactant pegylated curcumin (curcumin-PEG) designed for parenteral administration. Objectives of these investigations were to assess side-effects of a therapeutic regimen of curcumin-PEG in a preclinical model. Intraperitoneal (ip) tumor burdens were reduced in athymic female mice grafted with human SKOV-3 ovarian adenocarcinoma cells and injected intravenously (iv) with curcumin-PEG. There were no gross anatomical or histopathological effects detected in non-reproductive organs. Uteri (luminal fluid imbibition) and ovaries (decreased folliculogenesis) were affected by treatment. Curcumin-PEG ip hastened the onset of puberty in immature female mice. Live births were reduced in mature females housed with males and treated iv with curcumin-PEG; mating (vaginal plugs) was not affected. Accessory gland weights, testicular testosterone concentrations, and spermatogenesis were diminished in mature male mice following iv curcumin-PEG. Estrogenic/antiandrogenic and pregnancy-disrupting effects of a water soluble/bioavailable curcumin were demonstrated."

"Tumor-targeting, redox-responsive and high drug-loaded nanoparticles were synthesized from poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(l-lysine) (PEG-PLL) for enhanced cancer therapy. A hydrophobic drug camptothecin (CPT) was anchored to the lysine residual amines in PEG-PLL via disulfide bonds. Folate acid as targeting group was further introduced to the PLL block via long PEG chains. The conjugate self-assembled into nanoparticles of around 100 nm with hydrophobic CPT moieties forming the core and folate acid targeting groups on the shell. The nanoparticles were expected to be stable in the blood circulation but once internalized via folate receptor-mediated endocytosis, disintegrate and release the drug by glutathione in the cytosol. The nanoparticles could be used as a nanocarrier to further encapsulate other drugs such as doxorubicin for combined chemotherapy. The CPT-conjugated nanoparticles had comparable cytotoxicity to free CPT at low doses but higher cytotoxicity than CPT at high doses."
"pregnated, brominated PPO [poly(phenylene oxide)] (BPPO) membranes exhibit enhanced CO2 permeability relative to pure BPPO membranes due to higher gas solubility and especially higher gas diffusivity. Among the three silica sizes (2, 10, and 30 nm) characterized in this work, the 10 nm silica is found to result in the highest gas permeability, about 5 times higher than that of the pure BPPO membranes. These permeability enhancements do not cause an appreciable loss of selectivity, which remains essentially unchanged, for example, about 21 for the CO2/N2 separation and about 15 for the CO2/CH4 separation. The permeability increases with increasing silica content, which, however, cannot exceed about 0.35 silica/BPPO weight ratio due to a substantial increase in brittleness."
"Integration of biological macromolecules with inorganic materials via biomineralization has demonstrated great potential for development of nanotheranostic agents. To produce multifunctionality, integration of multiple components in the biomineralized theranostic agents is required; however, how to efficiently and reproducibly implement this is challenging. In this report, a universal biomineralization strategy is developed by incorporation of oxidization polymerization into albumin-templated biomineralization for facile synthesis of nanotheranostic agents. A series of biomineralized polymers and manganese dioxide hybrid nanoparticles (PMHNs) can be synthesized via the polymerization of various monomers, including dopamine (DA), epigallocatechin (EGC), pyrrole (PY), and diaminopyridine (DP), along with the reduction of KMnO4 and formation of manganese dioxide nanoparticles in albumin templates. These biomineralized PMHNs demonstrate ultrahigh MRI (longitudinal relaxivity up to 38 mM-1 s-1) and ultrasonic (US) imaging contrasting capabilities and have excellent photothermal therapy efficacy with complete ablation of orthotopic tumors. Moreover, these biomineralized hybrid nanoparticles can be effectively excreted through the kidneys, avoiding potential systemic toxicity. Thus, integration of polymerization into biomineralization presents a strategy for the fabrication of hybrid nanomaterials, allowing the production of multifunctional and biocompatible nanotheranostic agents via a facile one-pot method."
"ble catalyst immobilization system via self-assembly of hydrogen bonding between thymine anchored on silica gel support and 2,6-diaminopyridine functionalized with a catalyst (copper bromide-N,N,N',N'-tetraethyldiethylenetriamine (TEDETA) complex) was developed for the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of methyl methacrylate (MMA). At elevated temperatures, the hydrogen bonding disassociated and released the catalyst as free small molecules for catalysis, which effectively mediated a living polymerization of MMA, producing PMMA with controlled molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution (<1.3). At room temperature, the catalyst assembled on the silica gel support by hydrogen bonding, and thus could be recovered and reused for a second run of ATRP. The recovered catalyst still mediated a living polymerization of MMA with reduced activity (54-64%), but had much improved control of the polymerization. The resulting PMMA had molecular weights very close to theoretical vales."
"polymerization of trimethylene carbonate (TMC) with ϵ-caprolactone (CL) catalyzed by rare earth chloride-epoxide or rare earth isopropoxide has been investigated for the first time. It was found that in the presence of epoxide, rare earth chlorides have high activities for the copolymerization, giving high-molecular-weight random copolymer P(CL-co-TMC) with a narrow molecular weight distribution. Light rare earth chloride-propylene oxide systems are more effective for the copolymerization than heavy rare earth chloride-propylene oxide systems. For the rare earth chloride-epoxide catalyst system, epoxide is the requisite component, and its amount affects the catalytic activity; while rare earth isopropoxide can catalyze the copolymerization alone. The preparative conditions of the copolymer with NdCl3-5PO system were studied. The reactivity ratios of CL and TMC copolymerization with NdCl3-5PO determined by Fineman-Ross method are 1.60 for rTMC and 0.72 for rCL, respectively. The copolymers were characterized by 1H- and 13C-NMR, GPC, and DSC. The mechanism study shows that the rare earth alkoxide is the active species that initiates the ring opening copolymerization of CL and TMC with acyl-oxygen bond cleavages of the monomers. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

"Near-infrared-II (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) bioimaging features high penetration depth and high spatio-temporal resolution compared to traditional fluorescence imaging, but the key is to develop stable and biocompatible NIR-II fluorophores suitable for in vivo applications. Silver sulfide quantum dots (Ag2S QDs) have been demonstrated to be excellent for in vivo NIR-II imaging with unique optical properties and decent biocompatibility, but they often require complex post modifications for in vivo applications. Herein we demonstrate a facile one-pot strategy to synthesize PEGylated dendrimer-encapsulated Ag2S QDs useful for in vivo NIR-II imaging. Silver ions were first loaded into the core of an acylthiourea-functionalized dendrimer (PEG-PATU) through coordination between silver ions and acylthiourea groups, followed by the addition of sodium sulfide to form Ag2S QDs in situ. The resulting PEG-PATU Ag2S QDs exhibit excellent NIR-II fluorescence signals, and thus could be used for high efficiency labelling and tracking of A549 cancer cell mobility in vivo and real time visualization of the vast circulatory network of a mouse."
"Many metal-organic complexes showed potent anticancer efficacy, but their clinical applications were limited by the lack of administration route because of their poor solubility. To make metal-organic nanoparticles (MONPs) comprising metal complex drugs is a new formulation strategy for their administration. Herein, we developed a facile synthesis of an MONP composed of bovine serum albumin (BSA), Cu2+, and an anticancer agent, 5-nitro-8-hydroxyquinoline (NQ) with albumin as a nanoreactor. The resultant BSA/Cu/NQ nanoparticle (BSA/Cu/NQ NP) showed good stability in different physiological buffers and could target tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention effect and receptor-mediated cellular uptake. As the BSA/Cu/NQ NP could be readily and efficiently internalized by cancer cells, it showed much higher cytotoxic cancer cells than the NQ + Cu(II) complex and NQ. Therefore, the treatment with BSA/Cu/NQ NP noticeably enhanced the anticancer efficacy without causing systemic toxicity, indicating that such a facile preparation method has great potential to prepare other metal complex nanoparticles for drug delivery."
"olypyrrole (PPy) could be synthesized by in situ doping polymerization in the presence of β-naphthalene sulfonic acid (NSA) as dopant. The resultant tubular PPy–NSA not only exhibits high room temperature conductivity (ςRT = 10 S/cm) but is also soluble in m-cresol. The molecular structure of PPy–NSA is identical to the characteristic structure of PPy synthesized by a conventional method. It has been demonstrated that NSA dopant with large molecular size and plate–lebe structure is a key factor to control formation of tubular PPy–NSA. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

"ctors play a vital role in wound healing, and novel hydrogel carriers suitable for growth factors have always been a research hotspot in the wound healthcare field. In this work, a wound microenvironment-responsive hydrogel drug-loading system was constructed by cross-linking of the internal electron-deficient polyester and bovine serum albumin (BSA) via catalyst-free amino-yne bioconjugation. The slightly acidic microenvironment of wound tissues induces the charge removal of BSA chains, thus releasing the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) loaded through electrostatic action. Besides, the BSA chains in the gel network further endow their excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, also making them more suitable for bFGF loading. The wound caring evaluation of the hydrogel in the full-thickness skin wound indicated that the protein-based hydrogel significantly promotes the proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts, collagen accumulation, and epidermal layer stacking, thus significantly shortening the healing process. This strategy paved the way for broadening the application of the growth factors in the wound care field."
"In situ injectable hydrogels have shown tremendous potential application in the biomedical field due to their significant drug accumulation at lesion sites, sustained release and markedly reduced systemic side effects. Specifically, peptide-based hydrogels, with unique biodegradation, biocompatibility, and bioactivity, are attractive molecular skeletons. In addition, peptides play a prominent role in normal metabolism, mimicking the natural tissue microenvironment and responding to stimuli in the lesion environment. Their advantages endow peptide-based hydrogels with great potential for application as biomedical materials. In this review, the fabrication and production of peptide-based hydrogels are presented. Several promising candidates, which are smart and environment-sensitive, are briefly reviewed. Then, the recent developments of these hydrogels for biomedical applications in tissue engineering, as drug/gene vehicles, and anti-bacterial agents are discussed. Finally, the development of peptide-based injectable hydrogels for biomedical applications in the future is surveyed."
"In order to achieve a precise therapeutic effect of cancer treatment and improve the utilization of drugs, a temperature-, pH-, and redox-responsive drug delivery system were synthesized. Methacrylic acid (MAA), poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA), and N,N'-bis(acryloyl)cystamine (BACy), a disulfide bond contained cross-linker, were polymerized by a distillation-precipitation polymerization. Doxorubicin (DOX), an anti-cancer drug, can be loaded into the loose nanoparticle (NP) effectively. The prepared drug delivery remains stable during blood circulation and, when the vectors accumulated at tumor tissues, the pH-response of MMA and temperature-response of PNIPAM makes volume shrinkage of vectors which benefit the diffusion of vectors into tumor tissues. After being endocytosed into tumor cell, the disulfide bond that contained in the drug delivery can be cleaved by glutathione (GSH), causing the decomposition of NPs, and then release all of the drug. Under the influence of three trigger factors, the triple stimuli-responsive drug delivery vectors can realize tumor accumulation, tumor penetration and controlled drug release. Thus, the prepared multi-responsive NP is ideal drug carriers for developing novel drug delivery systems. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A: 106A: 3203-3210, 2018."

"labeling of biomarkers with bright and high photostable fluorophores is vital in fluorescent imaging applications. Here, we report a general strategy to develop single-molecule dendritic nanodots with finely tunable optical properties for in vivo fluorescent imaging. The well-defined nanodots are based on the divergent growth of biodegradable polylysine dendrimers with fluorophore as the core. By tuning the size and surface chemistry, we obtained fluorescent nanodots with excellent brightness and photostability, favorable pharmacokinetics, and multivalent tumor-targeting capability. The nanodots provided robust, stable, long-lasting, and specific fluorescence enhancement in tumor tissue with an in situ tumor-to-normal ratio (TNR) of ~3 and lasting over 5 days, and ex vivo TNR up to ~17, holding considerable promise for cancer imaging and image-guided surgery. This strategy significantly improves the in vivo performance of fluorophores and can be applied to other modality imaging probes."
"Manganese dioxide nanomaterial is a new type of inorganic nanomaterial offering numerous advantages: simple preparation, low cost, and environmental friendliness. This review summarizes the traditional and novel synthetic methods for manganese dioxide nanomaterials and mainly discusses their potential in biomedical applications. Manganese dioxide nanomaterials are mainly used as drug carriers in tumor therapy. In recent years, the construction of multifunctional nano-platforms using manganese dioxide has gradually improved. The main mechanism is that manganese dioxide nanomaterials can combine with reactive oxygen species in the tumor microenvironment to alleviate tumor hypoxia. Manganese dioxide has also been used to quench fluorescent carbon dots in fluorescent probes. Based on the oxidation ability and catalytic activity of MnO2, MnO2 nanosheets are widely used to build biosensors. New research shows that manganese dioxide nanomaterials also have great potential in gene therapy and nuclear magnetic imaging."
"A fast adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-depleting micellar system that is activated by intracellular redox for the codelivery of anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) and small interference RNA (siRNA) targeting polo-like kinase1 (PLK1) is developed to address the key challenges of multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer therapy. The ATP-depleting micelle is self-assembled from a redox-responsive amphiphilic polymer (termed as bPEG-SS-P123-PEI (PSPP)) that is composed of biocompatible branched polyethylene glycol (PEG) with 8 arms (bPEG), ATP-depleting Pluronic P123 (P123), and cationic low molecular weight polyethylenimine (PEI) blocks. Upon critical micelle concentration, the PSPP unimer self-assembles into a well-ordered multilayered nanostructure and is able to load PTX and siRNA targeting PLK1. The cleavage of disulfide linkages at intracellular glutathione-rich reduction milieu not only promotes PTX and siRNA release, but also activates the fast ATP-depletion action that is critical in preventing intracellular PTX efflux by multidrug-resistant cancer cells. The combination of ATP depletion and siRNA inhibition by PSPP micelles is found to provide dual modulations for resensitizing multidrug-resistant cancer cells for PTX treatment. As a result, the codelivery of PTX and PLK1 siRNA exerts a stronger combinational effect against tumor growth in MDR tumor models in vivo. The development of fast ATP-depleting nanomicelle represents an original delivery strategy for the distinctive dual modulation of cancer MDR with spatial and temporal control."
"uble cationic macromonomers of (dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) with terminal diallylmethylammonium or allylmethylphenylammonium group were synthesized by nitrogen anion (nitroanion) initiated living anionic polymerization of DMAEMA and subsequent quaternization. The initiators, lithium diallyamide and lithium allylphenylamide, were prepared by the reaction of corresponding N-substituted allylamine with butyllithium. The substituents on the nitroanion had a significant effect on the initiation efficiency. The initiator efficiencies of lithium allylamide, diallylamide, and allylphenylamide increased by the order 0 < 25% < 79% at −78 °C. The low initiator efficiency of lithium diallylamide was due to the reaction of the nitroanion with carbonyl groups in the monomer and polymer and could not be improved by optimizing polymerization conditions. A capping method using dimethylacrylamide (DMA) or tert-butyl methacrylate (tBMA) was then developed to modify the lithium diallylamide and thereby..."
"istics and mechanisms of the ring opening-polymerizations of e-caprolactone (CL) and trimethylene carbonate (TMC) with rare earth halides have been compared for the first time. It has been found that rare earth halides show high catalytic activities for the polymerization of TMC, but very low activities for that of CL polymerization. The copolymerization of CL and TMC can proceed only in the presence of high contents of TMC in the comonomer feed. The copolymerization rate decreases rapidly with increasing molar fraction of CL in the feed. The mechanism study by IR, 1H-, 13C-, and 31P-NMR spectra shows that the first step reaction of the polymerization of TMC or CL with rare earth halide is the complexation of monomer to the rare earth ion. The strong coordination of TMC to rare earth ion induces the ring-cleavage of TMC and generation of the cationic species, which initiate the polymerization of TMC via a cationic process. However, the polymerization of CL with rare earth halide is an “activated-hydrolysis” process, in which rare earth catalyst does not initiate the polymerization but serves as an activator of CL. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

"e to sorafenib severely hinders its effectiveness against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cancer stemness is closely connected with resistance to sorafenib. Methods for reversing the cancer stemness remains one of the largest concerns in research and the lack of such methods obstructs current HCC therapeutics. Ubiquitin‐specific protease 22 (USP22) is reported to play a pivotal role in HCC stemness and multidrug resistance (MDR). Herein, a galactose‐decorated lipopolyplex (Gal‐SLP) is developed as an HCC‐targeting self‐activated cascade‐responsive nanoplatform to co‐delivery sorafenib and USP22 shRNA (shUSP22) for synergetic HCC therapy. Sorafenib, entrapped in the Gal‐SLPs, induced a reactive oxygen species (ROS) cascade and triggered rapid shUSP22 release. Thus, Gal‐SLPs dramatically suppressed the expression of USP22. The downregulation of USP22 suppresses multidrug resistance‐associated protein 1 (MRP1) to induce intracellular sorafenib accumulation and hampers glycolysis of HCC cells. As a result, Gal‐SLPs efficiently inhibit the viability, proliferation, and colony formation of HCC cells. A sorafenib‐insensitive patient‐derived xenograft (PDX) model is established and adopted to evaluate in vivo antitumor effect of Gal‐SLPs. Gal‐SLPs exhibit potent antitumor efficiency and biosafety. Therefore, Gal‐SLPs are expected to have great potential in the clinical treatment of HCC."

"Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) is the main bioactive flavonoid extracted from the flower of Carthamus tinctorius L., which is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of myocardial ischemia and cerebral ischemia. HSYA has high water solubility but poor intestinal membrane permeability, resulting in low oral bioavailability. Currently, only HSYA sodium chloride injection has been approved for clinical use and oral formulations are urgently needed. In this study, HSYA solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) with the structure of w/o/w were prepared by a warm microemulsion process using approved drug excipients for oral delivery to increase the oral absorption of HSYA. The optimized HSYA SLNs are spherical with an average size of 214nm and the encapsulation efficiency is 55%. HSYA SLNs exhibited little cytotoxicity in Caco-2 and Hela cells, but increased the oral absorption of HSYA about 3.97-fold in rats, compared to HSYA water solution. In addition, cycloheximide pretreatment significantly decreased the oral absorption of HSYA delivered by SLNs. Importantly, the pharmacodynamics evaluation demonstrated that SLNs further decreased the infarct areas in rats. In conclude, SLNs could be a promising delivery system to enhance the oral absorption and pharmacological activities of HSYA."
"aper, a magnetic-based, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) assay for detection of a cancer-related microRNA biomarker, miR-141, has been developed. The detection is based on hybridization-dependent recognition, in which the miR-141 target sequences were captured by complementary reporter and capture oligonucleotide probes conjugated to Raman-tagged gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and gold-coated paramagnetic nanoparticles (Au@MNPs) respectively. The resultant hybridization complexes, Raman-tagged GNPs/miR-141/Au@MNPs, are retrieved from solution by magnetic pull-down and concentrated within the focus of laser excitation. A signature spectrum for the Raman tag, 5,5′-dithiobis(succinimidyl-2-nitrobenzoate) (DSNB), was observed in concentrated pellets and specific for the miR-141 sequences. The viability of SERS detection has been demonstrated in a microfluidic platform, in which the hybridizations containing dilutions of the miR-141 sequences yielded a reduction in the DSNB spectrum peaks' intensity. The limit of detection (LOD) is estimated to be 100 fM, which is 100-fold lower than the LOD of 10 pM previously reported in a similar magnetic-capture SERS detection of small oligonucleotides using nonplasmonic MNPs. These results indicate that the addition of Au shells to MNPs facilitates the formation of SERS-active junction regions (“hot spots”) with nearby Au contents within the magnetic concentrates, which substantially improves the SERS signal and, therefore, detection sensitivity."
"Thermoresponsive polymers have many biomedical applications, but their nondegradability limits their in vivo applications. Herein, we report a new type of degradable thermoresponsive polymers-degradable poly (ethylene glycol) analogues (DPEGs) having lower critical solution temperatures (LCSTs) ranging 10-50 degrees C. DPEGs were synthesized by condensation polymerization of PEG-di(meth)acrylates (PEGDA or PEGDMA) with dithiols. Their LCSTs could be easily tuned by the PEG-chain length and the types of the double bond in the PEG monomers and dithiols. Long PEG chain and the presence of hydrophilic groups in the dithiol monomer increased the LCST of the resulting DPEG. Crosslinking DPEG chains produced thermoresponsive hydrogels. The hydrogels prepared by the end-capping method maintained the thermoresponsive properties of the linear DPEG. The degradable thermoresponsive DPEGs and their hydrogels have great potentials for in vivo biomedical applications."
"Albumin-based nanomedicines are important nanoplatforms for cancer drug delivery. The drugs are either physically encapsulated or covalently conjugated to albumin or albumin-based nanosystems. Physical encapsulation is advantageous due to requiring no chemical modification of drug molecules, but many drugs, for instance, camptothecin (CPT) and curcumin (CCM), though very hydrophobic, can't be loaded in or form nanoformulations with albumin. Herein, we demonstrate prodrugs readily binding to proteins via iminoboronates and forming nanoparticles for cancer drug delivery. CPT and CCM were functionalized with 2-acetylphenylboronic acid (2-APBA) to produce prodrugs CPT-SS-APBA and CCM- APBA. The prodrugs bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA) via formation of iminoboronates and the produced BSA/prodrug readily self-assembled into well-defined nanoparticles with high loading efficiency, improved colloidal stability, and much-improved pharmacokinetics. The nanoparticles effectively released drugs in the intracellular acidic environment or the cytosol rich in glutathione (GSH). In vivo, the nanoparticles showed enhanced anticancer efficacy compared with clinically used irinotecan or sorafenib in subcutaneous 4 T1 or HepG2 tumor models. This work demonstrates a versatile protein-binding prodrug platform applicable to protein-based drug formulations and even antibody-drug conjugates."

"Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is widely used as a water soluble carrier for polymer-drug conjugates. Herein, we report degradable linear PEG analogs (DPEGs) carrying multifunctional groups. The DPEGs were synthesized by a Michael addition based condensation polymerization of dithiols and PEG diacrylates (PEGDA) or dimethacrylates (PEGDMA). They were stable at pH 7.4 but quickly degraded at pH 6.0 and 5.0. Thus, DPEGs could be used as drug carriers without concern for their retention in the body. DPEGs could be made to carry such functional groups as terminal thiol or (meth)acrylate and pendant hydroxyl groups. The functional groups were used for conjugation of drugs and targeting groups. This new type of PEG analog will be useful for drug delivery and the PEGylation of biomolecules and colloidal particles."
"olymerization of 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) with 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) was studied in methanol using a macroinitiator method and a one-pot sequential addition method. The polymerization sequence of the two monomers strongly affected the block copolymer formation. When DMAEMA was used at the first monomer, both methods produced block copolymer samples containing significant amounts of DMAEMA homopolymer chains, because of the elimination of active halogen chain-ends during the preparation of polyDMAEMA. Well-controlled block copolymers with various block lengths were obtained via the macroinitiator to initiate the polymerization of DMAEMA. The sequential addition method, in which HEMA was polymerized first with 90% conversion and DMAEMA was subsequently added, also yielded controlled block copolymers when the polymerization was carried out at room temperature with the DMAEMA conversion below 60%. Increasing the temperature to 60 °C promoted the copolymerization rate but the reaction suffered from gel formation. The addition of water to the system accelerated the polymerization rate, but led to the loss of the system livingness."

"Indocyanine green (ICG), a safe and clinically approved near-infrared (NIR) dye, was recently explored as a potential photosensitizer due to its excellent photophysical properties. However, ICG tends to form aggregations in physiological solution, causing fluorescence quenching, fast blood clearance and thereby inefficient tumor accumulation. Herein, we report ICG-based nanodrug delivery systems formed by self-assembly of ICG and chemotherapeutic drugs without any excipients for combined chemo- and photo-therapy. Taking advantage of the amphiphilic aromatic structure, ICG readily bounded with hydrophobic aromatic drugs such as SN38 and formed well-dispersible nanoparticles, which reduced its aggregation-induced quenching and thus greatly improved its photodynamic efficiency. The loaded hydrophobic drugs elicited chemotherapy synergizing the photodynamic therapy, giving rise to much enhanced antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo against human glioblastoma cells and breast cancer cells upon NIR irradiation. The work demonstrates the fabrication of readily translational nanoformulations of hydrophobic drugs using amphiphilic drugs."
"Macrophages are the most plastic cells in the hematopoietic system and they exhibit great functional diversity. They have been extensively applied in anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-cancer therapies. However, the application of macrophages is limited by the efficiency of their engineering. The macrophage mannose receptor (MMR, CD206), a C-type lectin receptor, is ubiquitously expressed on macrophages and has a high affinity for mannose oligosaccharides. In the present study, we developed a novel non-viral vehicle with specific affinity for MMR. Mannan was cationized with spermine at a grafted ratio of ∼12% to deliver DNA and was characterized as a stable system for delivery. This spermine-mannan (SM)-based delivery system was evaluated as a biocompatible vehicle with superior transfection efficiency on murine macrophages, up to 28.5-fold higher than spermine-pullulan, 11.5-fold higher than polyethylenimine and 3.0-fold higher than Lipofectamine™ 2000. We confirmed that the SM-based delivery system for macrophages transfection was MMR-specific and we described the intracellular transport of the delivery system. To our knowledge, this is the first study using SM to demonstrate a mannose receptor-specific gene delivery system, thereby highlighting the potential of a novel specific non-viral delivery vehicle for macrophage engineering."
"r nanomedicines have been proven effective in mitigating the side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, challenges remain in augmenting their therapeutic efficacy. Nanomedicines responsive to the pathological abnormalities in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are expected to overcome the biological limitations of conventional nanomedicines, enhance the therapeutic efficacies, and further reduce the side effects. This Review aims to quantitate the various pathological abnormalities in the TME, which may serve as unique endogenous stimuli for the design of stimuli-responsive nanomedicines, and to provide a broad and objective perspective on the current understanding of stimuli-responsive nanomedicines for cancer treatment. We dissect the typical transport process and barriers of cancer drug delivery, highlight the key design principles of stimuli-responsive nanomedicines designed to tackle the series of barriers in the typical drug delivery process, and discuss the ""all-into-one"" and ""one-for-all"" strategies for integrating the needed properties for nanomedicines. Ultimately, we provide insight into the challenges and future perspectives toward the clinical translation of stimuli-responsive nanomedicines."
"The cancer drug delivery process involves a series of biological barriers, which require the nanomedicine to exhibit different, even opposite properties for high therapeutic efficacy. The prevailing design philosophy, i.e., integrating these properties within one nanomedicine via on-demand property transitions such as PEGylation/dePEGylation, complicates nanomedicines' composition and thus impedes clinical translation. Here, polyzwitterionic micelles of poly(tertiary amine-oxide)-block-poly(ε-caprolactone) (PTAO-PCL) amphiphiles that enable all the required functions are presented. The zwitterionic nature and unique cell membrane affinity confer the PTAO micelles long blood circulation, efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and fast cellular internalization. The mitochondrial targeting capability allows drug delivery into the mitochondria to induce mitochondrial dysfunction and overcome tumor multidrug resistance. As a result, the PTAO/drug micelles exhibit potent anticancer efficacy. This simple yet multipotent carrier system holds great promise as a generic platform for potential clinical translation."

" gadolinium chelates as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents (CAs) have shown great potential in blood pool and tumor imaging due to their enhanced relaxivities (R1s), prolonged blood circulation time, and homogeneous pharmaceutical properties. However, the non-biodegradability of the currently used dendrimers causes long-term retention of toxic gadolinium ions, limiting their clinical applications. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of biodegradable polyester dendrimer-based CAs. The prepared dendritic CAs have nano-sized structures with the hydrodynamic diameters ranging from 2.8 to 8.6 nm, and show high R1s up to 11.7 mM−1 s−1, approximately 2.7 times that of a clinically used small molecule CA (Magnevist). They are slowly hydrolyzed at an acidic pH, but rapidly hydrolyzed at pH 7.4, especially in the presence of esterase. The in vivo evaluation indicates they not only provide much better MRI contrast enhancement than Magnevist, but also show minimal tissue retention of Gd, which is much lower than those of non-biodegradable CAs."
"Monodisperse cross-linked poly (styrene-divinylbenzene) (P(S-DVB)) porous microspheres with a particle size of about 10 μm were obtained by using the improved two-step seed swelling polymerization method. The influence of different crosslinking degree on specific surface area of porous microparticles was carefully investigated. The surface morphology and pore structure of seed microspheres and porous microspheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), accelerated surface area and porosimetry analyzer. Porous P(S-DVB) microparticles were sulfonated and used as a hydrophilic column packing material for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The separation of oxalic acid, formic acid, acetic acid and acrylic acid was achieved by using the sulfonated-P(S-DVB) particles as packing materials in HPLC. The back pressure of sulfonated-P(S-DVB) column could be maintained at especially low level even at high flow rates due to the excellent permeability of the fillers. Moreover, the separation of chiral drugs was successfully carried out by using the chitosan coated sulfonated-P(S-DVB) microspheres as a column packing material in HPLC. By using water soluble non-toxic photosensitive diazoresin (DR) as linker, a green and facile way to modify packing materials was developed."

"NIR-II fluorescence imaging has great potential in diagnosis, but the quantum efficiency of contrast agents is an urgent problem to be solved. We synthesized two new multifunctional polymers, P-TT and P-DPP, with a tetrahedral C (sp3) and branched alkyl chains in the main chain, which were beneficial to obtain high quantum efficiency. P-TT and P-DPP showed absorption peaks of 686 nm and 763 nm, respectively, and fluorescence emission peaks of 1071 nm and 1066 nm, respectively. The photothermal effect of P-DPP can reach 52 °C, and the quantum yield reaches 1.5%, which was three times higher than that of nanotube fluorophores (quantum yield 0.4%). P-DPP is used for stable fluorescence imaging of blood vessels and photoacoustic imaging of nude mice, and successfully applied to phototherapy of nude mouse tumours."
"Self-assembled drug delivery systems (sDDSs), made from nanocarriers and drugs, are one of the major types of nanomedicines, many of which are in clinical use, under preclinical investigation, or in clinical trials. One of the hurdles of this type of nanomedicine in real applications is the inherent complexity of their fabrication processes, which generally lack precise control over the sDDS structures and the batch-to-batch reproducibility. Furthermore, the classic 2D in vitro cell model, monolayer cell culture, has been used to evaluate sDDSs. However, 2D cell culture cannot adequately replicate in vivo tissue-level structures and their highly complex dynamic 3D environments, nor can it simulate their functions. Thus, evaluations using 2D cell culture often cannot correctly correlate with sDDS behaviors and effects in humans. Microfluidic technology offers novel solutions to overcome these problems and facilitates studying the structure-performance relationships for sDDS developments. In this Review, recent advances in microfluidics for 1) fabrication of sDDSs with well-defined physicochemical properties, such as size, shape, rigidity, and drug-loading efficiency, and 2) fabrication of 3D-cell cultures as ""tissue/organ-on-a-chip"" platforms for evaluations of sDDS biological performance are in focus."
"nic vectors have been used to deliver short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to knock-down genes for cancer therapies, but their inefficiency in lysosomal escape and shRNA release causes their low gene transcription efficiency. Herein, a three-layered polyethyleneimine (PEI)-coated gold nanocomplex interlaid with a pH-responsive charge-reversible chitosan-aconitic anhydride (CS-Aco) is constructed: a Au-PEI/CS-Aco/PEI/shRNA nanoparticle. The negatively charged CS-Aco hydrolyzes into positively charged CS in lysosomes, causing the nanocomposite to disassemble. The released Au-PEI nanoparticles efficiently rupture the lysosomes and thus release the PEI/shRNA polyplexes into cytoplasm, where they quickly disassociate because the PEI chains are short (1.2 kDa). As a consequence, the nanocomplexes display higher shRNA delivery efficiency than the 25 kDa PEI, and efficiently deliver shABCG2 to tumors and markedly silence ABCG2 expression, which sensitizes HepG2 cells to the drugs with minimal toxicity."

"iated gene delivery has been explored for the treatment and protection of cardiomyocytes, but so far there is only one report using cationic polymer for gene delivery to cardiomyocytes in spite of many advantages of polymer‐mediated gene delivery. In this study, a cationic poly(β‐amino ester) (PDMA) with a degradable backbone and cleavable side chains was synthesized by Michael addition reaction. The toxicity of PDMA to neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes (NMCMs) was significantly lower than that of polyethyleneimine (PEI). PDMA formed stable polyplexes with pEGFP. The dissociation of the polyplexes could be triggered by PDMA degradation, and the dissociation time was tunable via the polymer/pEGFP ratio. In vitro transfection showed that PDMA was an effective and low toxic gene delivery carrier for NMCMs. The PDMA/pEGFP polyplexes transfected EGFP gene to NMCMs with about 28% efficiency and caused little death. In contrast, a significant portion of cardiomyocytes cultured with PEI/pEGFP died. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Compared to healthy individuals, cancer patients have aberrantly elevated intratumoral and systemic copper levels, which promote tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, tumor metastasis, and recurrence of diverse human cancers. Two copper‐based anticancer strategies—copper depletion therapy and copper‐based cytotoxin—have been developed for the treatment of cancers. In this review, the authors summarize the roles of copper related to cancer progression and provide the recent therapeutic advances using the copper‐based anticancer strategies and copper‐based nanomedicines. The authors also present their perspectives for further developing antitumor copper‐targeting nanomedicines for enhanced therapeutics and mitigated side effects."
"sses of jellyfish-shaped amphiphilic dendrimers composed of 7 hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) arms and 14 hydrophobic polyester dendrons with β-cyclodextrin (βCD) as the core molecule were synthesized by a facile method. Seven PEG chains were first conjugated to the C-6 positions of native βCD. Subsequently, dendritic polyester architectures were constructed from the remaining 14 secondary hydroxyl groups at C-2 and C-3 positions of the βCD moiety, resulting in jellyfish-shaped amphiphilic dendrimers of different generations (7PEG-βCD-Gx) with well-defined molecular structures. The amphiphilic dendrimers self-assembled into different morphologies dependent upon the hydrophilic fraction of the dendrimers, and very surprisingly, the fourth-generation dendrimers consisting of only several percent of PEG could form aggregates with extremely narrow size distributions."

"-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl acrylate (DMAEA) was investigated using CuBr or CuCl with different multidentate ligands. The catalyst was found active for DMAEA polymerization when ligated with tris[2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl]amine. Good control over molecular weight was achieved, but quaternization of the terminal monomeric/polymeric tertiary amine by the C-Br group of polyDMAEA caused chain termination. Using a chloride-based system helped to suppress chain termination. Amphiphilic poly(methyl acrylate)-block-polyDMAEA was synthesized using polyMA as a macroinitiator."
"nce imaging (FI) and photoacoustic imaging (PA) play important roles in the real‐time assessment of cell‐based therapies. However, the limitations of conventional organic fluorescence contrast agents and the narrow range of the emission wavelength in the first near‐infrared (NIR‐I) window (750–900 nm) hamper applications of fluorescence imaging in living subjects. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a short‐wave infrared FI contrast agent and PA contrast agent based on a conjugated polymer—poly{2,5‐bis[(5‐thiophen‐2‐yl)methylene]‐3,6‐bis(2‐octyldodecyl)‐2,5‐dihydropyrazine}—and its use to construct multifunctional nanoparticles to simplify photothermal therapy."
"In this paper, we reported a pH responsive nano drug delivery system (NDDS) based on ZnO quantum dots (QDs) for controlled release of drugs. Zwitterionic poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (PCBMA) and poly(2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) were introduced to modify ZnO QDs, which can help enhance water stability, increase blood circulation time, and promote endocytosis. After tuning of PCBMA/PDMAEMA ratios, the ZnO@P(CBMA-co-DMAEMA) nanoplatform shows a sensitive switch from strong protein adsorption resistance (with negatively charged surface) at physiological pH to strong adhesion to tumor cell membranes (with positively charged surface) at the slightly acidic extracellular pH of tumors. Anti-cancer drug, Doxorubicin (DOX), molecules were demonstrated to be successfully loaded to ZnO@P(CBMA-co-DMAEMA) with a relatively large drug loading content (24.6%). In addition, ZnO@P(CBMA-co-DMAEMA) loaded with DOX can achieve lysosomal acid degradation and release of DOX after endocytosis by tumor cells, resulting in synergistic treatment of cancer, which is attributed to a combination of the anticancer effect of Zn2+ and DOX."
"Membrane chromatography is mainly used for the separation and purification of proteins and biological macromolecules in the downstream processing process, also applications in sewage disposal. Membrane chromatography is recognized as an effective alternative to column chromatography because it significantly improves chromatography from affinity, hydrophobicity, and ion exchange; the development status of membrane chromatography in membrane matrix and membrane equipment is thoroughly discussed, and the applications of protein capture and intermediate purification, virus, monoclonal antibody purification, water treatment, and others are summarized. This review will provide value for the exploration and potential application of membrane chromatography."
"Nanomedicines generally consisting of carrier materials with small fractions of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) have long been used to improve the pharmacokinetics and biodistributions, augment the therapeutic efficacies and mitigate the side effects. Amphiphilizing hydrophobic/hydrophilic drugs to prodrugs capable of self-assembly into well-defined nanostructures has emerged as a facile approach to fabricating nanomedicines because this amphiphilized prodrug (APD) strategy presents many advantages, including minimized use of inert carrier materials, well-characterized prodrug structures, fixed and high drug loading contents, 100% loading efficiency, and burst-free but controlled drug release. This review comprehensively summarizes recent advances in APDs and their nanomedicines, from the rationale and the stimuli-responsive linker chemistry for on-demand drug release to their progress to the clinics, clinical performance of APDs, as well as the challenges and perspective on future development."
"astasis (LM) occurs in various cancers, and its early and accurate diagnosis is of great importance. However, the detection of small LMs is still a great challenge because of the subtle differences between normal liver tissue and small metastases. Herein, we prepare glutathione (GSH)-responsive hyaluronic acid-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (HIONPs) for highly sensitive diagnosis of LMs through a facile one-pot method. HIONPs greatly enhance the signal of MRI in tumor metastases as T1 contrast agent (CA), whereas they substantially decrease the signal of liver as T2 CA as they aggregate into clusters upon the high GSH in liver. Consequently, MRI contrasted by HIONPs clearly distinguishes metastatic tumors (bright) from surrounding liver tissues (dark). HIONPs with superior LM contrasting capability and facile synthesis are very promising for clinical translation and indicate a new strategy to develop an ultrasensitive MRI CA for LM diagnosis that exploits high GSH level in the liver."
"Hypoxia is one of the critical features in solid tumors, and hypoxia-targeting contrast agents (CAs) could greatly enhance the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of tumors by increasing its specificity and providing more diagnosis information. In this article, an internally hydroxy dendrimer of high molecular weight was facilely synthesized by ""epoxy-amine"" and ""thiol-ene"" reactions with a β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) as the core, and a hypoxia-targeting dendritic contrast agent (DCA) was synthesized through conjugating Gd chelates onto the internal hydroxyl groups and grafting the hypoxia-targeting groups sulfonamides and zwitterionic groups onto the exterior groups of the dendrimer. The zwitterionic surface without disturbance from internally conjugated CAs could reduce unspecific cellular uptake by normal cells, while the hypoxia-targeting group mediate the cellular uptake by hypoxic tumor cells. The in vitro and in vivo study showed that the hypoxia-targeting DCA could be selectively uptake by hypoxic cancer cells and greatly enhance the MRI of orthotopic breast tumor in a mouse model."
"tidentate amine ligand, 1,3,5-tris[(3-dimethylamino)propyl]-hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine (T-triazine) was developed for the atom transfer radical polymerization of methacrylates (dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA)). It was found that with T-triazine as ligand, CuBr mediated a living polymerization of DMAEMA and MMA, producing polymers with controlled molecular weight and narrow polydispersity. The DMAEMA bulk polymerization and MMA solution polymerization in THF and γ-butyrolactone (γBL) followed first order kinetics with respect to the monomer. At lower temperature, both polymerizations had an induction period and the induction time decreased with increasing temperature. The measured apparent active energy was 67.8 kJ/mol for DMAEMA polymerization. The NMR spectra confirmed that the polymerizations proceeded via an atom transfer radical process."
"onductive polypyrrole (PPy) with room temperature conductivity (2–18 S/cm) has been synthesized by doping polypyrrole with mixed acid containing camphor sulfonic acid (CSA) and dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA). The solubility and the room temperature conductivity of PPy doped with mixed acid were measured as a function of component of CSA–DBSA mixed acid, and the structure of PPy was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), ultraviolet–visible (UV-vis) spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). PPy doped with DBSA–CSA mixed acid is soluble in m-cresol although PPy doped only by CSA is completely insoluble in any solvent. The solubility of PPy doped with mixed acid increases with an increase in the fraction of DBSA in the mixed acid, while the room temperature conductivity of the PPy increases with increasing CSA molar fraction. The UV-vis spectra and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements showed that both polaron and bipolaron are the charge carrier in the doped PPy with mixed acid. It was proposed that the contribution of CSA to the solubility of PPy doped with mixed acid is to decrease the interaction among PPy chains due to the large molecular size of CSA, while DBSA contributes to the solubility by its good solvating effect derived from its long alkyl chain. These may be a reason that both the solubility and conductivity of PPy are improved by the presence of CSA compared with those of PPy doped only with DBSA. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

"The application of nonviral gene vectors has been limited by their insufficient transfection efficiency because of poor serum stability, high endosomal entrapment, limited intracellular release, and low accumulation in the targeted organelle. It is still challenging to design gene carriers with properties that can overcome all of the barriers. We previously developed a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive cationic polymer, poly[(2-acryloyl)ethyl( p-boronic acid benzyl) diethylammonium bromide] (B-PDEAEA), which switches the charge at high concentrations of intracellular ROS to promote intracellular DNA release. However, its gene-delivery efficiency has been limited by serum instability and lysosomal trapping, and coating with an anionic PEGylated lipid only showed mild enhancement. Herein, we coated the ROS-responsive B-PDEAEA polymer with two cationic lipids to form ROS-responsive lipopolyplexes with integrated properties to overcome multiple delivery barriers. The surface cationic lipids endowed the nanocarrier with improved serum stability, effective cellular uptake, and lysosomal evasion. The interior B-PDEAEA/DNA polyplexes, which were highly stable in the extracellular environment, but quickly dissociated, released DNA, promoted nuclei localization, and achieved efficient transcription. The mechanisms of the ROS-responsive and charge-switchable properties of B-PDEAEA were quantitatively studied. The transfection efficiency and antitumor activity of lipopolyplexes were studied in vitro and in vivo. We found that the ROS-responsive lipopolyplexes effectively delivered therapeutic genes into cell nuclei and caused high tumor inhibition in mice bearing peritoneal or lung metastases."

"enimine (PEI) is the most widely applied polymeric vector in gene delivery. However, its therapeutic application is hampered by the high cytotoxicity and poor in vivo transfection efficiency. We constructed a mannosylated, bioreducible hybrid of low-molecular-weight PEI and cell-penetrating peptide (termed Man-PEI5k–CPP) as a vector to deliver plasmid TRAIL (pTRAIL) for colorectal cancer treatment. We discovered that the colon cancer cells overexpressed mannose receptors (MR). With the combined functions of the tumor-targeting ligand and the CPP, the Man-PEI5k–CPP not only increased the cellular uptake efficiency, but also improved the efficiency of transfection, thus yielding enhanced inhibition efficacy on HCT116 human colon cancer cells, compared to the conventional PEI25k. The animal studies further confirmed the treatment success of Man-PEI5k–CPP/pTRAIL in the mice bearing xenografted HCT116 tumors and showed minimal systemic toxicity."

"Camptothecin (CPT) nanosuspension was prepared by anti-solvent precipitation with TPGS as stabilizer to improve the solubility, stability and antitumor activity of CPT. And an increased solubility, stability and dissolution rate was achieved after nanosuspension being prepared. While, enhanced intracellular accumulation and cellular cytotoxicity was also observed for CPT nanosuspension than that of CPT solution.In addition, nanosuspension could increase bioavailability and intratumor accumulation of CPT in vivo after intravenous administration, and then produced a much higher antitumor effect and biocompatibility than that of CPT solution. Meanwhile, an enhanced cellular CPT uptake in hypoxic or acid conditions could also be observed for nanosuspension. As a result, nanosuspension represents a potentially feasible formation for insoluble drug in antitumor research."
"Each of the currently used helical reconstruction algorithms represents one tradeoff selection of the image noise or mA requirement and resultant artifacts versus the width of the section profile. For many applications, the performance tradeoffs different from those existed are desired. In this paper, we present a general framework of incorporating the longitudinal (z) filtration in helical CT reconstruction, which leads to a new class of helical reconstruction algorithms with tunable performance characteristics to suit various applications. The z-filtering algorithm enables us to derive the performance curve of image noise or mA requirement versus the width of the section profile, whereas the existing helical reconstruction algorithms only represent limited discrete samples of the curve. We demonstrate that using a new helical reconstruction algorithm derived from this general framework, a substantial reduction in image noise or mA requirement can be achieved with a slight increase of FWHM of the section profile. Thus for many applications requiring both compact section profile and low image noise or mA requirement, the new algorithm represents a better tradeoff than both the 180 degrees and 360 degrees interpolation algorithms. The new algorithm also offers the following potential clinical benefits: (1) longer x-ray tube life; (2) longer scan duration with less x-ray tube cooling delays--longer volume coverage and/or longer thin-slice scan; (3) less radiation to patient; (4) less image noise; and (5) less helical artifacts. Initial clinical results are also presented."

"Small molecular prodrugs that self-assemble into nanoparticles have many advantages over commonly studied nanomedicines based upon nanoscale carriers such as liposomes, micelles and polymeric nanoparticles. These carrier-free nanodrugs exhibit favorable nanoproperties without the help of a nanocarrier, and they have many unique merits, such as a simple synthetic procedure, well-defined structure and high drug loading capacity. To date, most of these carrier-free nanodrugs have been spherical and very few nonspherical nanodrugs have been synthesized and studied. Herein, we report a camptothecin (CPT) prodrug that self-assembles into nanofibers. These carrier-free CPT nanofibers have a width of approximately one hundred nanometers and a length of several micrometers. The cellular uptake and tumor penetration behaviour of these nanofibers were observed by time-lapse video microscopy. These nanofibers can rapidly enter cancer cells by penetrating the cell membrane, gradually dissolve intracellularly and efficiently release the active drug. Coating the surface of these nanofibers with a pH-responsive PEG layer improves the stability of these nanofibers and shields their positive charge to minimize nonspecific interactions. These pH-responsive nanofibers are sheddable in the acidic tumor microenvironment and deliver carried cargoes deep into tumors. Our findings demonstrate that small molecular CPT prodrugs that form nanofibers are efficient for cancer drug delivery."
"the knowledge that cationic polymers with different topographical structures behave differently in gene transfection process, herein, we synthesized three biodegradable poly(amido amine)s (PAAs) with the same repeating units and molecular weights except for degree of branching: linear PAA (LPAA), low‐branched PAA (LBPAA), and high‐branched PAA (HBPAA). We found that LBPAA could more effectively compact pDNA into positively charged nanoparticles than both HBPAA and LPAA. LBPAA polyplexes had the highest transfection efficiency among the three PAA polyplexes, and the difference in transfection efficiency is mainly attributed to the endocytosis rate. The cytotoxicity of PAAs was negligible at the transfection doses, probably due to the degradable disulfide bonds. Therefore, we could use branching as a parameter to simply tune a polymer's cellular uptake behavior and transfection efficiency. Biotechnol.

"Polymer gels can be classified as chemical and physical gels, depending on the type of cross-link. Physical gels usually form by physical cross-linking, such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals and/or p-p interactions, which can avoid the use of additional cross-linking agents. Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers possess abundant active groups on their surfaces. Modified dendrimers have been used as versatile linkers in some projects. In this work, polymer gels composed of PAMAM dendrimers without any covalent bonding cross-linking agents were prepared. The number of amino groups and ester groups on the surface of the dendrimers was precisely regulated to help form hydrogen bonds between adjacent dendrimers. The prepared dendrimer-based polymer gels retain the properties of PAMAM dendrimers such as antibacterial properties, and the unique structures make the gels exhibit high compressive strengths but relatively low tensile strengths. Interestingly, the prepared gels show good anti-inflammatory properties in acute inflammation models of mice with ear edema. The inflammatory inhibition rate and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining method were used to confirm the anti-inflammatory effect. This present study demonstrates that the dendrimer-based polymer gels achieved through hydrogen bonding could be a versatile platform for tissue engineering."
"Gene therapy has shown promise in antitumor strategies for advanced cancer. However, efficient and safe delivery of potent therapeutic gene expressing in specific tumor tissues remains elusive, especially when there exist stromal obstacles. Here we report a non-viral gene delivery approach targeting pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) as the transfection host in the fibroblast-enriched tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer. Plasmid DNA (pDNA) encapsulated in branched polyethylenemine (BPEI) was found to selectively transfect PSCs rather than pancreatic cancer cells and other fibroblast cell lines. Mechanism investigations reveal that the highly expressed fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) in PSCs facilitated the cellular uptake of polyplexes in PSCs. This delivery platform carrying gene encoding of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) displayed effective by-stander effect and tumor cell-selective cytotoxicity. More importantly, the therapeutic efficacy was proved in a PSC-enriched orthotopic pancreatic tumor model. Thus, this gene delivery strategy smartly converts PSCs as the microenvironment obstacle for drug delivery into the producer and reservoir of selective tumor-killing proteins."
"Multi-target drugs have gained considerable attention in the last decade owing to their advantages in the treatment of complex diseases and health conditions linked to drug resistance. Single-target drugs, although highly selective, may not necessarily have better efficacy or fewer side effects. Therefore, more attention is being paid to developing drugs that work on multiple targets at the same time, but developing such drugs is a huge challenge for medicinal chemists. Each target must have sufficient activity and have sufficiently characterized pharmacokinetic parameters. Multi-target drugs, which have long been known and effectively used in clinical practice, are briefly discussed in the present article. In addition, in this review, we will discuss the possible applications of multi-target ligands to guide the repositioning of prospective drugs."
"l, an expensive first-line anticancer drug, is known to have better pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy if encapsulated in polymeric micelles. However, the conventional encapsulation methods using incompressible aqueous solutions are limited to low drug loading, less than 3% of micelle weight, and low efficiency, more than two-thirds of the drug in solution remains unencapsulated, and hence wasted, not to mention the burst release problems. This work demonstrates that expansion of near-critical fluid solutions, for example in compressible dimethyl ether and trifluoromethane not too far from their critical region, can lead to a much higher drug loading, for example in micelles formed from poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(e-caprolactone) (PEG-b-PCL). By controlling the drug precipitation within the micellar solution region, the loading of paclitaxel in PEG-b-PCL can reach over 12% with a loading efficiency of 87%, which is unattainable by conventional methods. Moreover, the burst release frac..."
"Cisplatin conjugated onto macromolecules or loaded in micelles can be preferentially delivered to tumors to minimize its toxicity to healthy tissues and increase its drug efficacy. Herein, we report cisplatin-containing nanogels possibly useful for targeted delivery of cisplatin. Carboxylic acid-functionalized poly(beta -aminoester)graft-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymers were synthesized by cocondensation polymerization of piperazine with 2,2-bis(acryloxymethyl)propionic acid, PEG 2,2-bis(acryloxymethyl)propionate macromonomer (mPEG). The graft copolymers formed 100-200 nm nanogels with low size-distribution by the complexation of their carboxylic groups with cisplatin. The nanogels were negatively charged and had a PEG outer layer. Thus, they had ""stealth properties"" suitable for in vivo applications. The nanogels had significantly lower in vitro cytotoxicity to SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells than free cisplatin, but similar anticancer activity toward SKOV-3 tumors xenografted to immunocompromised mice."
"ange in a typical dynamic covalent polymer network allows access to macroscopic shape reconfigurability, but the network architecture is not altered. An opposite possibility is that the network architecture can be designed to switch to various topological states corresponding to different material properties. Achieving both in one network can expand the material scope, but their intrinsically conflicting mechanisms make it challenging. We design a dynamic covalent network that can undergo two orthogonal topological transformations, namely transesterification on the branched chains and olefin metathesis on the mainframe. This allows independent control of the macroscopic shape and molecular architecture. With this design, we illustrate a bottlebrush network with programmable shape and spatially definable mechanical properties. Our strategy paves a way to on-demand regulation of network polymers."

"polymers dynamically complex DNA into complexes (polyplexes). So, upon dilution, polyplexes easily dissociate and lose transfection ability, limiting their in vivo systemic gene delivery. Herein, it is found that polyplex's stability and endocytosis pathway determine its transfection dose‐dependence. The polyplexes of hydrophilic polycations have dose‐dependent integrity and lysosome‐trafficking endocytosis; at low doses, most of these polyplexes dissociate, and the remaining few are internalized and trapped in lysosomes, abolishing their transfection ability. In contrast, the polyplexes of the polycations with optimal hydrophobicity remain integrated even at low concentrations and enter cells via macropinocytosis directly into the cytosol evading lysosomes, so each polyplex can accomplish its infection process, leading to dose‐independent DNA transfection like viral vectors. Furthermore, the tuned hydrophobicity balancing the affinity of anionic poly(γ‐glutamic acid) (γ‐PGA) to the polyplex surface enables γ‐PGA to stick on the polyplex surface as a shielding layer but peel off on the cell membrane to release the naked polyplexes for dose‐independent transfection. These findings may provide guidelines for developing polyplexes that mimick a viral vector's dose‐independent transfection for effective in vivo gene delivery."
"Calcium phosphate (CaP) nanoparticles present a class of promising nonviral gene delivery carriers due to their easy-preparation procedure, low toxicity and high transfection efficiency. PEGylated polyanion block copolymer was widely used to control the CaP crystal growth during CaP co-precipitation with therapeutic genes. However, there also exists a competition between the entrapped gene and polyanion in the system, which results in reduced stability and low gene entrapment efficiency. To solve this problem, herein, we demonstrate a non-anion stabilization strategy using a boroxole-containing block polymer, PEG-b-poly(benzoxaborole) (PEG-PBO), which forms pH-responsive boronic ester bonds with ribose rings of siRNA and also excellently adhers to the hydroxyapatite surface of CaP. The PEG-PBO/siRNA/CaP nanocomposites exhibited high siRNA loading efficiency, low cell cytotoxicity and excellent colloidal stability at neutral pH. The nanocomposites easily entered cancer cells mainly via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and transferred into acidic lysosomes, where the boronic esters broke, nanoparticles dissociated, and siRNA released and escaped from lysosomes. PEG-PBO/siRNA/CaP nanocomposites showed significantly higher gene silencing efficacy than lipofectamine 2000/siRNA lipoplex in multiple cancer cells. Thus, PEG-PBO/siRNA/CaP nanocomposites possess potential for safe and effective siRNA delivery."
"erization of N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) under atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) conditions was studied. The ligand, solvent (water, n-butanol, and toluene), initiator, and Cu halide were varied. High monomer conversions were obtained using the Me4Cyclam ligand. Polymerizations in water that were initiated at room temperature were complete within minutes. However, none of the experimental conditions produced a controlled polymerization. This conclusion is based on broad molecular weight distributions, poor agreement between theoretical and experimental Mn, incremental monomer addition experiments, and end group analysis. We believe that the Cu salts complex to the amide group of the chain ends and stabilize the radical. This stabilization retards the deactivation step in ATRP and produces an unacceptably high concentration of radicals which leads to spontaneous termination reactions. In addition, we have indirect evidence for a cyclization reaction involving nucleophilic Br displacemen..."
"Polysaccharide-based nanocarriers (PBNs) are the focus of extensive investigation because of their biocompatibility, low cost, wide availability, and chemical versatility, which allow a wide range of anticancer agents to be loaded within the nanocarriers. Similar to other nanocarriers, most PBNs are designed to extravasate out of tumor vessels, depending on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, the EPR effect is compromised in some tumors due to the heterogeneity of tumor structures. Transvascular transport efficacy is decreased by complex blood vessels and condensed tumor stroma. The limited extravasation impedes efficient drug delivery into tumor parenchyma, and thus affects the subsequent tumor accumulation, which hinders the therapeutic effect of PBNs. Therefore, overcoming the biological barriers that restrict extravasation from tumor vessels is of great importance in PBN design. Many strategies have been developed to enhance the EPR effect that involve nanocarrier property regulation and tumor structure remodeling. Moreover, some researchers have proposed active transcytosis pathways that are complementary to the paracellular EPR effect to increase the transvascular extravasation efficiency of PBNs. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the design of PBNs with enhanced transvascular transport to enable optimization of PBNs in the extravasation of the drug delivery process. We also discuss the obstacles and challenges that need to be addressed to clarify the transendothemial mechanism of PBNs and the potential interactions between extravasation and other drug delivery steps."

"Traditional and single treatment strategies are difficult to achieve good results due to tumor resistance and complex mechanisms. Combination therapy through co-delivery systems is one of the methods to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatment. The polyprodrug platform has inherent advantages such as high drug loading and strong stability. Herein, a new reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive micelle composed of poly 10-hydroxycamptothecin (pHCPT) and PEG is reported, which loaded dexamethasone (DEX) as synergistic drugs. The micelles collapse in the complex microenvironment of tumor cells to release DEX. The first released DEX can increase the ROS level of tumor cells, thereby facilitating the cleavage of thioketal bonds to release intact HCPT molecules. Meanwhile, DEX can normalize tumor blood vessels, reduce adverse reactions, and further improve the efficacy of HCPT. This co-delivery system shows an ideal tumor suppressive effect in vivo and in vitro. Designing drugs into a modular multi-drug platform and selecting appropriate synergistic drugs according to the treatment plan provides a convenient strategy for future clinical treatment."
" have a wide range of application in the field of biomedicine, flexible electronics and bionics. In this study, injectable and self-healable hydrogels were firstly prepared based on dynamic covalent C=C bond formed via Knoevenagel condensation reaction between poly(ethylene glycol) dicyanoacetate and water-soluble poly(vanillin acrylate). Three kinds of catalysts for Knoevenagel condensation (phosphate buffer, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 and tertiary amine) were used to prepare hydrogels. All hydrogels in this study could be formed in-situ and gelation time ranged from seconds to minutes. The properties and application of hydrogels could be customizable according to the type of catalyst. MTT results indicated that all components, as well as hydrogels had low-toxic and hydrogels could be used as 3D cell culture scaffold. Due to the dynamic covalent C=C bond formed by Knoevenagel condensation, the resultant hydrogels were dynamic and showed good self-healing properties. This work finds a new dynamic covalent chemistry for preparation of self-healable materials."
"Anticancer treatment has become a research highlight in recent years. Despite several techniques have been developed and applied in the clinic, this area still meets great challenges in the construction of smart anticancer devices with accurate targeting, controlled release and microenvironment response properties. Most of the carbon-based materials are biocompatible, possessing abundant and tunable pore structures and particularly large surface areas. These properties make them suitable materials as drug carriers. In addition, some carbon-based materials are capable of absorbing near-infrared radiation (NIR) and have highly efficient photothermal effects. The generated heat in situ can be used to kill cancer cells in short time on the position. This review describes the recent and significant application of four kinds of carbon materials including carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon dots and mesoporous carbon for drug delivery and photothermal therapy. After a short introduction of the structures and properties of these materials, the construction and application of these nanoplatforms in drug delivery, photothermal therapy or their combination will be summarized and discussed in depth. In addition, other carbon allotropes as drug carriers will be introduced briefly. Finally, the risk assessments and the perspectives and challenges of these materials used in cancer therapies are enclosed."

"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating disorder, leading to permanent motor and sensory deficit. Despite recent advances in neurosciences, the treatment efficacy on SCI patients remains unsatisfactory, mainly due to the poor accumulation, short retention, and lack of controlled release of therapeutics in lesion tissue. Herein, an injured spinal cord targeting prodrug polymer micelle is built. An esterase-responsive bond is used to link apocynin (APO) monomer, because of the enhanced esterase activity found in microglia cells after activation, which ensures a controlled degradation of APO prodrug (Allyloxypolyethyleneglycol-b-poly [2-(((4-acetyl-2-methoxyphenoxy)carbonyl)oxy)ethyl methacrylate], APEG-PAPO or PAPO) by activated microglia cells. A scar tissue-homing peptide (cysteine-alanine-glutamine-lysine, CAQK) is introduced to the PAPO to endow the polymer micelle the lesion tissue-targeting ability. As a result, this CAQK-modified prodrug micelle (cPAM) exhibits an improved accumulation and prolonged retention in lesion tissue compared to the control micelle. The cPAM also leads to superior tissue protection and sustained motor function recovery than the control groups in a mouse model of SCI. In conclusion, the cPAM induces an effective treatment of SCI by the lesion tissue specific delivery of the prodrug polymer via its robust scar binding effect, making the scar tissue a drug releasing platform for sustained treatment of SCI."

"Multifunctional nanomedicines featuring high drug loading capacity, controllable drug release and real-time self-monitoring are attracting increasing attention due to their potential to improve cancer therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a new kind of Fe3O4@C-based nanoparticles modified with isoreticular metal organic frameworks (IRMOF-3), folic acid (FA) and detachable polyethylene glycol (PEG) under tumor microenvironment was developed. The core-shell structured Fe3O4@C was synthesized via the one-pot solvothermal reaction and the IRMOF-3 layers were coated on the outer shell of Fe3O4@C through layer-by-layer coating method. The FA and PEG were conjugated on the surface of nanoparticles by reacting with the amine groups provided by IRMOF-3. The as-synthesized nanoparticles showed stable photothermal effect, superparamagnetic properties and blue fluorescence characteristic under 360 nm irradiation. The in vitro experiments showed that the drug loaded nanoparticles exhibit pH-dependent drug release property, and PEGylation was proved effective in suppressing burst drug release (only 8.0% of drugs were released within 95 h). The confocal laser scanning microscopy study revealed that the as-synthesized nanoparticles could serve as a cell imaging agent and the cell internalization can be significantly enhanced after FA modified. The IRMOF-3 modified nanoparticles showed negligible cytotoxicity and the drug loaded nanoparticles showed pH/photothermal-stimuli enhanced cytotoxicity in vitro. It is believed that the present smart drug delivery platforms will hold great potential in imaging guided drug delivery and cancer therapy."
"esponsive dendrimers are attractive nanocarriers for cancer drug delivery due to their inherent structure, biodegradability and precise control of release of a payload in response to specific triggers. However, the efficient and precise synthesis of such dendrimers with site-specific responsiveness is challenging. We report an efficient synthesis of enzyme-responsive phosphoramidate (PAD) dendrimers from a pair of monomers using click and click-like reactions. These dendrimers were stable in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) but degradable in the presence of phospholipase C (PLC) that was overexpressed on cancer cells. The surface modification of the dendrimers with zwitterionic groups (2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine, MPC) greatly reduced the nonspecific binding of the plasma proteins and therefore enhanced blood circulation time. The PAD-MPC dendrimers easily encapsulated hydrophobic drugs such as doxorubicin (DOX). The DOX-loaded PAD-MPC (PAD-MPC/DOX) showed PLC-responsive drug release and efficient delivery of DOX to cancer cells by overcoming multidrug resistance.

"lymerization of trimethylene carbonate (TMC) and D,L-lactide (D,L-LA) was conducted at 80°C using rare earth chloride as catalyst. The copolymerization reaction showed an induction period. The effects of reaction time and temperature were examined. The polymerization activity of various rare earth chlorides was in the order: LaCl3>YCl3, PrCl3>NdCl3≥DyCl3. The copolymer was characterized by 1H NMR. The reactivity ratios of TMC and D,L-LA were determined by the Fineman-Ross and Kelen-Tüdös methods."

"Cisplatin (CDDP) is a potent first-line antitumor drug but suffers severe side effects and poor pharmacokinetics. Its complexation with polycarboxylic acids, such as polyglutamic acids, is generally used to fabricate nanoformulations for CDDP delivery; however, the multiple strong complexations makes intracellular drug release slow. Herein, we report a novel polyphenol-metal coordination method to fabricate CDDP-incorporated core-shell nanoparticles, which are stable in blood circulation but dissociate in the tumor. Methoxyl-PEG terminated with one or two gallic acids (PEG-GA or PEG-GA2) complexed CDDP and produced well-defined nanoparticles (PEG-GAx/Pt) with CDDP loading contents as high as 17.7% to 29.8%. The PEG-GAx/Pt nanoparticles were very stable in the physiological conditions and had slow blood clearance and efficient tumor accumulation, but dissociated quickly and released CDDP in response to the tumor acidity or elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). PEG-GAx/Pt nanoparticles exhibited improved antitumor efficiency against 4 T1 breast cancer and A549 lung carcinoma with much-reduced toxicity compared to free CDDP. The work demonstrates a new strategy of cisplatin-polyphenol coordination for developing platinum drugs' nanomedicines."
"Breakthroughs in molecular mechanisms underlying immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment and paradigm shifts in the cancer-immunity response cycle have profoundly changed the landscape of cancer immunotherapy. However, one of the challenges is to mitigate the serious side effects caused by systemic autoimmunity and autoinflammatory responses following immunotherapy. Thus, restraining the activation of the immune system in healthy tissues is highly desirable to address this problem. Bioengineering and delivery technologies provide a solution to the issue. In this Review, we first introduce immune-related adverse effects of main immunotherapies and the underlying mechanisms, summarize strategies of designingde bioengineering and delivery systems to reduce their immunotoxicities, and highlight the importance of the development of immunotoxicity-related animal models."

"Effective delivery is the primary barrier against the clinical translation of gene therapy. Yet there remains too much unknown in the gene delivery mechanisms, even for the most investigated polymeric carrier (i.e., PEI). As a consequence, the conflicting results have been often seen in the literature due to the large variability in the experimental conditions and operations. Therefore, some key parameters should be identified and thus strictly controlled in the formulation process. Methods: The effect of the formulation processing parameters (e.g., concentration or mixture volume) and the resulting nanostructure properties on gene transfection have been rarely investigated. Two types of the PEI/DNA nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared in the same manner with the same dose but at different concentrations. The microstructure of the NPs and the transfection mechanisms were investigated through various microscopic methods. The therapeutic efficacy of the NPs was demonstrated in the cervical subcutaneous xenograft and peritoneal metastasis mouse models. Results: The high-concentration process (i.e., small reaction-volume) for mixture resulted in the large-sized PEI/DNA NPs that had a higher efficiency of gene transfection, compared to the small counterpart that was prepared at a low concentration. The microstructural experiments showed that the prepared small NPs were firmly condensed, whereas the large NPs were bulky and botryoid-shaped. The large NPs entered the tumor cells via the macropinocytosis pathway, and then efficiently dissociated in the cytoplasm and released DNA, thus promoting the intranuclear delivery. The enhanced in vivo therapeutic efficacy of the large NPs was demonstrated, indicating the promise for local-regional administration. Conclusion: This work provides better understanding of the effect of formulation process on nano-structural properties and gene transfection, laying a theoretical basis for rational design of the experimental process."

"r describes the combination of silica-coated, analyte-tagged gold nanoparticles (SA@GNPs) and gold-coated paramagnetic nanoparticles (Au@MNPs) in a sandwich assay for the surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of cancer-related serum microRNA, miRNA 141. The target sequence is captured by hybridization reactions with complementary oligonucleotide probes conjugated to the SA@GNPs and Au@MNPs, respectively. The resultant hybridization complexes, SA@GNP/miRNA 141/Au@MNP, are removed from solution by using an external magnet. Laser excitation of the concentrated complexes provides a SERS signature spectrum diagnostic for the analyte molecules embedded in the SA@GNPs and specific to the target sequence, miRNA 141. The limit of detection (LOD) for target sequences in serum was 1.8 pM, which is lower by a factor of ∼110 than the previously reported LOD in a similar magnetic-based SERS assay using uncoated, Raman-tagged GNPs as SERS nanotags, which have been demonstrated to suffer signal loss due to the serum protein displacement of Raman analyte molecules on the surface. These results indicate that silica coating plays an essential role in preventing disassociation of Raman reporters from the GNPs, allowing more quantitative and reproducible detection of serum miRNAs than conventional uncoated SERS nanotags."

"ers have been employed extensively to enhance drug delivery efficacy and reduce the side effect. However, carrier materials for drug delivery have challenging aspects, including safety concerns, low drug content, complexity in preparation, and low reproducibility. Herein, we propose a facile, universal, and green preparation way to use natural polyphenols to build platinum nanocomplex with stable structure, proper size, and high Pt content. The nanocomplexes are constructed by metal-polyphenol coordination using natural polyphenols and 1,2-diaminocyclohexane-Pt (II), enabling dual-responsive drug release behavior. For proof of concept, we demonstrate the antitumor activity of the Pt nanocomplex using a representative tannic acid-Pt nanocomplex (denoted as PTI). PTI can induce intensive tumor cell apoptosis, trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD), remarkably promote cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) infiltration in tumors, and significantly reduce immunosuppression of the tumor microenvironments, thus stimulating potent antitumor immune responses and showing effective antitumor activity by synergizing immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy."
"Celastrol, a natural triterpene extracted from traditional Chinese medicine, shows anticancer effects on various cancer cells. However, its poor water-solubility, short plasma half-life, and high systemic toxicity impede its applications in vivo, necessitating a stable drug delivery system to overcome these critical drawbacks. We present here a block copolymer, poly(2-(N-oxide-N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (OPDMA-HEMA), as the carrier for celastrol delivery. The amphiphilic polymer-celastrol conjugate can self-assemble into nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The OPDMA outer shell confers the nanoparticles with improved pharmacokinetics and efficient mitochondria targeting capacity, and profoundly potentiates celastrol's induction of immunogenic cell death, which collectively contribute to the enhanced therapeutic effects of celastrol in vivo. This mitochondria-targeted polymer-celastrol conjugate may promise the applications of celastrol in cancer treatment."

NIR imaging is advantageous because of its merits like deep tissue penetration, minimum damage to the tissue, reduced auto fluorescence from the background, and improved resolution in imaging. The Development of the NIR emitting probe was well explored recently and growing drastically. In this review, we summarise recent achievements in NIR probes in between 2018-2021. The merits and future applications have also been discussed in this review."
"Cationic polymers condense nucleic acids into nanosized complexes (polyplexes) that are widely explored for nonviral gene delivery, but their strong electrostatic binding with DNA causes inefficient intracellular gene release and translation and thereby unsatisfactory gene transfection efficiencies. Facilitated intracellular dissociation of polyplexes by making the polymer undergo positive-to-negative/neutral charge reversal can effectively solve these problems, but they must be sufficiently stable during the delivery. Herein, we report the first glutathione (GSH)-specific intracellular labile polyplexes for cancer-targeted gene delivery. The polymers are made from p-(2,4-dinitrophenyloxybenzyl)-ammonium cationic moieties, whose p-2,4-dinitrophenyl ether is cleaved specifically by GSH, rather than other biological thiols, triggering the conversion of the ammonium cation into the carboxylate anion and thus the fast intracellular DNA release of the polyplexes. Furthermore, the polyplexes coated with PEG-functionalized lipids are stable in biological fluids to gain long blood circulation for tumor accumulation. Thus, the efficient tumor accumulation and cell transfection of the polyplexes loaded with the tumor suicide gene tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) give rise to potent antitumor activity similar to that of the first-line chemotherapy drug paclitaxel but with much less adverse effects."
"Modification of drug delivery systems (DDSs) with stimuli-responsive elements could significantly increase the tumor-specific delivery of anticancer drugs. Herein we synthesized a novel multiple stimuli-responsive SN38 prodrug, named PEG-S-S-SN38, by conjugating PEG (MW: 2000) and SN38 with disulfide bonds and carbonic ester linkages as linkers for efficient delivery of SN38. The amphiphilic PEG-S-S-SN38, with a high SN38 loading content, could self-assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) with a stable diameter of ∼73 nm. PEG-S-S-SN38 NPs release SN38 very slowly at physiological pH, while they quickly release SN38 in the presence of GSH, esterase and H2O2, all of which are abundant in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. PEG-S-S-SN38 NPs could be quickly internalized into tumor cells, achieve vesicular escape and nuclear localization, and exhibit remarkable in vitro anticancer activity similar to SN38. Encouragingly, PEG-S-S-SN38 NPs exhibit the same effects on cell cycle regulations as SN38 in vitro. Most importantly, the inhibition rate of tumor growth induced by PEG-S-S-SN38 NPs in a xenograft tumor model reached 72.49% ± 6.26%, which was nearly double that of the corresponding clinical drug CPT-11 (38.64% ± 13.04%) at a dosage equivalent to 10 mg kg-1 SN38. Our data suggest that the multi-stimuli responsiveness of PEG-S-S-SN38 NPs remarkably enhances their therapeutic activity against heterogeneous or mixed cell population in tumors, making this new DDS a promising alternative to CPT-11 for cancer treatment."
"chuic acid (3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid; PCA) is a well-known antioxidant compound and a potential antitumor drug that is commonly found in fruits and vegetables. This article describes the development of novel biodegradable dendrimers that contain PCA as a building block. The structures of the dendrimers were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, gel permeation chromatography, and matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. PCA dendrimers could serve as potential anticancer drugs and also as nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery. PCA dendrimers can easily be loaded with hydrophobic drugs such as doxorubicin that benefit from the binding interaction between PCA and the drug. Doxorubicin-loaded PCA dendrimers exhibited pH and redox-dual responsive drug release in vitro. The antitumor effect of PCA dendrimers to which polyethylene glycol polymer chains have been attached and doxorubicin-loaded dendrimers was preliminarily evaluated both in vitro and in vivo."
"ceptor‐mediated targeted drug delivery has been widely recognized as a promising strategy for improving the clinical efficacy of nanomedicines but is attenuated by the binding of plasma protein on the surface of nanoparticles to form a protein corona. Here, it is shown that ultrasonic cavitation can be used to unravel surface plasma coronas on liposomal nanoparticles through ultrasound (US)‐induced liposomal reassembly. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, transcytosis‐targeting‐peptide‐decorated reconfigurable liposomes (LPGLs) loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and perfluoropentane (PFP) are developed for cancer‐targeted therapy. In the blood circulation, the targeting peptides are deactivated by the plasma corona and lose their targeting capability. Once they reach tumor blood vessels, US irradiation induces transformation of the LPGLs from nanodrops into microbubbles via liquid–gas phase transition and decorticate the surface corona by reassembly of the lipid membrane. The activated liposomes regain the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization, initiate ligand/receptor‐mediated transcytosis, achieve efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and lead to potent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models of patient‐derived tumor xenografts. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the fluid biological barriers of the protein corona and develop transcytosis‐targeting liposomes for active tumor transport and efficient cancer therapy."

"Conventional photothermal therapy (PTT) is insufficient to induce a strong and potent anti-tumor immune response. Herein, we present a vanadyl nanocomplex, which simultaneously serves as a photothermal agent (PTA) and an immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer to enhance the anti-tumor immunity of PTT. The vanadyl nanocomplex (STVN) is constructed via facile one-step coordination assembly under ambient conditions. STVN not only has a strong and stable photothermal effect under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, but also can cause severe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by itself, leading to ICD and activating the systemic immune responses. In the absence of any adjuvants, NIR-irradiated STVN almost completely ablates primary tumors and simultaneously inhibits distant tumors in mice bearing bilateral melanoma. Meanwhile, the intratumorally injected STVN combined with NIR effectively suppressed melanoma lung metastasis as well as tumor recurrence, displaying that local STVN-mediated PTT could trigger a systemic anti-tumor immunity. Therefore, STVN, as a novel immunogenicity-enhanced PTA, affords a ""one stone two birds"" strategy for improved photothermia-induced cancer immunotherapy."

"y is an inherent fragrance attribute and typically implies a reduced perception over time. One possibility to elongate odor perception is utilizing controlled fragrance-delivery systems. Herein, the Y type of faujasite with different extra-framework cations (abbreviated as ZY, where Z represents Na+, Ca2+, or La3+) was examined as potential carriers for fragrance entrapment and delivery. d-Limonene (Lim) and linalool (Lol) as model fragrances were loaded in the pore space of Y zeolites, yielding composites FG@ZY (FG = Lim, Lol). It was found that the fragrance release profiles correlate highly with the cationic species located in the nonframework. The retention of fragrances in matrices increases in the order NaY < CaY < LaY for either limonene or linalool. Interestingly, the release rate of limonene was significantly slower than that of linalool when encapsulated in the same zeolite, although neat limonene has a much higher saturated vapor pressure than linalool. For instance, the total fraction of aroma released from Lim@LaY over 30 days was about 10%, while the value was ∼20% for Lol@LaY. Based on the density functional theory calculations, the above results could be well rationalized by the electrostatic attraction and shape selectivity of microporous matrices to the dopant molecules."
"In the last 2-3 decades, gene therapy represented a promising option for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. However, the design of safe and efficient gene delivery systems is still one of the major challenges that require solutions. In this study, we demonstrate a versatile method for covalent conjugation of glycyrrhizin acid (GL) or glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) to increase the transfection efficiency of Polyethyleneimine (PEI, Mw 1.8K) and improve their targeting abilities of hepatoma carcinoma cells. GA and GL targeting ligands were grafted to PEI via N-acylation, and we systematically investigated their biophysical properties, cytotoxicity, liver targeting and transfection efficiency, and endocytosis pathway trafficking. PEI-GA0.75, PEI-GL10.62 and PEI-GL20.65 conjugates caused significant increases in gene transfection efficiency and superior selectivity for HepG2 cells, with all three conjugates showing specific recognition of HepG2 cells by the free GA competition assay. The endocytosis inhibition and intracellular trafficking results indicated that PEI-GA0.75 and GL10.62 conjugates behaved similarly to SV40 virus, by proceeding via the caveolae- and clathrin-independent mediated endocytosis pathway and bypassing entry into lysosomes, with an energy independent manner, achieving their high transfection efficiencies. In the HepG2 intraperitoneal tumor model, PEI-GA0.75 and PEI-GL10.62 carrying the luciferase reporter gene gained high gene expression, suggesting potential use for in vivo application."
"Protein-polymer conjugation is a clinically validated approach to enhanced pharmacokinetic properties. However, the permanent attachment of polymers often leads to irreversibly reduced protein bioactivity and poor tissue penetration. As such, the use of protein-polymer conjugates for solid tumors remains elusive. Herein, we report a simple strategy using enzyme-activatable and size-shrinkable protein-polypeptide conjugates to overcome this clinical challenge. Briefly, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-responsive peptide sequence is introduced between a therapeutic protein interferon (IFN) and a synthetic polypeptide P(EG3Glu)20. The resulting site-specific MMP-responsive conjugate, denoted as PEP20-M-IFN, can, therefore, release the attached P(EG3Glu)20 to achieve both protein activation and deep penetration into the tumor microenvironment (TME). Compared to a similarly produced nonresponsive analogue conjugate PEP20-IFN, our results find PEP20-M-IFN to show higher bioactivity in vitro, improved tumor retention, and deeper penetration in a MMP2-dependent manner. Moreover, systemic administration of PEP20-M-IFN shows outstanding antitumor efficacy in both OVCAR3 and SKOV3 ovarian tumor models in mice. This work highlights the releasable PEPylation strategy for protein drug potentiation at the TME and opens up new opportunities in clinics for the treatment of malignant solid tumors."
"Polycation-based delivery presents a major method for non-viral gene therapy. However, the disadvantages of cationic vectors are their tendencies to be captured and eliminated by the reticuloendothelial system due to their excessive positive charges and nonspecific interaction with normal cells that leads to adverse effects. PEGylation was applied to solve these major problems. Yet, PEG chains can severely compromise cellular uptake and yield unsatisfying efficiency resulting in a so-called PEG dilemma. We developed a γ-PGA-based GGT-targeting and surface camouflage strategy by constructing a ternary complex system via a layer-by-layer self-assembly method. The biodegradable polyanion γ-PGA could protect the PEI/pDNA complexes from interaction with the body fluid components; however, in endosome, the polyanion facilitated the intracellular release of PEI/pDNA. The γ-PGA/PEI/pDNA nanoparticles possessed a markedly improved serum-tolerant capability. More importantly, γ-PGA interacts with the tumor-associated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) that can mediate endocytosis of the nanoparticles. With pTRAIL as the therapeutic gene, the γ-PGA/PEI/pTRAIL nanoparticles effectively inhibited tumor cell proliferation by inducing cell apoptosis and arresting cell cycles. The in vivo results displayed effective suppression of tumor growth, and high treatment efficacy in the mice bearing cervical tumor. The γ-PGA-based GGT-targeting and surface camouflage strategy is a potential method for improved gene delivery and cancer therapy."
"An inherent dilemma in the use of nanomedicines for cancer drug delivery is their limited penetration into tumors due to their large size. We have demonstrated that dendrimer/lipid nanoassemblies can solve this problem by means of tumor-triggered disassembly and the release of small (several nanometers) dendrimers to facilitate tumor penetration. Herein, we report a general strategy for the fabrication of nanoassemblies from hydrophobic and hydrophilic dendrimers with phospholipids. Hydrophobic dendrimers could assemble with lipids via hydrophobic interactions, whereas hydrophilic dendrimers could only assemble with lipids in the presence of anionic surfactants via both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The nanoassemblies of hydrophobic dendrimers/lipids were found to be capable of stripping off their lipid layers via fusion with the cell membrane and then intracellular or extracellular release of dendrimers, whereas the nanoassemblies of hydrophilic dendrimers/lipids were internalized via endocytosis and then released their dendrimers inside the cells. Therefore, these dendrimer/lipid nanoassemblies could be used for the delivery of different cancer drugs."

"Clinical development of 7-ethyl-10‑hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38), the active metabolite of irinotecan (CPT-11), is hindered by its insolubility and poor stability. Another obstacle is that tumors could become resistant to SN38/CPT-11 through multiple mechanisms involving breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Herein one of the most potent and selective BCRP inhibitors, Ko143, is encapsulated into a recently constructed prodrug PEG-S-S-SN38 displaying a high and fixed drug loading, multiple intratumoral stimuli (oxidative stress, GSH and esterase)-responsive drug release and significant in vitro and in vivo superiorities over CPT-11. The obtained ""combo"" for simultaneous delivery of SN38 and Ko143, named as BI@PEG-SN38, has a high SN38 loading efficacy (14.85 wt.%) and a good Ko143 encapsulation efficacy (3.79%). Through generating panels of human colorectal cancer models expressing altered levels of BCRP via lentiviral transfection and CRISPR-Cas9, characteristics of different drug formulations are carefully evaluated. Impressively, BI@PEG-SN38 nanoparticles effectively reverse chemoresistance to CPT-11 (resistance index dropping from ∼274.00-456.00 to ∼1.70-4.68) and PEG-S-S-SN38 (resistance index dropping from ∼5.83-14.00 to ∼1.70-4.68) in three BCRP-overexpressing cancer cell lines. More importantly, reversal of BCRP-mediated chemoresistance to CPT-11 (P values lower than 0.001-0.0001) and PEG-S-S-SN38 (P values lower than 0.01-0.001) by BI@PEG-SN38 nanoparticles are further confirmed with two panels of colorectal cancer xenograft models in vivo. As the first nano-formulation of Ko143 and the first systemic co-delivery vehicle of SN38/CPT-11 and a BCRP inhibitor, BI@PEG-SN38 provides a new approach for resolving the bottlenecks for clinical translation of SN38 and numerous ""chemosensitizers"" like Ko143, and exhibits promising applicability in precision cancer medicine. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: To resolve the bottlenecks in clinical application of anticancer agents SN38/CPT-11 and the most potent breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) inhibitor Ko143, a ""combo"" nanotherapeutic simultaneously delivering SN38 and Ko143 was constructed and named as BI@PEG-SN38. By generating panels of colorectal cancer models, we demonstrate that BI@PEG-SN38 nanoparticles effectively and selectively reversed BCRP-mediated tumor resistance to SN38/CPT-11 in vitro and in vivo. As the first nano-formulation of Ko143 and the first systemic co-delivery vehicle of SN38/CPT-11 and a BCRP inhibitor, BI@PEG-SN38 provides a new strategy for clinical development of SN38 and numerous ""chemosensitizers"", and exhibits promising applicability in precision cancer medicine.

"Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug to treat a range of cancers. However, its unfavorable effects, particularly the cardiotoxicity and the induction of multidrug resistance (MDR), significantly limit its clinical applications. Herein, a novel doxorubicin prodrug, PEG2K -DOX, is synthesized by conjugating a deprotonated doxorubicin molecule with the polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW: 2K) chain via pH-responsive hydrazone bond, and its potential as a better alternative than doxorubicin is evaluated. The data show that the amphiphilic PEG2K -DOX can self-assemble into stable nanoparticles with a high and fixed doxorubicin loading content (≈20 wt%), a favorable size of 91.5 nm with a narrow polydispersity (PDI = 0.14), good stability, and pH-dependent release behavior due to the acid-cleavable linkage between PEG and doxorubicin. Although doxorubicin hardly accumulates in MDR cells, PEG2K -DOX nanoparticles significantly increase the cellular uptake and cell-killing activity of doxorubicin in two MDR cancer cell lines MCF-7/ADR and KBv200, with the IC50 values dropped to 1.130% and 42.467% of doxorubicin, respectively. More impressively, PEG2K -DOX nanoparticles exhibit significantly improved plasma pharmacokinetics, increased in vivo therapeutic efficacy against MDR xenograft tumors, and better in vivo safety compared with doxorubicin. PEG2K -DOX nanoparticles hold the promise to become a better alternative than doxorubicin for cancer treatment, especially for MDR tumors."
"s with uniform hyperbranched structures are ideal carriers for drug and imaging probe delivery; however, the complicated synthesis and poor biocompatibility of these molecules hinder their biological applications. In this study, a facile method for the synthesis of a biocompatible polyglycerol dendrimer (PGD) was developed by reducing the synthesis steps and simplifying purification with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) as the core, and a zwitterionic surface of the dendrimer was achieved by modifying with L-cysteine. The synthesized zwitterionic PGD could avoid liver capture by the mononuclear phagocyte system because of its anti-fouling property. PGD was used to develop an extracellular dendritic MRI contrast agent (CA), which showed higher and longer MRI contrast enhancement in blood pools than the clinically used contrast agent (Magnevist) with minimal retention in organs, especially the liver. Hence, the zwitterionic PGD with excellent anti-fouling property and facile synthesis could be a promising carrier for drug and imaging probe delivery."

"Gene therapy aims to add, replace or turn off genes to help treat disease. To date, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 14 gene therapy products. With the increasing interest in gene therapy, feasible gene delivery vectors are necessary for inserting new genes into cells. There are different kinds of gene delivery vectors including viral vectors like lentivirus, adenovirus, retrovirus, adeno-associated virus et al, and non-viral vectors like naked DNA, lipid vectors, polymer nanoparticles, exosomes et al, with viruses being the most commonly used. Among them, the most concerned vector is adeno-associated virus (AAV) because of its safety, natural ability to efficiently deliver gene into cells and sustained transgene expression in multiple tissues. In addition, the AAV genome can be engineered to generate recombinant AAV (rAAV) containing transgene sequences of interest and has been proven to be a safe gene vector. Recently, rAAV vectors have been approved for the treatment of various rare diseases. Despite these approvals, some major limitations of rAAV remain, namely nonspecific tissue targeting and host immune response. Additional problems include neutralizing antibodies that block transgene delivery, a finite transgene packaging capacity, high viral titer used for per dose and high cost. To deal with these challenges, several techniques have been developed. Based on differences in engineering methods, this review proposes three strategies: gene engineering-based capsid modification (capsid modification), capsid surface tethering through chemical conjugation (surface tethering), and other formulations loaded with AAV (virus load). In addition, the major advantages and limitations encountered in rAAV engineering strategies are summarized."
"The ovulatory process is extraordinary in that it constitutes a hormone-induced injury. Gonadotropin delivered via the follicular vascular wreath stimulates secretion of plasminogen activator by contiguous ovarian surface epithelial cells. A consequent elevation in interstitial plasmin activates collagenases and cleaves tumor necrosis factor alpha from its anchors on endothelium. Collagen fibril degradation and cellular death at the apex of the preovulatory follicle are hallmarks of impending ovulation. Follicular contractions rupture the weakened fabric at the apex, and the ovum, which has been disconnected from the underlying granulosa, is expelled; these components of the cascade are prostaglandin-mediated. Ovulation is required for fertility; unfortunately, it imparts a cancer risk to the ovarian surface epithelium. DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species are generated by inflammatory cells attracted into the vicinity of the ovulatory stigma. An ischemia-reperfusion flux coincident with ovulation and wound repair also contributes to genotoxicity. Potentially mutagenic lesions in DNA are normally reconciled by TP53 tumor suppressor-dependent cell-cycle arrest and base excision repair mechanisms; it is a unifocal escape that could be problematic. Epithelial ovarian cancer is a deadly insidious disease because it typically remains asymptomatic until it has metastasized to vital abdominal organs."

"The adsorption-mediated transcytosis (AMT) induced by the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged surface of carriers and negatively charged cell membrane is a new paradigm enabling nanomedicine's tumor extravasation and infiltration. However, little is known about the correlation between the carrier's charge density and its AMT-induced tumor infiltration efficiency. Herein, we investigate the effect of the cationic polymer's charge on the AMT-induced tumor penetration ability using in vitro multilayer tumor spheroids (MTSs). A cationic polymer, polyethylenimine (PEI), is amidized with acetic anhydride to obtain acetylated PEIs (AcPEIs) with different cationic charge densities. As the amidization ratio increases, the AcPEIs' cytotoxicity, zeta potential, and cell-binding affinity significantly decrease. Notably, not only does the weak cell binding (AcPEIs with high acetylation degrees) lead to slow endocytosis and inefficient transcytosis, so does the strong cell-binding PEI. The PEI with 24% acetylation (AcPEI24%) is found to have the highest transcytosis efficiency because its balanced cell-binding affinity triggers fast adsorption-mediated endocytosis. The subsequent Golgi apparatus/endoplasmic reticulum-mediated exocytosis via extracellular vesicles leads to highly effective transcellular delivery and tumor penetration in MTSs. Therefore, the drug carrier's surface cationic charge density critically influences its AMT-induced tumor penetration efficiency. This study provides mechanistic insights into the design of drug-delivery systems with active transcytosis for improved tumor penetration and enhanced therapeutic efficiency."

"Multifunctional nano-materials that can be used to monitor the expression of specific biomarkers and serve as vehicles for controlled drug delivery are highly desirable. Herein, we report a new DNA-hybrid-gated core-shell upconversion nanoprobe (UCNP@MOF/DOX) for fluorescence analysis of microRNA-21 (miR-21), which also triggers the release of drug loaded in the probes for on-demand anti-cancer treatment. The nanoprobe is built on the merits of ultraviolet-visible light of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) excited by near-infrared (NIR) and extraordinary loading capability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for drug delivery. Controlled release of doxorubicin (DOX) from the nanoprobe by miR-21 underwent the following two-stage kinetics: a fast release stage specifically triggered by miR-21 and proportional to miR-21 concentration and a slow stage observed in both gated and ungated nanoprobes due to collapse of the UIO-66-NH2 coatings via ligand exchange with phosphates. In addition, the nanoprobe showed good selectivity, a linear response towards miR-21 ranging from 4 nM to 500 nM, and a limit of detection in 4 nM, which precluded unintended payload leakage due to low-abundance endogenous miR-21 expression in normal cells. Moreover, based on a dual-targeted delivery system constituted by AS1411-mediated recognition and responsive release of DOX, a specific cytotoxic efficacy was observed in MCF-7 cells. The present work provides a smart and robust nanoprobe for real-time detection of miRNA and dual-responsive drug delivery in tumor cells."

"th β-carboxylic acid groups are stable and negatively charged at physiological pH, but hydrolyze back to the corresponding amines and anhydrides once in an acidic environment. We thereby developed charge-reversal nanocarriers for drug delivery. In these systems, the anhydrides served only as groups to amidize the amines in cationic polymers and had no therapeutic use after being cleaved from the carrier in the cells. Herein, we utilized the characteristic anhydride structure of norcantharidin (NCTD) and the pH-dependent hydrolysis of its β-carboxylic amides and developed novel acid-labile conjugates for the targeted delivery of NCTD. In this study, NCTD was used as both an anticancer drug and an acid-labile anhydride to react with cationic polymers including PEI and PLL to form β-carboxylic amides. The obtained conjugates (PEI–NCTD and PLL–NCTD) had not only significantly improved NCTD solubility and high drug loading contents (as high as 72.3% and 56.8%, respectively, for PEI–NCTD and PLL–NCTD), but also favorable acid-labile capabilities. These conjugates were stable and negatively charged at neutral pH, but once in acidic environments (e.g. endo/lysosomes), they hydrolyzed and regenerated not only NCTD as an antitumor drug, but also the PEI or PLL, which could assist the endo/lysosomal escape and release of the drugs. Further, functionalizing the acid-labile conjugates with targeting moiety folic acid (FA) increased the cellular uptake of the conjugates into folate receptor-overexpressing tumor cells and thereby the in vitro cytotoxicity. These targeted acid-labile conjugates may help to reduce the side effects of NCTD and improve its clinical applications."
"Dendrimers are a family of polymers with highly branched structure, well-defined composition, and extensive functional groups, which have attracted great attention in biomedical applications. Micelles formed by dendrimers are ideal nanocarriers for delivering anticancer agents due to the explicit study of their characteristics of particle size, charge, and biological properties such as toxicity, blood circulation time, biodistribution, and cellular internalization. Here, the classification, preparation, and structure of dendrimer micelles are reviewed, and the specific functional groups modified on the surface of dendrimers for tumor active targeting, stimuli-responsive drug release, reduced toxicity, and prolonged blood circulation time are discussed. In addition, their applications are summarized as various platforms for biomedical applications related to cancer therapy including drug delivery, gene transfection, nano-contrast for imaging, and combined therapy. Other applications such as tissue engineering and biosensor are also involved. Finally, the possible challenges and perspectives of dendrimer micelles for their further applications are discussed."

" polymers have shown great potential as drug carriers due to their precise chemical makeup, nanosized structures and high density of surface functionalities, but most dendrimers bear functionalities only on the periphery, limiting their utility as drug-delivery carriers. Herein, we report synthesis of biodegradable bifunctional dendritic polymers with acrylate termini and interior hydroxyl groups. These bifunctional dendritic polymers are nontoxic and biodegradable, offering a versatile platform for various biomedical applications. As a proof of concept, the fourth-generation dendritic polymer was PEGylated on the periphery, and the anticancer drug camptothecin was tethered in its interior, forming a well-defined core–shell-structured dendritic polymer conjugate with a high drug loading capacity (up to ∼17.4 wt%)."
"Near infrared (NIR) fluorescent organic molecules as fluorescent probes accurately guide photothermal therapy as a potential antitumor method. However, the aggregation and quenching of organic fluorescent molecules and poor tissue permeability greatly limit their therapeutic effect and clinical transformation. In this paper, with a D-A-D structure as the molecular skeleton, cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) as the donor (D), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the acceptor (A), and long-chain isooctane as the shielding unit, organic fluorescent small molecules with a strong absorption band and bright NIR-II emission were synthesized. Then, tetraphenylethylene (TPE) molecules with typical AIE structure characteristics were introduced on both sides of the organic fluorescent small molecules, and an organic small molecular fluorophore (TDA) with AIE characteristics and the photothermal effect was designed. Through a series of experimental characterization techniques, it is proved that TDA NPs have good biocompatibility and tissue permeability, and can accurately locate the tumor location through NIR-II fluorescence imaging to achieve local photothermal treatment of tumors."

"Photodynamic therapy is the most important treatment strategy in free radical therapy. However, tumor microenvironment hypoxia is a key obstacle in PDT. In order to overcome this obstacle, the strategy of in situ production of O2/radicals by catalytic reaction in solid tumors was proposed. In recent years, it has been found that there are many oxygen-independent carbon-based free radicals that can generate toxic active free radicals under laser irradiation and lead to tumor cell death. Based on the rational design of multifunctional nano-medicine, the active free radical nano-generator has opened up a new way for the highly developed nanotechnology and tumor cooperative therapy to improve the therapeutic effect. In this paper, the research status of active free radical nano-generators, especially reactive oxygen species, including the construction mechanism of active free radical nanomaterials, is reviewed and the application of free radical nano-generators in tumor therapy is emphasized."
"Conventionally, polycations are pharmacological inert used as nonviral gene delivery vectors with the sole function of compacting and protecting nucleic acids. Here, the first autophagy-inhibiting cationic polymer delivering plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) is prepared for cancer gene therapy. The copolymerization of methacryloyl chloroquine (MACQ) with 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) not only improves transfection efficacy through hydrophobic modification, but also endows the copolymer with autophagy-blocking capability, which further sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL induced apoptosis. Importantly, the designed copolymer shows efficient TRAIL expression, autophagy inhibition and enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in an autophagy-dependent manner. In contrast, TRAIL gene delivered by the autophagy-blocking-deficient control copolymer without the chlorine atom presents weaker antitumor efficacy, although expressing a similar amount of therapeutic TRAIL protein. Thus, this study demonstrates a conceptually new approach in which the therapeutic outcome of the delivered gene can be inherently strengthened by the delivery vehicle with intrinsic pharmacological activity."
"Skin lesions and injuries can increase the risk of pathogen infections. Developing efficacious wound dressings could effectively prevent bacterial infection and accelerate wound healing. Herein, we developed chitosan composite hydrogels cross-linked by multifunctional diazo resin (DR) as antibacterial dressings for improved wound healing. The composite hydrogels were in situ formed by electrostatic interactions, chelation interactions, and covalent bonds between carboxylated chitosan and DR under ultraviolet assisted without small photosensitizer. The resultant hydrogels (noted as DR-CCH) showed good stability at different DR concentrations in physiological buffers. The antibacterial assays showed the DR-CCH could inhibit and kill Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. What is more, our hydrogels could accelerate wound healing in vivo. The present study demonstrates this composite DR-CCH with trace zinc has potential for accelerated wound healing."

"Taking advantage of their enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, nanomedicines have been extensively studied for targeted drug delivery to tumour tissues. However, tumour heterogeneity restricts the EPR effect and drug penetration into tumours, and nanoformulations only generate a limited therapeutic improvement in clinical settings. Macrophages have the inherent ability of tumour homing, stealth in blood circulation, and phagocytosis of particles. In this study, we used peritoneal macrophages as carriers for the delivery of SN38 nanoparticles (SN38-NPs) for cancer treatment. SN38-NPs were internalised by macrophages without any obvious effect on viability and migration, and not only induced apoptosis of tumour cells in vitro, but also accumulated in tumour tissues in vivo. In addition, the macrophage-based delivery system for SN38-NPs showed improved therapeutic effect than an equivalent dose of CPT-11 in an A549 subcutaneous tumour model."
"Ionizable cationic lipids are recognized as an essential component of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery but can be confounded by low lipoplex stability with mRNA during storage and in vivo delivery. Herein, the rational design and combinatorial synthesis of esterase-triggered decationizable quaternium lipid-like molecules (lipidoids) are reported to develop new LNPs with high delivery efficiency and improved storage stability. This top lipidoid carries positive charges at the physiological condition but promptly acquires negative charges in the presence of esterase, thus permitting stable mRNA encapsulation during storage and in vivo delivery while balancing efficient mRNA release in the cytosol. An optimal LNP formulation is then identified through orthogonal optimization, which enables efficacious mRNA transfection selectively in the spleen following intravenous administration. LNP-mediated delivery of ovalbumin (OVA)-encoding mRNA induces efficient antigen expression in antigen-presenting cells and elicits robust antigen-specific immune responses against OVA-transduced tumors. The work demonstrates the potential of decationizable quaternium lipidoids for spleen-selective RNA transfection and cancer immunotherapy."

"yme-responsive charge-reversal carriers can induce efficient transcytosis and lead to efficient tumor infiltration and potent anticancer efficacy. However, the correlations of molecular structure with charge-reversal property, tumor penetration, and drug delivery efficiency are unknown. Herein, aminopeptidase N (APN)-responsive conjugates were synthesized to investigate these correlations. We found that the monomeric unit structure and the polymer chain structure determined the enzymatic hydrolysis and charge-reversal rates, and accordingly, the transcytosis and tumor accumulation and penetration of the APN-responsive conjugates. The conjugate with moderate APN responsiveness balanced the in vitro transcytosis and in vivo overall drug delivery process and achieved the best tumor delivery efficiency, giving potent antitumor efficacy. This work provides new insight into the design of tumor enzyme-responsive charge-reversal nanomedicines for efficient cancer drug delivery."
"With the rapid development of molecular imaging, ultrasound (US) medicine has evolved from traditional imaging diagnosis to integrated diagnosis and treatment at the molecular level. Ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) play a crucial role in the integration of US diagnosis and treatment. As the micro-bubbles (MBs) in UCAs can enhance the cavitation effect and promote the biological effect of US, UCAs have also been studied in the fields of US thrombolysis, mediated gene transfer, drug delivery, and high intensity focused US. The application range of UCAs is expanding, and the value of their applications is improving. This paper reviews the development and application of UCAs in biomedicine in recent years, and the existing problems and prospects are pointed out."
"A bottlebrush polymer-cytotoxin prodrug, where a potent anticancer drug 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) and water-soluble methoxypolyethylene glycols (mPEG) were attached into the polyester backbone, was synthesized via thiol-ene reaction. The synthesized bottlebrush polymer-HCPT conjugate with drug loading content as high as ca. 20.4 wt% was characterized by NMR, IR, UV and fluorescence techniques. The prepared bottlebrush polymer-HCPT prodrug could self-assemble into nanosized micelles (ca. 153 nm), which were uniform and stable in aqueous solution. Moreover, when exposed to esterase, the formed prodrug micelles as stimuli-responsive nanomaterials could release HCPT. In the cellar uptake and cytotoxicity experiments, the formed prodrug micelles exhibited effective internalization into tumor cells and excellent anticancer efficacies."
"Monodisperse cross-linked porous poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) microspheres (~2.5 &mu;m in diameter) were prepared by using an improved two-step seed swelling polymerization method with monodisperse micron-grade PMMA microspheres seeds. The porous PMMA microspheres with diverse surface morphology and pore structure were obtained by tuning porogen systems. The monodisperse porous PMMA microspheres, which were prepared using toluene:dibutylphthalate (DBP) = 1:1 (v/v) as a porogen system, had the smallest pore size and the largest specific surface area. Then, the monodisperse porous PMMA microspheres were subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography. The liquid chromatographic column filler successfully realized complete separation of arginine, glycine and glutamic acid, and the separation effect was good. The porous PMMA microspheres provide a new material for the separation of amino acids by liquid chromatography."
"s is the main reason for cancer-associated mortality, and accurate diagnostic imaging of metastases is critical for the clinical administration and tailoring personalized treatments for metastatic tumors. However, magnetic resonance imaging of metastases in the liver is impeded by its low sensitivity because the currently used contrast agents accumulate in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells instead of cancer cells. Herein, a 4th generation zwitterionized biodegradable dendritic contrast agent (DCA) with a size of ca. 9 nm and a longitudinal relaxivity of 15.7 mM-1 s-1 in terms of Gd was synthesized and used to enhance the MRI of liver metastasis. The DCA could remarkably enhance the MRI of metastasized tumors in the liver, because it could simultaneously reduce the background signal in the liver by avoiding uptake by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells through the zwitterionization and increase the signal in tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Moreover, in contrast to non-biodegradable DCA, this DCA showed minimal long-term Gd3+ retention in all organs and tissues because it could be degraded into small fragments. The significant capability of enhancing the MRI of metastases in the liver plus its excellent biodegradability made this DCA a promising CA for metastatic tumor imaging."

"Green roofs are used increasingly to alleviate peaks of water discharge into the sewage systems in urban areas. Surface runoff from roofs contain pollutants from dry and wet deposition, and green roofs offer a possibility to reduce the amounts of pollutants in the water discharged from roofs by degradation and filtering. These pollutants would otherwise enter wastewater treatments plants and ultimately end up in sewage sludge that is spread on agricultural soils. The most common substrates used in green roofs have limited capacity for filtration and sorption. Also, more sustainable alternatives are sought, due to the high carbon footprint of these materials. Biochar is a carbon-rich material produced by pyrolysis of biomass, and several types of biochar have been described as good sorbents and filter materials. Biochar is also a light and carbon negative material, which may fulfill other desired criteria for new green roof substrates. We here report on an experiment where two types of biochar, produced from olive husks at 450 °C or from forest waste at 850 ° C were mixed with volcanic rock or peat, and tested for retention capacity of phenanthrene and six heavy metals in a column experiment with unsaturated gravimetric water flow lasting for 3 weeks. The results suggest that biochar as a component in green roof substrates perform better than traditional materials, concerning retention of the tested pollutants, and that different types of biochar have different properties in this respect."
"ew presents the state of the art of pH-responsive polymeric micelles for cancer drug delivery. Solid tumors have a weakly acidic extracellular pH (pH < 7), and cancer cells have even more acidic pH in endosomes and lysosomes (pH 4-6). The pH-gradients in tumor can be explored for tumor targeting and drug release in cancer drug delivery by applying pH-responsive polymeric micelles. The pH-responsive polymeric micelles consist of a corona and a core, and are made of amphiphilic copolymers, in which there are pH-responsive polymeric blocks. Two types of pH-responsive polymers-protonizable polymers and acid-labile polymers have been mainly used to make pH-responsive micelles for drug delivery. The protonizable polymers are polybases or polyacids, and their water-soluble/insoluble or charge states undergo changes with the protonation or deprotonation stimulated by external acidity, while the acid-labile polymers change their physical properties by chemical reaction stimulated by the acidity. Polymeric micelles whose core or coronas respond to the tumor extracellular acidity can be explored for triggering the fast release of the carried drug, activating the targeting group and accelerating the endocytosis of drug-loaded polymeric micelles, and those whose core or coronas respond to the tumor lysosomal acidity can be used for facilitating their escape from the lysosomes and targeting the nucleus. Various in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that pH-responsive polymeric micelles are effective for cellular targeting, internalization, fast drug release and nuclear localization, and hence enhancing the therapeutic efficacy and reducing the side effect of cancer chemical therapy."
"Cytokines affect nearly every biological process; these include embryonic development, disease pathogenesis, non-specific response to infection, specific response to antigen, changes in cognitive functions and progression of the degenerative processes of aging. In addition, cytokines are part of stem cell differentiation, vaccine efficacy and allograft rejection. This short insight focuses on the milestones in cytokine biology and how the various and often contradictory activities of these small, non-structural proteins affected the fields of inflammation and immunology. Multiple biological properties or pleiotropism is the hallmark of a cytokine. Today, the term ""cytokine"" encompasses interferons, the interleukins, the chemokine family, mesenchymal growth factors, the tumor necrosis factor family and adipokines. As of this writing, 33 cytokines are called interleukins, but many are part of families of related but distinct gene products. There are certainly over 100 separate genes coding for cytokine-like activities, many with overlapping functions and many still unexplored. Also discussed in this overview are the failures and successes of cytokines as therapeutic targets. A recent advance in the field has been that of differential cytokine production, which can be used to classify human disease as being ""autoimmune"" or ""autoinflammatory"" thus impacting on therapeutic interventions."
"Cytokeratin 19-positive (CK19+) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive subtype characterized by early recurrence and chemotherapy tolerance. However, there is no specific therapeutic option for CK19+ HCC. The correlation between tumor recurrence and expression status of CK19 were studied in 206 patients undergoing liver transplantation for HCC. CK19-/+ HCC cells were isolated to screen effective antitumor drugs. The therapeutic effects of regorafenib were evaluated in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from 10 HCC patients. The mechanism of regorafenib on CK19+ HCC was investigated. CK19 positiveness indicated aggressiveness of tumor and higher recurrence risk of HCC after liver transplantation. The isolated CK19+ HCC cells had more aggressive behaviors than CK19- cells. Regorafenib preferentially increased the growth inhibition and apoptosis of CK19+ cells in vitro, whereas sorafenib, apatinib, and 5-fluorouracil did not. In PDX models from CK19-/+ HCC patients, the tumor control rate of regorafenib achieved 80% for CK19+ HCCs, whereas 0% for CK19- HCCs. RNA-sequencing revealed that CK19+ cells had elevated expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, which are essential for mitochondrial function. Further experiments confirmed that regorafenib attenuated the mitochondrial respiratory capacity in CK19+ cells. However, the mitochondrial respiration in CK19- cells were faint and hardly repressed by regorafenib. The mitochondrial respiration was regulated by the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which was inhibited by regorafenib in CK19+ cells. Hence, CK19 could be a potential marker of the therapeutic benefit of regorafenib, which facilitates the individualized therapy for HCC. STAT3/mitochondria axis determines the distinct response of CK19+ cells to regorafenib treatment."
"Accumulating evidence suggests that stromal modifications improve chemotherapeutic outcomes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, combination regimens of stroma-modifying agents and small-molecule cytotoxic drugs have achieved only limited improvements in the clinic, probably due to unsatisfactory pharmacokinetic profiles and restricted drug distribution in tumors. Here, we developed self-assembled prodrug nanoparticles integrating a stromal reprogramming inducer, calcipotriol (CAL), and a potent chemotherapeutic agent, 7-Ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38), to treat PDAC. While SN38 is conjugated to the block polymer backbone, CAL is loaded into the inner hydrophobic space during polymer self-assembly into nanoparticles. To achieve an efficient drug co-package, a planar and hydrophobic cholesterol domain was introduced to stabilize the hydrophobic CAL. Notably, the blood circulation time of CAL significantly improved as CAL|SN38 nanoparticle (CAL|SN38 NP). In addition, CAL|SN38 NP treatment significantly decreased the expression of N-cadherin, collagen, and fibronectin in tumors, which play critical roles in PDAC metastasis. Potent inhibition of primary tumor growth and vigorous anti-metastasis effects were observed after systemic administration of CAL|SN38 NP to stroma-rich PDAC orthotopic tumor-bearing mice. These findings provide a promising paradigm for developing tailor-made nanoparticles with potent stroma-modification capability to combat metastatic cancer."

"Hesperetin, an abundant bioactive component of citrus fruits, is poorly water-soluble, resulting in low oral bioavailability. We developed new formulations to improve the water solubility, antioxidant activity, and oral absorption of hesperetin. Two nano-based formulations were developed, namely hesperetin-TPGS (D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) micelles and hesperetin-phosphatidylcholine (PC) complexes. These two formulations were prepared by a simple technique called solvent dispersion, using US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved excipients for drugs. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) were used to characterize the formulations' physical properties. Cytotoxicity analysis, cellular antioxidant activity assay, and a pharmacokinetic study were performed to evaluate the biological properties of these two formulations. The final weight ratios of both hesperetin to TPGS and hesperetin to PC were 1:12 based on their water solubility, which increased to 21.5- and 20.7-fold, respectively. The hesperetin-TPGS micelles had a small particle size of 26.19 nm, whereas the hesperetin-PC complexes exhibited a larger particle size of 219.15 nm. In addition, the cellular antioxidant activity assay indicated that both hesperetin-TPGS micelles and hesperetin-PC complexes increased the antioxidant activity of hesperetin to 4.2- and 3.9-fold, respectively. Importantly, the in vivo oral absorption study on rats indicated that the micelles and complexes significantly increased the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) from 2.64 μg/mL to 20.67 and 33.09 μg/mL and also increased the area under the concentration-time curve of hesperetin after oral administration to 16.2- and 18.0-fold, respectively. The micelles and complexes increased the solubility and remarkably improved the in vitro antioxidant activity and in vivo oral absorption of hesperetin, indicating these formulations' potential applications in drugs and healthcare products."
"of thioether profragrances was prepared by reaction of different sulfanylalkanoates with δ‐damascone and tested for their release efficiencies in a fabric‐softener and an all‐purpose cleaner application. Dynamic headspace analysis on dry cotton and on a ceramic plate revealed that the performance of the different precursors depended on the structure, but also on the particular conditions encountered in different applications. Moreover, profragrances derived from other α,β‐unsaturated fragrance aldehydes and ketones were synthesized analogously and evaluated using the same test protocol. Thioethers were found to be suitable precursors to release the corresponding fragrances, but neither the quantity of profragrance deposited from an aqueous environment onto the target surface, nor the amount of fragrance released after deposition could be linearly correlated to the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the compounds. Different sets of compounds were found to be the best performers for different types of applications. Only one of the compounds evaluated in the present work, namely the thiolactic acid derivative of δ‐damascone, efficiently released the corresponding fragrance in both of the tested applications. Profragrance development for functional perfumery thus remains a partially empirical endeavour. More knowledge (and control) of the various application conditions are required for an efficient profragrance design."
"of hydrophilic−hydrophobic block polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol)−block-poly(ϵ-caprolactone) (PEG−b-PCL), used as drug-delivery carriers, are generally fabricated via solvent displacement or dialysis, which is time-consuming, requires freeze drying, and can leave toxic traces of the residual organic solvents. An alternative is presented in this paper: form micellar PEG−b-PCL nanoparticles in a supercritical fluid solvent and then disperse them in water toward a water-dispensable formulation. This method is illustrated with pressure−temperature phase diagrams for PEG−b-PCL in supercritical trifluoromethane, which is selective enough for the PCL and PEG blocks to induce micellization. When subjected to decompression to remove trifluoromethane, dry and organic solvent-free nanoparticles are readily obtained. Their micellar structure is immediately reestablished in water, as confirmed by laser light scattering. Neither has been demonstrated previously."
"ne-block-polyisoprene forms micelles in supercritical and subcritical propane upon cooling and decompression. These micelles decompose upon heating and compression. At constant polymer concentration, the micellization points, both isobaric and isothermal, fall around a decreasing boundary curve in pressure−temperature coordinates. This micellization boundary curve lies above the copolymer cloud-point curve and below the free-polystyrene cloud-point curve. At the onset of micellization, a trace of free polystyrene can cause a characteristic scattering peak as it precipitates upon cooling or decompression or both."
"sfer radical polymerizations (ATRPs) of 1-(4-methacryloyloxy-benzyl)thymine (MAT) and 9-(2-methacryloyloxyethyl)adenine (MAA) were conducted for the synthesis of DNA-base functionalized polymers.

A zipper-like diblock copolymer, PMAT-b-PMAA, was prepared by anchoring the PMAT and PMAA blocks on the ortho-positions of a pyridine ring via a successive two-step ATRP.

"e transport of nanoparticles into the solid tumor through cell transcytosis has shown great promise in cancer nanomedicine, but it is challenging to develop efficient active transporting nanomedicines with the potential for clinical translation. Here, a type of tertiary amine oxide (TAO)‐containing zwitterionic liposomal nanocarriers is developed that can hitchhike red blood cells (RBCs) to tumor blood vessels and enter solid tumors through transcytosis. To boost the active‐transporting capability, a library of the TAO liposomes (TAOLs) with different chemical structures and particle sizes is constructed and screened by their stability and active transporting capability. Two types of TAOLs are identified that can induce efficient tumor cell transcytosis through rapid macropinocytosis and endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi‐involved exocytosis. It is found that these zwitterionic TAOLs can hitchhike RBCs to gain long blood circulation, get off the cell at the tumor site, effectively enter the tumor through transcytosis, and infiltrate the whole tumor. The chemotherapeutic drug‐loaded liposomes can stop the tumor progression of mice bearing human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, exhibiting superior antitumor activity compared to the traditional liposomal drug. This study demonstrates a strategy to construct effective active transporting liposomal nanomedicines for efficient tumor entrance."
"In the past few decades, various vanadium compounds have displayed potential in cancer treatment. However, fast clearness in the body and possible toxicity of vanadium compounds has hindered their further development. Vanadium-based nanomaterials not only overcome these limitations, but take advantage of the internal properties of vanadium in photics and magnetics, which enable them as a multimodal platform for cancer diagnosis and treatment. In this paper, we first introduced the basic biological and pharmacological functions of vanadium compounds in treating cancer. Then, the synthesis routes of three vanadium-based nanomaterials were discussed, including vanadium oxides, 2D vanadium sulfides, carbides and nitrides: VmXn (X = S, C, N) and water-insoluble vanadium salts. Finally, we highlighted the applications of these vanadium-based nanomaterials as tumor therapeutic and diagnostic agents."
"Non-viral gene delivery is an attractive approach for the treatment of many diseases including cancer, benefiting from its safety and large-scale production concerns. However, the relatively low transfection efficacy compared with viral vectors restricts the clinical applications of non-viral gene vectors. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered charge reversal polymers (named B-PDEAEA) presented improved transfection efficacy, because of fast release of plasmid DNA responding to enhanced oxidative stress in cancer cells. But inadequate dissociation can still occur owing to the insufficient intracellular ROS generation. Here, we report SAHA (vorinostat), which is a clinical histone deacetylase inhibitor and anticancer drug, induces the ROS accumulation in cancer cells, and facilitates the charge reversal process of B-PDEAEA and the cellular dissociation of the delivered gene from the vectors. As a result, SAHA remarkably increases the gene transfection efficacy in an ROS-dependent manner. Importantly, SAHA synergizes with B-PDEAEA mediated therapeutic gene TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) delivery in inducing apoptosis of cancer cells. These findings support the first concept of improving the gene delivery efficacy of stimuli-responsive vectors through upregulating the cellular ROS via an FDA approved anticancer agent. Additionally, combination of SAHA and TRAIL gene therapy could be a potential strategy for cancer treatment."
" labyrinth test and determining lipid peroxide (LPO) contents were used to assay the effects of Codonopsis lanceolata on promoting intelligence development and lipid peroxide. The results showed that latent period of old mice in water labyrinth was statistically shorten and the number of mistake of old mice was visibly reduced by drinking extraction of Codonopsis lanceolate 4 g/kg and 8 g/kg. These indicated that mice drinking extraction of Codonopsis lanceloata learned faster that those of drinking water. The contents of LPO in red blood cell and brain of mice and rate drinking extraction of Codonopsis lanceolata were significantly reduced, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in serum of rat drinking extraction of Codonopsis lanceolata were visibly increased. These presents that the extraction of Codonopsis lanceolata has the role of promoting learning and memory of old animal, its mechanism might be increasing SOD activity and decreasing LPO level."

"Fluorescent imaging with fluorophores has become a powerful way to explore complex biological systems and visualize nanoparticles for drug delivery. However, it is challenging to develop fluorophores with ideal physical and optical properties. We report a method to synthesize cyanine nanodots with a single-molecule structure, well-defined particle size, customizable fluorescent spectrum, and bright and stable fluorescence. These cyanine nanodots are acquired by the divergent synthesis of cyanine-dye-cored polylysine (PLL) dendrimers. We demonstrated the feasibility of the method by synthesizing cyanine 3 (Cy3), cyanine 5 (Cy5), or cyanine 7 (Cy7) cored single-molecule nanodots up to eight generations with a size of around 11 nm. We show that these cyanine nanodots are capable of multiple biomedical applications, including multicolor cellular tracing and cancer imaging. These cyanine nanodots possess many merits of organic dots and quantum dots that are promising for future application."

"Using mangosteen shell as raw material and KOH as the activator, the effects of different conditions on the yield of activated carbon, methylene blue, and iodine adsorption value were studied. Four factors were selected as an impregnation ratio, concentration of activator, activation temperature and activation time. The optimum technological parameters for preparing mangosteen shell activated carbon was determined by orthogonal experiment. The results were analyzed by pore size analysis and spectral analysis. Potassium hydroxide as an activator can easily produce macroporous activated carbon, which is a good adsorbent for garment printing and dyeing wastewater."
"Successful transfection of plasmid DNA (pDNA) requires intranuclear internalization of pDNA effectively and the nuclear envelope appears to be one of the critical intracellular barriers for polymer mediated pDNA delivery. Polyethylenimine (PEI), as the classic cationic polymer, compact the negatively charged pDNA tightly and make up stable polyplexes. The polyplexes are too large to enter the nuclear through nuclear pores and it is believed that the nuclear envelope breakdown in mitosis could facilitate the nuclear entry of polyplexes. To jump the nuclear envelope barrier, we used a selective and reversible CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 to control the G2/M transition of the cell cycle and increased the proportion of mitotic cells which have disappeared nuclear envelope during transfection. Herein, we show that RO-3306 remarkably increases the transfection efficiency of PEI polyplexes through enhanced nuclear localization of PEI and pDNA. However, RO-3306 is less effective to the charge-reversal polymer poly[(2-acryloyl)ethyl(p-boronic acid benzyl)diethylammonium bromide] (B-PDEAEA) which responses to cellular stimuli and releases free pDNA in cytoplasm. Our findings not only offer new opportunities for improving non-viral based gene delivery but also provide theoretical support for the rational design of novel functional polymers for gene delivery. We also report current data showing that RO-3306 synergizes TRAIL gene induced apoptosis in cancer cells."

" forms of ionic liquids have many potential applications because of their high thermal stability and ionic nature. Two ionic liquid monomers, 1-(4-vinylbenzyl)-3-butyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (VBIT) and 1-(4-vinylbenzyl)-3- butyl imidazolium hexafluorophosphate (VBIH), were synthesized through the quaternization of N-butylimidazole with 4-vinylbenzylchloride and a subsequent anion- exchange reaction with sodium tetrafluoroborate or potassium hexafluorophosphate. Copper-mediated atom transfer radical polymerization was used to polymerize VBIT and VBIH. The effects of various initiator/catalyst systems, monomer concentrations, solvent polarities, and reaction temperatures on the polymerization were examined. The polymerization was well controlled and exhibited living characteristics when CuBr/1,1,4,7,10,10-hexamethyltriethylenetetramine or CuBr/2,2′-bipyridine was used as the catalyst and ethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate was used as the initiator. Characterizations by thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction showed that the resulting VBIT polymer, poly[1-(4-vinylbenzyl)-3-butyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate] (PVBIT), was amorphous and had excellent thermal stability, with a glass-transition temperature of 84 °C. The polymerized ionic liquids could absorb CO2 as ionic liquids: PVBIT absorbed 0.30% (w/w) CO2 at room temperature and 0.78 atm. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator interferon gene (cGAS-STING) pathway is an emerging therapeutic target for the prophylaxis and therapy of a variety of diseases, ranging from cancer, infectious diseases, to autoimmune disorders. As a cytosolic double stranded DNA (dsDNA) sensor, cGAS can bind with relatively long dsDNA, resulting in conformational change and activation of cGAS. Activated cGAS catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) into cGAMP, a cyclic dinucleotide (CDN). CDNs, including 2'3'-cGAMP, stimulate adapter protein STING on the endoplasmic membrane, triggering interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation. This results in antitumor and antiviral type I interferon (IFN-I) responses. Moreover, cGAS-STING overactivation and the resulting IFN-I responses have been associated with a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. This makes cGAS-STING appealing immunomodulatory targets for the prophylaxis and therapy of various related diseases. However, drug development of CDNs and CDN derivatives is challenged by their limited biostability, difficult formulation, poor pharmacokinetics, and inefficient tissue accumulation and cytosolic delivery. Though recent synthetic small molecular CDN- or non-CDN-based STING agonists have been reported with promising preclinical therapeutic efficacy, their therapeutic efficacy and safety remain to be fully evaluated preclinically and clinically. Therefore, it is highly desirable and clinically significant to advance drug development for cGAS-STING activation by innovative approaches, such as drug delivery systems and drug development for pharmacological immunomodulation of cGAS. In this Account, we summarize our recent research in the engineering and delivery of immunostimulatory or immunoregulatory modulators for cGAS and STING for the immunotherapy of cancer and autoimmune diseases. To improve the delivery efficiency of CDNs, we developed ionizable and pH-responsive polymeric nanocarriers to load STING agonists, aiming to improve the cellular uptake and facilitate the endosomal escape to induce efficient STING activation. We also codelivered STING agonists with complementary immunostimulatants in nanoparticle-in-hydrogel composites to synergetically elicit potent innate and adaptive antitumor responses that eradicate local and distant large tumors. Further, taking advantage of the simplicity of manufacturing and the established nucleic acid delivery system, we developed oligonucleotide-based cGAS agonists as immunostimulant immunotherapeutics as well as adjuvants for peptide antigens for cancer immunotherapy. To suppress the overly strong proinflammatory responses associated with cGAS-STING overactivation in some of the autoimmune disorders, we devised nanomedicine-in-hydrogel (NiH) that codelivers a cGAS inhibitor and cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-scavenging cationic nanoparticles (cNPs) for systemic immunosuppression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapy. Lastly, we discussed current drug development by targeting cGAS-STING for cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases, as well as the potential opportunities for utilizing cGAS-STING pathway for versatile applications in disease treatment."
"In this paper, we have developed a novel method for the preparation of covalently connected capillary coatings in which diazotized poly (vinyl alcohol-b-styrene) (diazo-P(VA-b-St)) was used as a photosensitive coating agent. Firstly, the diazo-P(VA-b-St) coating was self-assembled on the inner surface of the capillary, and then irradiated by ultraviolet (UV) light to convert the ionic bonding into covalent bonding through the unique photochemical reaction of diazo groups. The covalently connected coatings inhibited the protein adsorption on the inner surface of the capillary, as a result, the baseline protein separation of ribonuclease A (RNase A), lysozyme (Lyz) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were attained by utilizing the capillary electrophoresis (CE). The covalently connected diazo-P(VA-b-St) capillary coatings have greater CE separation performance with magnificent repeatability and enhanced stability, when compared with non-covalently coated or bare capillaries. This strategy to synthesize photosensitive diazo-P(VA-b-St) capillary coatings for their use in capillary electrophoresis separation of proteins is highly environment-friendly as it does not involve the use of extremely noxious and moisture penetrating coatings of silane."

"Effective combination therapies are urgently needed to treat triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is insensitive to the existing treatment regimens. However, the synergistic potency of traditional small-molecule combinations is limited in TNBC mainly due to mismatched molar ratios, inconsistent pharmacokinetics, and intratumoral accumulation of individual drugs. Here, we find that the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the topoisomerase I inhibitor 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38) exhibit synergistic effects when the molar ratio reaches 5:1. We further develop a glutathione-responsive self-assembled combination nanoparticle (Combo NP) to integrate individual HCQ and SN38 polymeric prodrugs at the optimized ratio. In TNBC cells treated with Combo NP, HCQ-mediated autophagy blockage significantly enhances the DNA damage and apoptotic effect of SN38, manifesting synergistically cytotoxic effects of Combo NP. In vivo evaluations show that Combo NP maintains the molar ratio of HCQ to SN38 within the synergistic range in mouse blood circulation and intratumoral tissues. More importantly, Combo NP elicits superior therapeutic benefit in metastatic TNBC models, compared to free drug combination as well as single drug nanoparticles. Taken together, our engineered nanosystem highlights a nanoprodrug-based chemosensitizing approach for improving the therapeutic response to TNBC, addressing the major challenges of the current combination therapy."
"Vancomycin is an amphoteric glycopeptide molecule, and its group diversity and chiral active sites provide a potential basis for its application in chromatographic analysis. In this article, using photosensitive diazo resin (DR) as the coupling agent, vancomycin is modified on the inner wall of the capillary to construct a capillary coating separation system. The highlight of the coated capillary is that it has both anti-protein adsorption and chiral separation properties. Compared with the bare capillary or non-covalently bonded DR/vancomycin-coated capillary, it can not only achieve the separation of four mixed proteins of lysozyme (Lys), bovine serum albumin (BSA), myoglobin (Mb), and ribonuclease A (RNase A), but also shows excellent performance in chiral drugs. The coated capillary effectively solves the problems of low efficiency of the separation column and high sample loss and provides ideas for the development of coated capillaries in the future."

Many of these developments are starting to be translated into viable clinical products. Here, we provide an overview of recent developments in nanomedicine and highlight the current challenges and upcoming opportunities for the field and translation to the clinic."

"This Concept examines strategies to design advanced polymers with high CO2 permeability and high CO2 /N2 selectivity, which are the key to the success of membrane technology for CO2 capture from fossil fuel-fired power plants. Specifically, polymers with enhanced CO2 solubility and thus CO2 /N2 selectivity are designed by incorporating CO2 -philic groups in polymers such as poly(ethylene oxide)-containing polymers and poly(ionic liquids); polymers with enhanced CO2 diffusivity and thus CO2 permeability are designed with contorted rigid polymer chains to obtain high free volume, such as polymers with intrinsic microporosity and thermally rearranged polymers. The underlying rationales for materials design are discussed and polymers with promising CO2 /N2 separation properties for CO2 capture from flue gas are highlighted."
"ched polyelectrolytes with polyacrylamide backbones and poly[(2-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate methylsulfate] (polyDMAEMA-DMS) side chains were prepared by free-radical macromonomer polymerization. PolyDMAEMADMS macromonomers bearing terminal styrenic moieties were synthesized by living anionic polymerization with lithium 4-vinylbenzylamide (LiVBA) and lithium N-isopropyl-4-vinylbenzylamide (LiPVBA) as initiators. In the presence of LiCl, LiPVBA initiated a living polymerization of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and produced polymers with well-controlled molecular weights and low polydispersities. LiVBA could not directly initiate DMAEMA polymerization. After being capped with two units of dimethylacrylamide, DMAEMA polymerized with an initiator efficiency of 63%. The quaternization of the poly[(2-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylatel macromonomer with dimethyl sulfate yielded the cationic polyDMAEMA-DMS macromonomer. The polyDMAEMA-DMS macromonomer had a much higher reactivity than acrylamide in free-radical polymerization. This might have been due to the formation of polyDMAEMA-DMS micelles in the polymerization system. The high macromonomer reactivity caused composition drift in a batch process. A semibatch method with a constant polyDMAEMA-DMS feed rate was used to control the copolymer composition."
"Tumor-associated macrophages, especially M2-like macrophages, are extensively involved in tumor growth and metastasis, suppressing the innate immunity to help tumor cells escape and reshaping the microenvironment to help metastatic cells grow. However, in vivo, real-time visualized migration of M2-like macrophages has never been explored to monitor the tumor metastasis process. Herein, we prepared an M2-like macrophage-targeting nitric oxide (NO)-responsive nanoprobe (NRP@M-PHCQ) consisting of an amphiphilic block copolymer with mannose and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) moieties (denoted as M-PHCQ) and a NO-responsive NIR-II probe (denoted as NRP). The mannose moieties provided M2-like macrophage-targeting capacity, and the HCQ moieties polarized M2-like macrophages to M1-like ones with enhanced NO secretion. Consequently, NRP@M-PHCQ was lit up by the secreted NO to visualize the migration and polarization of M2-like macrophages in real time. In vivo metastasis imaging with NRP@M-PHCQ successfully tracked early tumor metastasis in the lymph nodes and the lungs with high sensitivity, even superior to Luci-labeled bioluminescence imaging, suggesting the extensive distribution and critical role of M2-like macrophages in tumor metastasis. In general, this work provided a new strategy to sensitively image metastatic tumors by tracking the polarization of M2-like macrophages and visually disclosed the critical role of M2-like macrophages in early tumor metastasis."
"shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites with Co3O4 as the core, Fe3O4/C as the shell, and a cavity structure were synthesized by the hard template method. The physical and chemical properties of the composites were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, TGA, XPS, BET, and VSM. The specific surface area of yolk-shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites is 175.9 m2 g-1, showing superparamagnetic properties. The yolk-shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites were used as heterogeneous Fenton catalysts to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade MB, which showed high catalytic degradation performance. The degradation rate of MB reached 100% within 30 min under the circumstances of the yolk-shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites dosage of 0.1 g L-1, the PMS dosage of 1.0 g L-1, the initial MB concentration of 100 mg L-1, an initial pH of 5.5, and a temperature of 30±2 ℃. The enhanced catalytic performance of the yolk-shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the two catalytically active materials and the middle cavity. The effects of different operating parameters and co-existing anion species on MB degradation were also investigated. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis and quenching experiments confirmed that the formation of SO₄̇⁻ in the yolk-shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C/PMS system contributes to MB degradation. In addition, yolk-shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites can be easily separated from the pollutant solution under the action of an external magnetic field, and the degradation rate of MB can still reach 98% after five cycles, indicating that it has good stability and reusability and has broad application prospects in the field of water purification."
"Polymeric nanocapsules hold considerable applications in cancer drug delivery, but the synthesis of well-defined nanocapsules with a tunable drug release property remains a significant challenge in fabrication. Herein, we demonstrate a supramolecular complexation strategy to assemble small molecular platinum (Pt) compounds into well-defined nanocapsules with high drug loading, acidity-sensitivity, and tunable Pt releasing profile. The design utilizes poly(ethylene glycol)-dendritic polylysine-G4/amides to complex with Pt compounds, forming stable nanocapsules with diameters approximately ∼20 nm and membrane thickness around several nanometers. The stability, drug content, and release profiles are tunable by tailoring the dendritic structure. The designated polymer-Pt nanocapsules, PEG-G4/MSA-Pt, showed sustained blood retention, preferential tumor accumulation, enhanced cellular uptake, lysosomal drug release, and nuclear delivery capability. PEG-G4/MSA-Pt showed enhanced antitumor efficacy compared to free cisplatin and other nanocapsules, which stopped the progression of both A549 cell xenografts and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of hepatocellular carcinoma on a mice tumor model. Thus, we believe this strategy is promising for developing Pt-based nanomedicine for cancer drug delivery."
"During the occurring of cutaneous trauma, increasing oxidative stress response in wound site retards the progress of proliferation phase, impeding sequent efficient wound repair. At the same time, high-quality healing also requires adequate new blood vessels in order to furnish the wound site with a nutrient and oxygen-sufficient environment. Here we synthesized a novel hyaluronic acid (HA) material modified with a peroxidation inhibitor 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (ATEMPO) for prevention of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promotion of angiogenesis after full-thickness skin excision in rats. Amines in ATEMPO attaching with carbonyls in HA chains was fabricated through N-acylation. The HA-g-TEMPO exerted a ROS-scavenging and angiogenesis-promoting function in vitro. In acute wound rat model, the wound closure efficacy was significantly improved to almost 55% at day 6 in comparison to 49% of HA, and wound sites in initial wound phase was also narrowed down sharply. Moreover, initially formed blood vessels were found in wound sites, further proved the angiogenesis-promoting function of HA-g-TEMPO. More interestingly, wound sites demonstrated an exciting regenerative healing effect which was characterized by marked skin appendages as well as reduced scarring. Therefore, this strategy showed a promising future that could be considered as a reliable and effective method to cutaneous wound healing."

"s more and more practically relevant but challenging to fabricate single-component omnipotent nanotheranostic agents integrated with multimode imaging and multiple therapeutic functions. In this study, 2D Bi2S3 nanosheets were successfully synthesized in a rapid and environmentally friendly manner and were applied into tumor therapy. The resulting nanosheets exhibit high photothermal conversion efficiency due to their strong broad absorbance in the near-infrared (NIR) window and serve as a nanotheranostic agent for photoacoustic imaging and photothermal cancer therapy. In addition, they also display excellent drug (DOX) delivery capacity for the large surface area and negative electron surface enrichment. Additionally, they have also showed sensitive pH responsiveness for drug releasing, accelerating releasing in acidic environment. Our work for the first time discovers the great potential of using Bi2S3-PEG nanosheets as a type of 2D nanocarriers in drug delivery and cancer combination therapy."
"Metal selenide nanomaterials have received enormous attention as they possess diverse compositions, microstructures, and properties. The combination of selenium with various metallic elements gives the metal selenide nanomaterials distinctive optoelectronic and magnetic properties, such as strong near-infrared absorption, excellent imaging properties, good stability, and long in vivo circulation. This makes metal selenide nanomaterials advantageous and promising for biomedical applications. This paper summarizes the research progress in the last five years in the controlled synthesis of metal selenide nanomaterials in different dimensions and with different compositions and structures. Then we discuss how surface modification and functionalization strategies are well-suited for biomedical fields, including tumor therapy, biosensing, and antibacterial biological applications. The future trends and issues of metal selenide nanomaterials in the biomedical field are also discussed."

A number of major trends can be distinguished in the multidisciplinary field of biomaterials science, including the precise synthesis of biomaterial building blocks, elucidation of biomaterial processing-structure-property correlations, as well as clarification of the interactions between living tissues and biomaterials. Moreover, advances in biofabrication facilitate the development of tailored implants with improved functionality, whereas recent achievements in medical imaging allow for a detailed evaluation of the performance and spatiotemporal behavior of medical devices and nanomedicine formulations."
"tive catalysts mediating atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) at low concentrations, therefore requiring no postpolymerization catalyst removal, are highly desirable for wide commercial applications of ATRP. We previously reported that CuBr ligated by a hexadentate ligand, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN), was highly active in ATRP, but in solution the activator existed as a binuclear [Cu2Br2(TPEN)] complex and had to rearrange to form a more active mononuclear pentadentate active center for catalysis. Herein, we prepared N,N,N′-tris(2-pyridylmethyl)-N′-methylethylenediamine (TPMEN), a pentadentate ligand equivalent to a TPEN with one pyridyl group removed, and used it as a ligand for copper halides to understand the effect of the catalyst structure on its catalysis in ATRP. TPMEN formed mononuclear complexes with both copper(I) and copper(II) halides. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) results showed that CuI/TPMEN−CuII/TPMEN couples had a more negative redox potential tha..."
"rties of a ligand, including molecular structure and substituents, strongly affect the catalyst activity and control of the polymerization in atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). A new tetradentate ligand, N,N'-bis(pyridin-2-yl-methyl-3-hexoxo-3-oxopropyl)ethane-1,2-diamine (BPED) was synthesized and examined as the ligand of copper halide for ATRP of styrene (St), methyl acrylate (MA), and methyl methacrylate (MMA), and compared with other analogous linear tetrdendate ligands. The BPED ligand was found to significantly promote the activation reaction: the CuBr/BPED complex reacted with the initiators so fast that a large amount of Cu(II)Br 2 /BPED was produced and thus the polymerizations were slow for all the monomers. The reaction of CuCl/BPED with the initiator was also fast, but by reducing the catalyst concentration or adding CuCl 2 , the activation reaction could be slowed to establish the equilibrium of ATRP for a well-controlled living polymerization of MA. CuCl/BPED was found very active for the polymerization of MA. For example, 10 mol% of the catalyst relatively to the initiator was sufficient to mediate a living polymerization of MA. The CuCl/BPED, however, could not catalyze a living polymerization of MMA because the resulting CuCl 2 /BPED could not deactivate the growing radicals. The effects of the ligand structures on the catalysis of ATRP are also discussed."
"Traumatic multidrug resistant bacterial infections are the most lethal threat to wound healing. Antimicrobial peptides have been widely used in the antimicrobial field for their good biocompatibility and resistance to multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this work, bacterial membranes of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were extracted and immobilized on homemade silica microspheres to make a bacterial membrane chromatography stationary phase in order to quickly screen for peptides with antibacterial effects. The antimicrobial peptide was then successfully screened using bacterial membrane chromatography from a library of peptides synthesized by the one-bead-one-compound method. The antimicrobial peptide was effective in better shielding both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Based on this antimicrobial peptide (RWPIL), we have developed an antimicrobial hydrogel with a backbone of this antimicrobial peptide and oxidized dextran (ODEX). Owing to the interlinkage between the aldehyde group in oxidized dextran and the amine group from the trauma tissue, the hydrogel extends over the irregular obverse of the skin defect and promotes epithelial cell adhesion. Based on the histomorphological analysis, we confirmed that the RWPIL-ODEX hydrogel exerts a powerful therapeutic effect in a wound infection model. In conclusion, we have developed a new antimicrobial peptide, RWPIL, and a hydrogel based on the peptide that kills multidrug-resistant bacteria parasitic on wounds and promotes wound healing."
"Transcytosis-based active transport of cancer nanomedicine has shown great promise for enhancing its tumor extravasation and infiltration and antitumor activity, but how the key nanoproperties of nanomedicine, particularly particle size, influence the transcytosis remains unknown. Herein, we used a transcytosis-inducing polymer, poly[2-(N-oxide-N,N-diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (OPDEA), and fabricated stable OPDEA-based micelles with different sizes (30, 70, and 140 nm in diameter) from its amphiphilic block copolymer, OPDEA-block-polystyrene (OPDEA-PS). The study of the micelle size effects on cell transcytosis, tumor extravasation, and infiltration showed that the smallest micelles (30 nm) had the fastest transcytosis and, thus, the most efficient tumor extravasation and infiltration. So, the 7-ethyl-10-hydroxyl camptothecin (SN38)-conjugated OPDEA micelles of 30 nm had much enhanced antitumor activity compared with the 140 nm micelles. These results are instructive for the design of active cancer nanomedicine."
"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies that target programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway are currently used for the treatment of various cancer types. However, low response rates of ICB remain the major issue and limit their applications in clinic. Here, we developed a ROS-responsive synergistic delivery system (pep-PAPM@PTX) by integrating physically-encapsulated paclitaxel (PTX) and surface-modified anti-PD-L1 peptide (pep) for combined chemotherapy and ICB therapy. Pep-PAPM@PTX could bind the cell surface PD-L1 and drive its recycling to lysosomal degradation, thus reverting PTX-induced PD-L1 upregulation and downregulating PD-L1 expression. As a result, pep-PAPM@PTX significantly promoted T cell infiltration and increased tumor immunoactivating factors, synergizing PTX chemotherapy to achieve enhanced anticancer potency in a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) model."
"Fluorescence is routinely used for in vivo tracking and imaging of molecules and nanostructures with assuming that the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the dye concentration. Herein, we report the unique tumor-specific fluorescence character of rhodamine B isothiocyanate derivatives (RBITCs), which emits fluorescence selectively in cancerous tissues, including small metastatic tumors, but is quenched in blood and healthy tissues. A preliminary mechanism study shows that binding of the thiourea group in the RBITCs on hemoglobin quenches their fluorescence, but the oxidation of the thiourea by the elevated reactive oxygen species in tumor activates the fluorescence. Thus, the fluorescent intensity of RBITCs is associated with the microenvironment of tissues and positively correlates with the cancer stages. These findings suggest that the RBITCs are not suitable for tracking of cargos in the presence of red blood cells but may be useful for cancer imaging and early diagnosis, and probing the tumor microenvironment."
"The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of tumors is much more complex than initially defined, and it alone is not sufficient for targeted delivery of nanosized agents. Meanwhile, poor tumor penetration is another major challenge for the treatment of solid tumors using nanoparticles. Development of delivery systems for SN38, the active metabolite of CPT-11 in human and a very potent anticancer molecule, has become an attractive research area. PEGx -p(HEMASN38)y (x and y are viable), a prodrug synthesized by using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as initiator and SN38 as monomer through atom transfer radical polymeration (ATRP) method, is previously reported. Using PEG2.4K -p(HEMASN38)3K as a model prodrug, herein an active-targeted strategy decorated with cys-arg-gly-asp-lys (CRGDK), a peptide specifically binds to neuropilin-1 overexpressed by tumor vessels and tumor cells, is successfully established to further improve the delivery and efficacy of SN38. CRGDK-functionalized PEG2.4K -p(HEMASN38)3K (C-SN38) nanoparticles and nonfunctionalized control (B-SN38) are prepared with two distinct sizes, 30 and 100 nm. Their physiochemical and biological characteristics are investigated in vitro and in vivo with multiple tumor models. It is demonstrated for the first time that CRGDK functionalization can be a promising strategy for efficient delivery of SN38, and C-SN38 is a potent drug candidate for the treatment of neuropilin-1 overexpressing tumors."

There, the cationic polymer is oxidized by intracellular reaction oxygen species, becomes negatively charged, and releases DNA efficiently. This vector delivering suicide genes achieves significantly better inhibition of tumor growth than doxorubicin, making it a candidate for further study in gene therapy and cancer treatment."

NCM is demonstrated to produce benign, stable nanoparticles made of PEG-b-PLLA-b-PCL triblock copolymers that are not only solvent-free and paclitaxel-rich, which reduces the body exposure to the excipients, but also nearly burst-release-free, which reduces if not eliminates its toxic side effects while enhancing its therapeutic efficacy."

" of basic polypeptide with antibacterial properties, antimicrobial peptides play an important role in resisting the invasion of foreign microorganisms. Antimicrobial peptides have a wide range of antimicrobial activities against bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microorganisms. They are active against traditional antibiotic-resistant strains and do not easily cause bacterial resistance. In this study, we synthesized an antibacterial peptide library by a Fmoc solid phase synthesis method, and screened the peptide chain FWKFK by modified cell membrane chromatography. The minimum inhibitory concentration of FWKFK against E. coli and S. aureus was 200 μg mL-1 and 250 μg mL-1, respectively, and FWKFK also had inhibitory effects on P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis and S. epidermidis. Its biocompatibility and therapeutic effect on mouse wounds were then tested. The results showed that the survival rate of normal cells after FWKFK treatment was more than 95%, the hemolysis rate of red blood cells was as low as 6%, and it had a significant effect on wound healing in mice."
"Cancer drug delivery systems often suffer from premature drug leakage during transportation and/or inefficient drug release within cancer cells. We present here a polymeric prodrug nanoassembly that addresses these problems simultaneously. This nanoassembly comprises a polymeric prodrug with novel trivalent phenylboronate moieties for drug conjugation via ether linkages, as well as β-lapachone (Lapa). While the ether linkage enables nearly no drug release under physiological conditions, the Lapa molecules can induce the reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst specifically in cancer cells via NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1 catalysis, which triggers the cleavage of the ether bonds and thus cascade amplification drug release in cancer cells. As a result, the nanoassemblies exhibit much higher cytotoxicity against cancer cells than normal cells, and also increased therapeutic efficacy and reduced side effects compared to the clinically used irinotecan. We anticipate that this strategy can be applied to other drug delivery platforms to enable more precise drug release."
"in corona can significantly modulate the physicochemical properties and gene delivery of polyethylenimine (PEI)/DNA complexes (polyplexes). The effects of the protein corona on the transfection have been well studied in terms of averaged gene expression in a whole cell population. Such evaluation methods give excellent and reliable statistics, but they in general provide the final transfection efficiency without reflecting the dynamic process of gene expression. In this regard the influence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) on the gene expression of PEI polyplexes also on a single cell level via live imaging is analyzed. The results reveal that although the BSA corona causes difference in the overall gene expression and mRNA transcription, the gene expression behavior on the level of individual cell is similar, including the mitosis‐dependent expression, distributions of onset time, expression pattern in two daughter cells, and expression kinetics in successfully transfected cells. Comparison of single cell and ensemble data on whole cell cultures indicate that the protein corona does not alter the transfection process after nuclear entry, including cell division, polyplex dissociation, and protein expression. Its influence on other steps of in vitro gene delivery before nuclear entry shall render the difference in the overall transfection."

Gel penetration chromatography (GPC) was performed on a Wyatt GPC/SEC-MALS (Wyatt Technology Corporation, Santa Barbara, USA) system equipped with an Optilab® T-rEXTM refractive index detector at 50 ºC using DMF containing 50 mM LiBr as eluent at a flow rate of 0.80 mL/min. Data were recorded and processed with ASTRA v6.0 software. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was recorded on an Agilent 1260 Infinity II (Agilent Technologies) system equipped with an UV and FLV detectors using acetonitrile/water as eluent. Data were recorded and processed with software. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was performed on a Bruker ultrafleXtreme™ MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics GmbH, using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) as the matrix.

The sizes and zeta potentials of micelles were measured by on a Malvern Nano ZS Zetasizer (Malvern Instrument Ltd., UK) with He-Ne laser light (632.8 nm) at 173° scattering angle at 25 °C. The volume-averaged diameter was obtained from the instrument’s Dispersion Technology Software version 6.1. The morphologies of micelles were observed using a JEM-1200EX TEM operated at a voltage of 80 kV. Micelles solution (1 mg/mL) was applied onto a 150-mesh copper grid and stained with 1% (w/v) aqueous uranyl acetate before observation."
"Cancer treatment has always been a big problem for people. With the application of photodynamic therapy, the problem has been alleviated. However, the problem of tumor hypoxia affecting photodynamic therapy has been waiting to be resolved. Therefore, we report here that a redox nanocarrier (called RN) is prepared by hollow mesoporous silica sphere (HMSNs) and a redox-responsive polymer ligand. The nanocarrier is loaded with metformin and catalase, and the polymer is linked to the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6). Metformin inhibits the mitochondrial respiration of cancer cells, reducing the activity of cancer cells and increasing the oxygen concentration required for photodynamic therapy. Not only the effect of photodynamic therapy is enhanced, but also the effect of chemotherapy is increased to achieve super additive treatment. These RNs exhibit not only low cytotoxicity but also high biocompatibility in vitro experiments. In vitro Ce6 release studies have shown a higher release in the presence of glutathione (GSH). Confocal microscopy can further indicate that the nanoparticles are carried to the area around the nucleus of the cancer cells. In addition, treatment with a mouse tumor model demonstrated that RN has an effective therapeutic effect on tumors."
"Disulfiram (DSF) exerts potent anticancer activity via the formation of chelates with copper or zinc ions in tumor tissues, but the low abundance of these ions in the tumor cannot sustain its antitumor activity. Herein, we show that a zwitterionic water-soluble N-oxide polymer, poly[2-(N-oxide-N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (OPDMA), can complex cupric ions and form nanogels (OPDMA/Cu), which efficiently deliver copper ions to tumor tissue to potentiate DSF significantly for effective antitumor therapy."
"Dendrimers have become effective drug carriers and gene transfection vectors for medical biomaterials. In this experiment, UCNPs (NaGdF4:Tm, Yb@NaGdF4) and three-generation PAMAM dendrimers were prepared firstly; then NaGdF4:Tm, Yb@NaGdF4 was modified by Polyacrylic acid(PAA); PAMAM were grafted to the surface of the modified UCNPs by the reaction between amino groups and carboxyl groups; finally, O-nitrobenzaldehyde was grafted to the surface by Schiff base reaction.The synthesized upconversion materials were coated with PAA and PAMAM, then loaded with O-nitrobenzaldehyde to form spherical nanoparticles. The particle size of prepared nanoparticles is 75 ∼ 80 nm. The dendrimer complex can emit ultraviolet light to regulate the pH gradient of aqueous solution under the excitation of near-infrared light (980 nm), and can be used to kill cancer cells by changing the acidity of tissue cells; secondly, the cavity between dendrimers and dendrimers on the surface of the complex can be used in many fields such as drug delivery and gene transfection; the nanoparticles provide a new method for cancer treatment."

"rivatized monomer 6-undecyl-1-(4-vinylbenzyl)uracil and diaminopyrimidine-derivatized monomer 2,6-dioctanoylamido-4-methacryloyloxypyrimidine (DMP) were synthesized and polymerized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). A well-defined, highly soluble, uracil-containing polymer, poly[6-undecyl-1-(4-vinylbenzyl)uracil] (PUVU), was prepared in dioxane at 90 °C with CuBr/1,1,4,7,10,10-hexamethyltriethylenetetramine as the catalyst and methyl α-bromophenylacetate as the initiator. PUVU was further used as a template for the ATRP of DMP. The enhanced apparent rate constant of the DMP polymerization in the presence of PUVU indicated that the ATRP of DMP occurred along the PUVU template. The template polymerization produced a stable and insoluble macromolecular complex, PUVU/poly(2,6-dioctanoylamido-4-methacryloyloxypyrimidine). An X-ray diffraction study confirmed that the complex had strandlike domains. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci Part A: Polym Chem 44: 6607–6615, 2006"

"Immunotherapy is a new type of tumor treatment after surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and can be used to manage and destroy tumor cells through activating or strengthening the immune response. Immunotherapy has the benefits of a low recurrence rate and high specificity compared to traditional treatment methods. Immunotherapy has developed rapidly in recent years and has become a research hotspot. Currently, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors are the most effective tumor immunotherapies in clinical practice. While tumor immunotherapy brings hope to patients, it also faces some challenges and still requires continuous research and progress. Combination therapy is the future direction of anti-tumor treatment. In this review, the main focus is on an overview of the research progress of immune checkpoint inhibitors, cellular therapies, tumor vaccines, small molecule inhibitors and oncolytic virotherapy in tumor treatment, as well as the combination of immunotherapy with other treatments."

"In recent years, the efficacy of nano-drugs has not been significantly better than that of the drugs themselves, mainly because nano-drugs enter the tumor vasculature, stay near the blood vessels, and cannot enter the tumor tissues or tumor cells to complete the drug delivery process. Although intratumor injection can significantly decrease this risk, the side effects are strong. The advent of drug delivery carrier materials offers an opportunity to avoid the side effects of systemic drug delivery and the damage caused by tumor resection, holding great promise for the future of cancer therapy. Here, we systematically review recent research advances in the classification of drug delivery carrier materials and the delivery process in drug delivery systems. This review is divided into several main sections, first, we summarize the classification of tumor drug carrier materials, including drug delivery vectors and gene delivery vectors, etc., which are introduced in detail, respectively. Then we describe the carrier materials to deliver the drug cascade and the transition pathways for drug delivery, including stabilization transitions, charge inversions, and size changes. Finally, we discuss the current design strategies and research progress of drug vectors and provide a summary and outlook. This review aims to summarize different drug delivery vehicles and delivery processes to provide ideas for effective cancer therapy."

"Nanotheranostics (combined diagnosis and therapy) is emerging as an integral part of future therapeutic strategies. However, the development and fabrication of a nanotheranostic module involves multistep processes and always faces formulation challenges. The complexity involved in its multi-step formulations hinders its reproducible industrial production and clinical translation. Therefore, a facile synthesis of multifunctional nanotheranostics is critical to its translational success. In this report, we have developed a one-pot facile strategy to prepare a MRI-visible photothermal theranostic switchable module (T-SWITCH). These nanoparticles are synthesized through polymerization of levodopa together with the reduction of KMnO4 in the presence of silk sericin for the formation of manganese dioxide particles within the T-SWITCH. The synthesized T-SWITCH showed a uniform size distribution of around 95.77 nm and high longitudinal relaxivity coefficient (r1) of up to 61.94 mM-1 s-1. The reported r1 of the T-SWITCH is exceedingly higher than that of any other previously reported manganese-based contrast agents with first-rate in vitro and in vivo contrast enhancement capability. The T-SWITCH can be activated to switch its therapeutic mode using near-infrared (NIR) light. It exhibited strong excitable absorption in the safer and biological NIR window between 650 and 900 nm. We have validated the significant anti-cancer therapeutic efficacy of T-SWITCH both in vitro and in vivo through switchable photothermal therapy."
"degradable dendritic contrast agents (DCAs) based on polyester dendrimers were synthesized and characterized. The DCAs were stable at acidic pH, but hydrolyzed rapidly at physiological pH, which rendered the DCA's long-term Gd3+ retention as low as that of small molecule CAs. Their longitudinal relaxivities of 10.2 to 17.5 L·mmol−1·s−1 were about 2.4 to 4.1 times higher than that of DTPA-Gd, indicating their superior contrast-enhancing capability to the clinically used contrast agent. The in vivo MRI study suggested that the DCA at lower generation (G2-DTPA-Gd) could effectively enhance the MRI of tumor, while the one at higher generation (G5-DTPA-Gd) showed more potential in liver imaging."
"The control of the polymerization of a wide range of monomers under mild conditions by a single catalyst remains a major challenge in polymer science. We report a versatile, well-defined organocobalt salen complex to control living radical polymerization of different categories of monomers, including acrylates, acrylamides and vinyl acetate, under visible light irradiation at ambient temperature. Both household light and sunlight were effectively applied in the synthesis of polymers with controlled molecular weights and narrow polydispersities. Narrowly dispersed block copolymers (Mw/Mn < 1.2) were obtained under various conditions. The structures of the polymers were analyzed by 1H NMR, 2D NMR, 13C NMR, GPC, MALDI-TOF-MS and isotopic labeling experiments, which showed that the ω and α ends of the polymer chains were capped with (salen)Co and -CO2CH3 segments, respectively, from the photoinitiator (salen)Co-CO2CH3. The ω end was easily functionalized through oxygen insertion followed by hydrolysis from 18O2 to -18OH. This robust system can proceed without any additives, and offers a versatile and green way to produce well-defined homo and block copolymers."
"In recent years, nano-drug delivery systems have made considerable progress in the direction of tumor treatment, but the low permeability of drugs has restricted the development of nano drugs. To solve this problem, we constructed a nano-drug delivery system with the dual effects of γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) reaction and high nuclear targeting in tumor microenvironment to promote the deep penetration of drugs. Over-expression of GGT in tumor cells can specifically recognize γ-glutamyl substrate and release amino group from the hydrolysis reaction, which makes the whole system change from negative or neutral to positive charge system. The conjugated complex with positive charge rapidly endocytosis through electrostatic interaction, enhancing its permeability in tumor parenchyma. At the same time, the cell penetrating TAT contains a large amount of lysine, which can be identified by the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) on the surface of the nuclear membrane, showing excellent nuclear localization function. The active DOX is released in the nucleus, which inhibits the mitosis of cancer cells and enhances the active transport ability of drugs in tumor cells. Therefore, this drug delivery system actively transports adriamycin into the tumor to achieve deep penetration of drugs through enzyme response and nuclear targeting, showing high anti-tumor activity and can be effectively applied to the treatment of liver cancer."
"elivery and release of therapeutics in the subcellular targets are critical for tumor‐selective chemotherapy. Self‐immolative structures are sophisticatedly designed to achieve stimuli‐responsive drug delivery. Herein, the facile fabrication of self‐immolative peptide‐camptothecin (CPT) nanoassemblies is reported for cancer‐selective drug delivery by utilizing the dual‐mode peptide targeting design and amine‐catalyzed intramolecular hydrolysis. The dual‐mode peptide targeting design is realized by co‐assembly of tumor targeting and nuclei‐localizing peptide‐CPT prodrugs, rendering the nanoassemblies with efficient cancer cell‐selective capability. When the nanoassemblies enter cancer cell, the overexpressed endonuclear histone deacetylases (HDACs) cleave the acetyl group to generate primary amines, triggers amine‐catalyzed intramolecular hydrolysis, and fast‐release drug in the cell nuclei. The peptide‐CPT prodrugs release up to 68% CPT in 1 h in the presence of HDACs, while no detectable CPT release is observed in the absence of HDACs at the same time. The peptide‐CPT prodrugs selectively kill cancer cells with high HDACs levels. The dual targeting peptide‐CPT nanoassemblies exhibit extended blood circulation, excellent tumor accumulation, and potent antitumor activity by inhibiting tumor progression and metastasis in mice bearing 4T1 aggressive breast tumors. Overall, the HDAC‐triggered self‐immolative strategy is promising for developing cancer‐selective drug delivery systems."
"apy is one of the most commonly used clinical antitumor strategies. However, the therapy-induced proliferative burst, which always accompanies drug resistance and metastasis, has become a major obstacle during treatment. Except for some endogenous cellular or genetic mechanisms and some microenvironmental selection pressures, the intercellular connections in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are also thought to be the driving force for the acquired drug resistance and proliferative burst. Even though some pathway inhibitors or cell exempting strategies could be applied to partially avoid these unwanted communications, the complexity of the TME and the limited knowledge about those unknown detrimental connections might greatly compromise the efforts. Therefore, a more broad-spectrum strategy is urgently needed to relieve the drug-induced burst proliferation during various treatments. In this article, based on the possible discrepancies in metabolic activity between cells with different growth rates, several ester-bond-based prodrugs were synthesized. After screening, 7-ethyl-10-hyodroxycamptothecin-based prodrug nanoparticles were found to efficiently overcome the paclitaxel resistance, to selectively act on the malignantly proliferated drug-resistant cells and, furthermore, to greatly diminish the proliferative effect of common cytotoxic agents by blocking the detrimental intercellular connections. With the discriminating ability against malignant proliferating cells, the as-prepared prodrug nanomedicine exhibited significant anticancer efficacy against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tumor models, either by itself or by combining with highly potent nonselective chemotherapeutics. This work provides a different perspective and a possible solution for the treatment of therapy-induced burst proliferation."
"Peptide dendrimers have a broad application in biomedical science due to their biocompatibility, diversity, and multifunctionality, but the precision synthesis of high-molecule weight peptide dendrimers remains challenging. We here report the facile and liquid-phase synthesis of molecular level precision and amino-acid built-in polylysine (PLL) dendrimers with molecular weights as high as ∼60 kDa. Three types of polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane (POSS)-cored PLL dendrimers with phenylalanine, tyrosine, or histidine as building blocks were synthesized. The precise structures of the dendrimers were confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS, GPC, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The interior functionalized peptide dendrimers improved the encapsulation capability of SN38 and sustained the release profiles. Enhanced molecular interactions between the peptide dendrimers and drugs were explored by both NMR experiments and computer simulations. The peptide dendrimer/SN38 formulations showed potent antitumor activity against multiple cancer cell lines. We believe that this strategy can be applied to the synthesis of tailor-made functional peptide dendrimers for drug-specific delivery and other diverse biomedical applications."

"In recent years, carbon dots have shown great potential in biological imaging, drug delivery, and other fields. In this study, red fluorescent carbon dots with carboxyl functional groups on the surface were designed and prepared, and the fluorescence properties were studied. At the same time, the carbon dot was combined with dendritic macromolecules, and the aggregate particle size was about 25nm. This combination has good dispersion and stability in both water and methanol, and the DOX-loaded is about 6.72%. The small particle size makes it easy to enter the cells, so as to achieve the function of tumor treatment and cell imaging."
"Cancer remains a highly lethal disease in the world. Currently, either conventional cancer therapies or modern immunotherapies are non-tumor-targeted therapeutic approaches that cannot accurately distinguish malignant cells from healthy ones, giving rise to multiple undesired side effects. Recent advances in nanotechnology, accompanied by our growing understanding of cancer biology and nano-bio interactions, have led to the development of a series of nanocarriers, which aim to improve the therapeutic efficacy while reducing off-target toxicity of the encapsulated anticancer agents through tumor tissue-, cell-, or organelle-specific targeting. However, the vast majority of nanocarriers do not possess hierarchical targeting capability, and their therapeutic indices are often compromised by either poor tumor accumulation, inefficient cellular internalization, or inaccurate subcellular localization. This Review outlines current and prospective strategies in the design of tumor tissue-, cell-, and organelle-targeted cancer nanomedicines, and highlights the latest progress in hierarchical targeting technologies that can dynamically integrate these three different stages of static tumor targeting to maximize therapeutic outcomes. Finally, we briefly discuss the current challenges and future opportunities for the clinical translation of cancer nanomedicines."

"A novel approach to hyperbranched polymers is presented in this work. Hyperbranched polyesters with a large amount of terminal hydroxyl groups are prepared by a one-pot synthesis from commercially available AB-type and CD(n)-type monomers (n >/= 2). In this paper, Michael addition of diethanolamine (CD(2)) or N-methyl-d-glucamine (CD(5)) to methyl acrylate (AB) generates dominantly AD(n)-type intermediates. Further self-condensation of intermediates at higher temperature and in the presence of catalyst gives hyperbranched polyesters. Because of the tertiary amino groups in the backbone and the hydroxyl groups in the linear and terminal units, the resulting hyperbranched polyester is highly soluble in water. Furthermore, the hyperbranched polymer is degradable because of its ester units. So, the water-soluble hyperbranched polyesters might be applied as a novel material for drug delivery."

"Modern medicine has increasingly higher requirements for antibacterial materials. To overcome this challenge, we use alkynyl monomers, amino monomers, formaldehyde, and acetic acid as raw materials to synthesize a series of poly-tetrahydropyrimidine (P-THP) polymers through multicomponent polymerizations (MCPs). P-THP polymers can effectively inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia. coli, E. coli), and can prevent bacteria from developing drug resistance within at least 16 generations. Besides, we prepared P-THP antibacterial coatings and explored their antibacterial properties. In vitro antibacterial experiments showed that P-THP coatings can prevent the formation of bacterial biofilms, and the coatings have a lasting killing effect on E. coli and S. aureus. The mouse wound infection experiments proved that P-THP polymers can significantly accelerate skin tissue regeneration and wound healing. Moreover, the P-THP textile obtained by electrospinning also has antibacterial properties and has great application prospects in the field of N95 masks. Generally speaking, P-THP polymers have considerable application potential in the field of treating bacterial infections and promoting wound healing."

"We herein present a facile approach to create polydopamine (PDA) modified silica-based nanocarriers for use in the encapsulation and photothermally responsive release of the synthetic sandalwood odorant Sandalore (SA) as a low-volatile model fragrance. The method involves impregnating mesoporous silica nanoparticles with an ethanol solution of SA followed by surface functionalization via the in situ self-polymerization of dopamine under alkaline conditions. The resulted nanocomposites have high fragrance loading capacity with up to ∼85% by weight of SA relative to the silica matrix and are capable of effectively preserving the cargo in the dark or indoors. The aroma release was significantly accelerated upon illumination due to the photothermal heating effect of the PDA shell, which is proportional to the coating content and the irradiation intensity. Additionally, the emulated laundry tests showed that the composites exhibited a higher deposition efficiency on the fabric surface and better washing-resistance as compared to the control particles without PDA coating."
"Highly permeable pocket-shaped microfiltration membranes with binary porous structures, which are composed of brominated poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (BPPO), were prepared on needles by breath figure (BF) and colloidal crystal template (CCT) methods. In colloidal crystal templates, the membrane pore size in the bottom layer was adjusted by SiO2 microsphere diameter in the colloidal crystal template, while that in the top layer was adjusted by changing the BPPO concentration. The permeability of the binary porous membrane prepared by BF and CCT methods was higher than that of membranes only prepared by the BF method. Due to high permeability and antifouling properties, the pocket shaped binary porous membrane was connected to a syringe and used as a filter film in microfiltration and sample preparation fields."

"Doxorubicin is an effective anthracycline used for cancer therapy. However, the clinical application of doxorubicin has been largely limited by its irreversible cardiotoxicity, which is mainly induced by the primary amine group. In this study, we structurally modified doxorubicin by converting the primary amine into an acid-labile amide before assessing the acute cardiac effect of doxorubicin (pristine or modified) on cardiomyocyte contractile function. Contractile properties of murine cardiomyocytes were analyzed including peak shortening (PS), time-to-PS (TPS), time-to-90% relengthening (TR(90)) and maximal velocity of shortening/re-lengthening (+/-dL/dt). Cell toxicity and survival rate were evaluated using the MTT assay. The doxorubicin-free base was amidized by reacting with 3,4,5,6-tetrahydophthalic anhydride (THPA) or 3,3,4,4-tetramethylsuccinic anhydride (TMSA) to yield doxorubicin-THPA or -TMSA. Acute exposure of pristine doxorubicin (10(-9)-10(-5)M) for 30 min significantly prolonged TPS and TR(90) without affecting PS and +/-dL/dt. Interestingly, doxorubicin-induced prolongation of TPS and TR(90) was significantly attenuated or abrogated by amidization of doxorubicin. Neither doxorubicin-THPA nor -TMSA affected PS and +/-dL/dt. ROS and MTT assay revealed significantly reduced ROS production and cardiac cell toxicity from amidized doxorubicin compared with the pristine compound. Comparable cytotoxicity in human ovarian cancer SKOV-3 cells was observed between amidized and pristine doxorubicin compounds. These data provide evidence for the first time that structural modification of doxorubicin alleviates its cardiac toxicity."

"The successful delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules into solid tumor holds great challenge due to their high resistance to penetrate through the complex tumor microenvironments. Here, active-transporting nanoparticles are harnessed to efficiently deliver biomacromolecular drugs into solid tumors through cell transcytosis. A series of molecularly precise cyanine 5-cored polylysine G5 dendrimers (Cy5 nanodots) with different peripheral amino acids (G5-AA) is prepared. The capability of these positively charged nanodots to induce cell endocytosis, exocytosis, and transcytosis is evaluated via fluorescence-based high-throughput screen. The optimized nanodots (G5-R) are conjugated with αPD-L1 (a therapeutic monoclonal antibody binding to programmed-death ligand 1) (αPD-L1-G5-R) to demonstrate the nanoparticle-mediated tumor active transport. The αPD-L1-G5-R can greatly enhance the tumor-penetration capability through adsorption-mediated transcytosis (AMT). The effectiveness of αPD-L1-G5-R is tested in treating mice bearing partially resected CT26 tumors, mimicking the local immunotherapy of residual tumors post-surgery in clinic. The αPD-L1-G5-R embedded in fibrin gel can efficiently mediate tumor cell transcytosis, and deliver αPD-L1 throughout the tumor, thereby enhancing immune checkpoint blockade, reducing tumor recurrence, and significantly prolonging the survival time. The active-transporting nanodots are promising platforms for efficient tumor delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules."
"A rapid and comprehensive assessment of ischemic stroke (IS) is critical for clinicians to take the most appropriate treatment. Currently, IS assessment is mainly carried out by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in combination with observing the clinical symptoms and inquiring about contraindications. However, they cannot diagnose pathological conditions and judge the microenvironment in real-time. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging has advantages for IS imaging, such as high sensitivity, high spatiotemporal resolution, and straightforward real-time operation. Herein, a pH-responsive fluorescent liposomal probe (BOD@Lip) is prepared for in vivo real-time visualization of the degree of IS based on the different acid microenvironments in the progression of the disease. The fluorescence imaging with BOD@Lip shows the degree of IS, and the correlation between fluorescence signals and the neurological deficit scores is established for the first time. This work provides a new method to objectively evaluate the degree of IS through a visualized route and a new insight into the relationship between the acidic microenvironment and the progression of IS."

"In recent years, preparation of metal nanoparticles has developed a matter of great interest in overcoming different challenges such as environmental pollutants and infectious diseases. Herein, biogenic synthesis of iron nanoparticles (FeNPs) was achieved using aqueous peels extract of Ficus carica as a reducing and stabilizing agent. The structure and properties of the synthesized Iron nanoparticles were investigated by SEM, EDX, TEM, FTIR and UV–Vis spectroscopy, and further assessed for their photocatalytic activity. A great photocatalytic degradation had been observed upon treatment of FeNPs with methylene blue dye. It reached near 81% for methylene blue after 30 hrs. These results confirmed that the synthesis of FeNPs by green chemistry improves its properties and can be utilized as a promising strategy for photocatalytic and other applications."
"Polymeric micelles (PMs) have been applied widely to transport hydrophobic drugs to tumor sites for cancer treatment. However, the low load efficiency of the drug in the PMs significantly reduces the therapeutic efficiency.

Moreover, the dimeric CPT-loaded PCL-PEG-PCL PMs exhibited excellent solubility in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) media and significant cytotoxicity to cancer cells."
"The majority of anticancer drugs have poor aqueous solubility, produce adverse effects in healthy tissue, and thus impose major limitations on both clinical efficacy and therapeutic safety of cancer chemotherapy. To help circumvent problems associated with solubility, most cancer drugs are now formulated with co-solubilizers. However, these agents often also introduce severe side effects, thereby restricting effective treatment and patient quality of life. A promising approach to addressing problems in anticancer drug solubility and selectivity is their conjugation with polymeric carriers to form polymer-based prodrugs. These polymer-based prodrugs are macromolecular carriers, designed to increase the aqueous solubility of antitumor drugs, can enhance bioavailability. Additionally, polymer-based prodrugs approach exploits unique features of tumor physiology to passively facilitate intratumoral accumulation, and so improve chemodrug pharmacokinetics and pharmacological properties. This review introduces basic concepts of polymer-based prodrugs, provides an overview of currently emerging synthetic, natural, and genetically engineered polymers that now deliver anticancer drugs in preclinical or clinical trials, and highlights their major anticipated applications in anticancer therapies."

"solutions of polystyrene-block-polybutadiene and polystyrene-block-polyisoprene in propane are found to exhibit significantly lower cloud pressures than the corresponding hypothetical nonmicellar solutions. Such a cloud-pressure reduction indicates the extent to which micelle formation enhances the apparent diblock solubility in near-critical and hence compressible propane. Concentration-dependent pressure−temperature points beyond which no micelles can be formed, referred to as the micellization end points, are found to depend on the block type, size, and ratio. The cloud-pressure reduction and the micellization end point measured for styrene−diene diblocks in propane should be characteristic of all amphiphilic diblock copolymer solutions that form micelles in compressible solvents."

"lkylamides are important functional initiators for anionic polymerization of methacrylates, but only sterically hindered ones can initiate a successful living polymerization.

Dimethylacrylamide (DMA) and tert-butyl methacrylate (tBMA) were found to be effective capping agents for lithium diallylamide. After capped with DMA or tBMA, the initiator efficiency of lithium diallylamide was increased from 0.1 to 0.9 for various monomers. Monosubstituted lithium alkylamides (vinyloxypropylamide and allylamide) could not directly initiate the polymerization of methacrylates due to severe reaction with the carbonyl groups in the monomers. After capped with DMA, the initiators polymerized methacrylates with initiator efficiency about 0.4−0.6, depending on the monomer type. tBMA was not suitable as capping agent for the monosubstituted lithium amides.

"Dendritic cells (DCs), the primary antigen-presenting cells in the immune system, play a critical role in regulating tumor immune responses. However, the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment severely impedes the process of antigen-presenting and DC maturation, thereby limiting the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. In this work, a pH-responsive polymer nanocarrier (PAG) modified with aminoguanidine (AG) was constructed for the efficient delivery of bortezomib (BTZ) through bidentate hydrogen bonds and electrostatic adsorption formed between guanidine groups of PAG and boronic acid groups of BTZ. The obtained PAG/BTZ nanoparticles exhibited pH-responsive release of BTZ and AG in the acidic tumor microenvironment. On the one hand, BTZ induced potent immune activation by eliciting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and releasing damage-associated molecular patterns. On the other hand, the cationic AG significantly promoted antigen uptake by DCs and activated DC maturation. As a result, PAG/BTZ significantly stimulated tumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and triggered robust antitumor immune responses. Thus, it showed potent antitumor efficacy when synergizing with an immune checkpoint-blocking antibody."

"Upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) are promising, new imaging probes capable of serving as multimodal contrast agents. In this study, monodisperse and ultrasmall core and core-shell UCNPs were synthesized via a thermal decomposition method. Furthermore, it was shown that the epitaxial growth of a NaGdF4 optical inert layer covering the NaGdF4:Yb,Er core effectively minimizes surface quenching due to the spatial isolation of the core from the surroundings. The mean diameter of the synthesized core and core-shell nanoparticles was ≈8 and ≈16 nm, respectively. Hydrophobic UCNPs were converted into hydrophilic ones using a nonionic surfactant Tween 80. The successful coating of the UCNPs by Tween 80 has been confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence (PL) spectra and magnetic resonance (MR) T1 relaxation measurements were used to characterize the size, crystal structure, optical and magnetic properties of the core and core-shell nanoparticles. Moreover, Tween 80-coated core-shell nanoparticles presented enhanced optical and MR signal intensity, good colloidal stability, low cytotoxicity and nonspecific internalization into two different breast cancer cell lines, which indicates that these nanoparticles could be applied as an efficient, dual-modal contrast probe for in vivo bioimaging."
"sure solutions of polystyrene-block-polybutadiene and polystyrene-block-polyisoprene in compressible propane or propylene exhibit a robust micellar region that grows in pressure−temperature coordinates with increasing copolymer concentration, molecular weight, and styrene/diene block ratio. This happens because, while the micellization pressure strongly increases with increasing copolymer concentration, molecular weight, and styrene/diene block ratio, the micellar cloud pressure (the pressure at which the micelles aggregate and precipitate from solution) is largely insensitive to these variables. In other words, neither the block size nor the block ratio nor the copolymer concentration seems to affect much the copolymer separation from solution in the micellar region."

"The goal of inhibiting tumor growth can be achieved by cutting off the supply of nutrients in the blood vessels of a tumor site, but finding ways to effectively, accurately and safely deliver drugs that can induce vascular embolism remains a challenge. Phase change materials (PCM) can undergo solid-liquid transformation at the phase change temperature. This study reports on a near-infrared ray (NIR)-responsive nano-drug delivery platform based on Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles. The PCM (lauric acid) can encapsulate thrombin (Thr) in the Prussian blue nanocage (PB Cage), and effectively avoid the pre-leakage of Thr during blood circulation. When the (Thr/PCM)@PB Cage is accumulated at the tumor site and irradiated with NIR, the thermal effect induced by the PB Cage causes the PCM to undergo a solid-liquid state transition, rapidly releasing the encapsulated Thr and inducing coagulation in the tumor blood vessels. Based on the safe delivery and precisely controlled release of Thr, the proliferation of tumor cells can be inhibited without damaging other tissues and organs. In addition, PB Cage-induced photothermal therapy can also ablate tumor cells. Thr-induced ""starvation therapy"" based on PB Cage loading provides a good reference for precise controlled-release drug delivery systems."
"Biomedicine is developing rapidly in the 21st century. Among them, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of peptide biomarkers is of considerable importance for the diagnosis and therapy of diseases and the quality evaluation of drugs and food. The identification and quantitative analysis of peptides have been going on for decades. Traditionally, immunoassays or biological assays are generally used to quantify peptides in biological matrices. However, the selectivity and sensitivity of these methods cannot meet the requirements of the application. The separation and analysis technique of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) supplies a reliable alternative.

The resulting close-packed colloidal crystal was infiltrated with a reactive monomer solution. After polymerization, the silica spheres were etched away, resulting in an ICC membrane with Fe3O4 nanoparticles inside. The typical ICC membrane was characterized by SEM and XRD. Meanwhile, We used the KCl diffusion to test the permeability of the membrane. The results illustrated that the highly ordered permeable polymer membrane was successfully prepared by using Fe3O4@SiO2 colloidal crystals as the templates. Furthermore, the functional ICC membrane exhibited excellent magnetic-responsive gating property to separation.

"Multifunctional nanocomposite has a huge potential for cell imaging, drug delivery, and improving therapeutic effect with less side effects. To date, diverse approaches have been demonstrated to endow a single nanostructure with multifunctionality. Herein, we report the synthesis and application of core-shell nanoparticles composed with upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) as a core and a graphene oxide quantum dot (GOQD) as a shell. The UCNP was prepared and applied for imaging-guided analyses of upconversion luminescence. GOQD was prepared and employed as promising drug delivery vehicles to improve anti-tumor therapy effect in this study. Unique properties of UCNPs and GOQDs were incorporated into a single nanostructure to provide desirable functions for cell imaging and drug delivery. In addition, hypocrellin A (HA) was loaded on GOQDs for photo-dynamic therapy (PDT). HA, a commonly used chemotherapy drug and a photo-sensitizer, was conjugated with GOQD by π-π interaction and loaded on PEGylated UCNP without complicated synthetic process, which can break structure of HA. Applying these core-shell nanoparticles to MTT assay, we demonstrated that the UCNPs with GOQD shell loaded with HA could be excellent candidates as multifunctional agents for cell imaging, drug delivery and cell therapy."

In this paper, we will discuss the continuity of the mapping V : Q(X) → Q(X) defined by and also of the inverse mapping V-1, obtaining some Lakic-type results concerning the geometry of Teichmuller spaces."
"ics targeting immune checkpoints have achieved astonishing clinical success in cancer treatment. However, these therapies can hardly adapt to immunologically “cold” tumors featuring insufficient and exhausted tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes as well as low immunogenicity. Herein, a two‐pronged strategy is presented by combining cryo‐shocked M1 macrophages (CSMs) and CD47‐targeted lonidamine nanodrugs (CLNDN) for reprograming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). CSMs induce durable polarization of tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) into the immunostimulatory M1 phenotype through the TLR2/MAPK signaling and also elevate CD47 expression in tumor cells, which in turn facilitates the targeted delivery of CLNDN into tumor cells. CLNDN trigger tumor cell‐specific pyroptosis through the caspase‐3/GSDME pathway and lead to the release of damage‐associated molecular patterns. Consequently, the combination of CSM and CLNDN synergistically boosts immune infiltration and tumor cell immunogenicity within the TME, effectively reverting tumor immunosuppression. This combination achieves potent antitumor effects and induces long‐term immune memory against tumor metastasis and recurrence. This work demonstrates for the first time TAM polarization by using cryo‐shocked macrophages and highlights its coordination with tumor pyroptosis for igniting tumor immunity, opening up a new avenue for robust cancer immunotherapy."
"The tumor entrance of drug delivery systems, including therapeutic proteins and nanomedicine, plays an essential role in affecting the treatment outcome. Nanoparticle size is a critical but contradictory factor in making a trade-off among blood circulation, tumor accumulation, and penetration. Here, this work designs a series of single-molecule gadolinium (Gd)-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) nanoprobes with well-defined sizes to precisely explore the size-dependent tumor entrance in vivo. The MRI nanoprobes obtained by divergent synthesis contain a core molecule of macrocyclic Gd(III)-chelate and different layers of dendritic lysine units, mimicking globular protein. This work finds that the r1 relaxivity and MR imaging signals increase with the nanoparticle size. The nanoprobe with a lower limit of critical size threshold ≈8.0 nm achieves superior tumor accumulation and penetration. These single-molecule MRI nanoprobes can be served to precisely examine the size-related nanoparticle-biological interactions."
"Gene therapy, as a revolutionary treatment, has been gaining more and more attention. The key to gene therapy is the selection of suitable vectors for protection of exogenous nucleic acid molecules and enabling their specific release in target cells. While viral vectors have been widely used in researches, non-viral vectors are receiving more attention due to its advantages. Chitosan (CS) has been widely used as non-viral organic gene carrier because of its good biocompatibility and its ability to load large amounts of nucleic acids. This paper summarizes and evaluates the potential of chitosan and its derivatives as gene delivery vector materials, along with factors influencing transfection efficiency, performance evaluation, ways to optimize infectious efficiency, and the current main research development directions. Additionally, it provides an outlook on its future prospects."
"Chemo-immunotherapy has made significant progress in cancer treatment. However, the cancer cell self-defense mechanisms, including cell cycle checkpoint and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) upregulation, have greatly hindered the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, norcantharidin (NCTD)-platinum (Pt) codelivery nanoparticles (NC-NP) with tumor-sensitive release profiles are designed to overcome the self-defense mechanisms via synergistic chemo-immunotherapy. NC-NP remains stable under normal physiological conditions but quickly releases 1,2-diaminocyclohexane-platinum(II) (DACHPt, a parent drug of oxaliplatin) and NCTD in response to the tumor acidity. NCTD inhibits protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity to relieve cell cycle arrest and downregulates the tumor PD-L1 expression to disrupt the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 interaction, synergistically enhancing Pt-based chemotherapy and immunogenic cell death-induced immunotherapy. As a result, NC-NP exhibits potent synergistic cytotoxicity and promotes T cell recruitment to generate robust antitumor immune responses. The dual synergism exhibits potent antitumor activity against orthotopic 4T1 tumors, providing a promising chemo-immunotherapy paradigm for cancer treatment."
"Molecular imaging of disease with multifunctional nanoparticles has improved specificity and sensitivity but also raises the complexity, potential toxicity, and cost. Here, we show a facile and degradable self-assembly β-cyclodextrin metal-organic framework (β-CD-MOF) nanoplatform for customizable multifunctional imaging. These β-CD-MOF nanoparticles were obtained with favorable morphology and size by controlling the degradation time. The β-CD-MOF were used as nanoplatforms for facile functionalization with adamantane (Ad)-modified probes through host-guest interactions between the surface β-CD units and Ad molecules. We demonstrated the method's feasibility and capability by developing various contrast agents for multiple biomedical imaging, including fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) imaging. The nanoprobes showed superior performance compared to the corresponding small molecular probes, including better physio-chemical properties (e.g., about 5 times of T1 relaxivity for MRI, 1.2 times of Hounsfield units for CT), improved pharmacokinetics, effective tissue imaging capability, and low safety concerns. These β-CD-MOF-based nanoparticles are promising host-guest nanoplatforms for developing multifunctional and safe imaging probes. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Molecular imaging of disease with multifunctional nanoparticles has improved specificity and sensitivity but also raises the complexity, potential toxicity, and cost. Here, we introduce facile and degradable self-assembly β-cyclodextrin metal-organic framework (β-CD-MOF) nanoplatforms for customizable multifunctional imaging.

"ased immune checkpoint inhibitors exhibit remarkable therapeutic benefits although their application is hindered by quick blood clearance and low affinity with receptors. The modification of the peptides into artificial antibodies is an ideal platform to solve these problems, and one of the optional pathways is the conjugation of peptides with a polymer. More importantly, the bridging effect, mediated by bispecific artificial antibodies, could promote the interaction of cancer cells and T cells, which will benefit cancer immunotherapy. Herein, a bispecific peptide‐polymer conjugate (octaPEG‐PD1‐PDL1) is prepared by simultaneously conjugating PD1‐binding and PDL1‐binding peptides onto 8‐arm‐PEG. octaPEG‐PD1‐PDL1 bridges T cells and cancer cells and thus enhances T cell‐mediated cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Meanwhile, the tumor‐targeting octaPEG‐PD1‐PDL1 increases the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in tumors and reduces their exhaustion. It effectively activates the tumor immune microenvironment and exerts a potent antitumor effect against CT26 tumor models with a tumor inhibition rate of 88.9%. This work provides a novel strategy to enhance tumor immunotherapy through conjugating bispecific peptides onto a hyperbranched polymer to effectively engage target‐effector cells."

"The active transport of nanoparticles into solid tumors through transcytosis has been recognized as a promising way to enhance tumor accumulation and penetration, but the effect of the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles remains unclear. Herein, we develop a type of single-molecule dual imaging nanodot by divergent growth of perylenediimide (PDI)-dye-cored polylysine dendrimers and internal orthogonal conjugation of Gd(III)-based macrocyclic probes for fluorescence imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of surface chemistry-dependent tumor entrance. The MRI and fluorescence imaging show that sixth-generation nanodots with acetylated (G6-Ac) and oligo ethylene glycol (G6-OEG) surfaces exhibit similar high tumor accumulation but different intratumor distribution. Cellular uptake and transport experiments suggest that G6-Ac nanodots have lower lysosomal entrapment (61% vs. 83%) and a higher exocytotic rate (47% vs. 29%) than G6-OEG. Therefore, G6-Ac is more likely to undergo intercellular transport through cell transcytosis, and is able to reach a tumor area distant from blood vessels, while G6-OEG mainly enters the tumor through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect-based passive transport, and is not able to deliver to distant tumor areas. This study suggests that it is possible to boost the tumor entrance of nanoparticles by engineering surface chemistry for active transport."
"anscytosis has recently sparked great interest in drug delivery as a novel route for tumor extravasation and infiltration. However, the rational design of transcytosis-inducing nanomedicines remains challenging. We recently demonstrated that the γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)-responsive polymer cationization induced efficient adsorption-mediated transcytosis (AMT). However, it remains unclear how the nanomedicines' physicochemical properties influence the GGT-responsive cationization and induced transcytosis behaviors. Herein, through a combination of experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find that the random copolymers with high hydrophobic monomers tend to form compact structures accessible to the catalytic site of GGT, leading to a fast cationization and thus high transcytosis efficiency, while the homopolymers of the hydrophilic GGT-sensitive monomers have elongated structures unable to enter the active site and thus exhibit poor GGT sensitivity. As a result, the more hydrophobic polymer-drug conjugates with high camptothecin contents exhibit higher GGT-responsive activity, which in turn leads to faster cationization and cellular internalization, enhanced tumor infiltration, and more potent antitumor activity. These findings indicate the hydrophobicity is a main parameter determining the GGT catalytic activity and transcytosis efficiency of the GGT-activatable co(homo)polymers, providing guidelines for the rational design of GGT-induced charge reversal carriers for transcytotic nanomedicines."

"High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is one of the most widely used separations and analysis methods, which has become an indispensable part of the separation and detection of mixtures, qualitative and quantitative analysis and other scientific research and social production fields. Because of the decisive effect of the chromatographic column on analysis and separation, it has become the core of research in the chromatographic system. In the past decades, the research and development of new chromatographic column stationary phase have been highly concerned. Monodisperse polymer microsphere, because of its special large pore structure, has good permeability and high specific surface area, which can be used as special materials in various fields, such as adsorption materials in the separation process, HPLC column packing, catalyst carrier, preparation template of nanomaterials and nuclear fusion targeting materials. When it is used in HPLC, because of the good permeability of microspheres, it can effectively improve the separation efficiency and performance. In this article, based on the previous work, a number of new polymer microspheres were prepared, and the prepared microspheres were used for the separation and detection of HPLC, and their physical and chemical properties were studied."

"Upconversion phosphors (UCPs) that are free from interference from biological sample autofluorescence have attracted attention for in vivo and in vitro bioapplications. However, UCPs need to be water-dispersible, nanosized, and highly luminous to realize broad applications. Therefore, the aim of this research is to develop UCPs that meet these comprehensive criteria for in vitro diagnosis. To combine nano size with high luminous intensity, β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ upconversion nanocrystals (UCNPs) codoped with Li+ and K+ are prepared that display high upconversion intensities as well as small size. The strongest green and red emissions of the Na0.9Li0.07K0.03YF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals are increased by 7 and 10 times, respectively, compared with those of the undoped NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals. A mild sol-gel surface modification method is used to produce water-phase dispersions and allow covalent biomolecule conjugation. The bioactivated UCNPs are used as a bioreporter and integrated with a classical lateral flow assay to establish an assay to accomplish simultaneous dual-target detection of Yersinia pestis and Burkholderia pseudomallei. The assay achieves a sensitivity of 103 CFU/test without cross-interference between two targets. The research provides a way to produce UCNPs with comprehensive properties for use as excellent optical reporters in in vivo and in vitro bioapplications."
"In this work, we synthesized a water-soluble unit based on fluorene, and using this water-soluble unit to polymerize with thiophene. We obtained a new type of water-soluble fluorescent polymer and performed a series of characterizations on it. The absorption peak of this polymer is around 390 nm. This polymer has excellent water solubility. And its aqueous solution has strong fluorescence in the visible region (∼420–550 nm)."
" years, encapsulation of fragrances and flavors in nanostructured matrices as well as related aromatic finishing techniques have emerged as promising means for achieving significant improvement of long-term release of flavor essence; therefore, understanding the interaction mechanism between nanocarriers and substrates is of vital importance for the application of fragrance nanotechnologies. In this work, the morphology, pore structure and pore size distribution of three kinds of animal and plant fiber materials were studied by taking silk fabric, cattle leather and wallpaper base paper as objects. Then, we investigated the adsorption property of the abovementioned fibrous substrates utilizing silica nanoparticles with different diameters as a simple model carrier. The results demonstrated that the adhesion strength and distribution of nanoparticles on the substrate are heavily dependent on their own size as well as on the fiber nature and the pore structure. Silica particles with a diameter of 20 nm can be strongly adsorbed on the fiber surface. For larger particles, such as 100, 500 and 1000 nm in diameters, they tend to be embedded in the gaps of the fiber or attached to the edge of the gaps. The preliminary studies could provide theoretical support for the design of fragrance-loaded nanoparticles and the development of long-lasting aromatic products."
"Recently, nanoplatforms with multiple functions, such as tumor-targeting drug carriers, MRI, optical imaging, thermal therapy etc., have become popular in the field of cancer research. The present study reports a novel multi-functional liposome for cancer theranostics. A dual targeted drug delivery with radiofrequency-triggered drug release and imaging based on the magnetic field influence was used advantageously for tumor multi-mechanism therapy. In this system, the surface of fullerene (C60) was decorated with iron oxide nanoparticles, and PEGylation formed a hybrid nanosystem (C60-Fe3O4-PEG2000). Thermosensitive liposomes (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, DPPC) with DSPE-PEG2000-folate wrapped up the hybrid nanosystem and docetaxel (DTX), which were designed to combine features of biological and physical (magnetic) drug targeting for fullerene radiofrequency-triggered drug release. The magnetic liposomes not only served as powerful tumor diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, but also as powerful agents for photothermal ablation of tumors. Furthermore, a remarkable thermal therapy combined chemotherapy multi-functional liposome nanoplatform converted radiofrequency energy into thermal energy to release drugs from thermosensitive liposomes, which was also observed during both in vitro and in vivo treatment. The multi-functional liposomes also could selectively kill cancer cells in highly localized regions via their excellent active tumor targeting and magnetic targeted abilities."

"ence of hepatic diseases continuously increases worldwide and causes significant mortality because of inefficient pharmacotherapy. Gene therapy is a new strategy in the treatment of hepatic diseases, but the disadvantages of insufficient retention in the liver and undesirable side effects hinder its application. In this study, we developed a novel nonviral vehicle targeted to liver. Mannan was cationized with spermine at varying grafted ratios to deliver the gene and was optimized in cytotoxicity and transfection in vitro. A spermine-mannan (SM)-based delivery system was proven to be hepatic targeted and was capable of prolonging the gene retention period in the liver. Moreover, SM at N/P of 20 was confirmed to be less interfered with by the serum. Optimized SM vehicle has relatively high hepatic transfection with almost no toxicity induction in the liver, which highlighted its potential in the treatment of hepatic diseases."

"Curcumin has been shown to have high cytotoxicity towards various cancer cell lines, but its water insolubility and instability make its bioavailability exceedingly low and, thus, it is generally inactive in in vivo anticancer tests. Here, we report an intracellular-labile amphiphilic surfactant-like curcumin prodrug--curcumin conjugated with two short oligo(ethylene glycol) (Curc-OEG) chains via beta-thioester bonds that are labile in the presence of intracellular glutathione and esterase. Curc-OEG formed stable nanoparticles in aqueous conditions and served two roles--as an anticancer prodrug and a drug carrier. As an anticancer prodrug, the formed nanoparticles had a high and fixed curcumin-loading content of 25.3 wt%, and released active curcumin in the intracellular environment. Curc-OEG had high inhibition ability to several cancer cell lines due to apoptosis. Intravenously injected Curc-OEG significantly reduced the tumor weights and tumor numbers in the athymic mice xenografted with intraperitoneal SKOV-3 tumors and subcutaneous (mammary fat pad) MDA-MB-468 tumors. Preliminary systemic toxicity studies found that Curc-OEG did not cause acute and subchronic toxicities to mouse visceral organs at high doses. As drug carriers, Curc-OEG nanoparticles could carry other anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin and camptothecin, and ship them into drug-resistant cells, greatly enhancing the cytotoxicity of the loaded drug. Thus, Curc-OEG is a promising prototype that merits further study for cancer therapy."
"The sulfur in gasoline will convert to SO(2) after combustion under high temperature, which adversely affects human health and the environment. Membrane technique in particular pervaporation offers a number of potential advantages over conventional FCC gasoline desulfurization processes. The present study focuses on the performance enhancement of PDMS membrane by incorporating silica nanoparticles. Specifically, silica nanoparticles formed by the catalysis and templating of protamine in w/o reverse microemulsion are in situ embedded into PDMS bulk matrix, endowing the resultant oleophilic nanocomposite membranes with appropriate free volume properties and superior separation performance. Through the rational manipulation of biomimetic mineralization at water-oil interface, silica particles with uniform size are acquired. Following this protocol, by introducing organic PDMS oligomers into the oil phase, PDMS-SiO(2) nanocomposite membranes are prepared in a facile way. The resultant nanocomposite membranes display superior permeability and permselectivity in the pervaporative desulfurization using thiophene/n-octane binary mixture as model gasoline, for example, under the condition of 500 ppm sulfur in feed (40 L/h) at 30°C, an enrichment factor of 4.83-5.82 with a normalized permeation rate of 6.61-10.76 × 10(-5)kgm/m(2)h is acquired."

"nt challenges persist in enhancing the delivery efficiency of tumor nanomedicines, predominantly due to the difficulty of successfully surpassing pathophysiological barriers. Enhancing tumor penetration of nanomedicines in such conditions represents a pivotal goal in advancing anticancer nanotherapeutics. Transcytosis emerges as a promising solution in this context, addressing the limitations of passive drug delivery. By harnessing diverse stimuli to induce transcytosis, nanocarriers can achieve precise drug delivery and deep tumor penetration, resulting in high therapeutic efficacy and reduced systemic exposure to the therapeutic compound. This review briefly examines various stimuli‐responsive nanosystems and offers an overview and outlook on the development of stimuli‐responsive nanocarriers for transcytosis‐based cancer drug delivery, aiming to provide informative insights for the design of nanomedicines capable of deep tissue penetration and enhanced therapeutic efficacy."

"In this work, we synthesized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and periodic mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles containing bridging groups of ethylene (E-PMO) and phenylene (P-PMO) and compared their adsorption properties using D-limonene (Lim), myrcene (Myr), and cymene (Cym) as model guest molecules. For the selected nanoparticles of ~100 nm in diameter, the loading capacity to the volatile fragrances was in the order of P-PMO < E-PMO < MSN, consistent with the trend of increasing total pore volume. For example, P-PMO, E-PMO, and MSN had a Lim uptake of 42.2 wt%, 47.3 wt%, and 62.7 wt%, respectively, which was close to their theoretical adsorption capacity. Under isothermal thermogravimetric analysis conditions (30 °C, a N2 flow of 1 mL min−1), the lowest fragrance release of ~56% over 24 h was observed for P-PMO, followed by E-PMO (74−80%), and MSN (~89%). The release kinetics of the fragrant molecules from MSN and PMO materials can be well described by first-order and Weibull models, respectively. Moreover, the incorporation of Lim-loaded P-PMO NPs in an aqueous solution of regenerated silk fibroin provided a composite coating material suitable for perishable fruit preservation. The active layer deposited on fruit peels using dip coating showed good preservation efficacy, enabling the shelf-life of mangoes in a highly humid and hot atmosphere (30−35 °C, 75−85% RH) to be extended to 6 days."
"m (DSF) is nontoxic and exerts anticancer activity by forming highly toxic chelates via its metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate with transition metal ions. However, there are not enough such ions in the human body to maintain the therapeutic effect. Herein, we report nanogels that complex copper ions or cis-platinum (CDDP) for tumor metal delivery to potentiate DSF's antitumor efficacy. We synthesized zwitterionic poly[N-(3-(methacryloyloxy-2-hydroxy)propyl)]-N-methyl glycine (PGMA-SAR) capable of chelating copper ions or CDDP and formed nanogels with suitable size and zeta potential. The intravenously injected nanogels circulated long in the blood compartment and delivered a high concentration of metal ions to the tumor. Separately administered DSF could sequester the metal ions from the nanogels and form highly cytotoxic complexes with potent in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity. This study provides a new strategy to potentiate DSF in anticancer treatment."

"Because of the intense competition, table tennis requires players to bear a strong physiological load, which increases the risk of sports injury. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is an important structure of the knee joint to maintain forward stability and rotational stability and is also a common sports injury in table tennis players. ACL has poor self-repair ability after injury. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide a more comprehensive, reliable, and representative theoretical basis for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of anterior cruciate ligament injury in table tennis players, and three-dimensional reconstruction of ACL using dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) combined with deep learning was conducted. For this purpose, a number of table tennis players with ACL injuries were collected, and each patient underwent arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. DSCT scanning was performed on several knee joints, the 3D model of the knee joint was reconstructed using a CT image postprocessing workstation, and the medial wall of the femoral lateral condyle was reconstructed, as well as the reconstructed single tract of bony canal, tibial plateau, and bony canal. Then, the Lysholm score was used to score the cases, with scores greater than 75 as the excellent group and below 75 as the poor group. The relative positions of the central points of the femoral and tibial canals were marked and measured. The results were as follows: 3D-CT reconstruction could clearly reflect the situation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. In clinic, it is used to evaluate the relationship between bone tunnel location and graft shape so as to guide the surgeon to improve the operation."
"Tumor-selective drug delivery could enhance anticancer efficacy and avoid drug side effects. However, because of tumor heterogeneity, current nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems rarely improve clinical outcomes significantly, commonly only reducing systemic toxicity. In this work, a new tumor-specific, tyrosinase-responsive cascade amplification release nanoparticle (TR-CARN) was developed to fulfill the needs for tumor-specific drug delivery and high efficacy cancer treatment. Tyrosinase (Tyr) is specifically expressed in melanomas and can catalyze acetaminophen (APAP) to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS). It was therefore utilized here to initiate the ROS amplification procedure. In TR-CARN, a ROS-responsive prodrug BDOX was loaded into an amphiphilic polymer, and APAP was linked to the polymer through a ROS-cleavable thioether bond. TR-CARN caused reduced side effects during the delivery because of the low toxicity of BDOX. Once TR-CARN entered into the tumor, endogenous ROS triggered initial APAP and BDOX release. Tyr-mediated ROS synthesis by APAP then accelerated APAP and BDOX release and toxification. Consequently, TR-CARN achieved melanoma-specific treatment of high efficacy through the cascade amplification strategy with enhanced biosafety."
"In this paper, we report on a successful development and application of diazoresin (DR)/β-Cyclodextrin covalently linked capillary coatings using the layer by layer (LBL) self-assembly technique combined with photochemistry reactions. The modified capillary remarkably suppressed the protein adsorption on the inner surface of silica capillary and successfully separated lysozyme (Lys), myoglobin (Mb), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and ribonuclease A (RNase A). Furthermore, the DR/β-Cyclodextrin covalently linked capillary coatings showed good stability and repeatability. More importantly, this method is more environmentally friendly and simpler than traditional methods for the use of DR instead of highly toxic and moisture-sensitive silane coupling agent."
"Carbon-based artificial nanoenzymes have gained increasing interest as emerging and promising nanotheranostic agents due to their biocompatibility, low cost, and straightforward production. Herein, a multifunctional Mn, N, and S incorporated carbon dots (MnNS:CDs) nanoenzyme exhibiting scavenging activity against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), photoluminescence quantum yield of 17.7%, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast was explored. The optical, magnetic, and antioxidant properties of MnNS:CDs were then regulated by control over Mn incorporation to achieve higher photostability and antioxidant properties. Furthermore, conjugation of MnNS:CDs with hyaluronic acid (HA) (denoted as MnNS:CDs@HA) endowed them with high biocompatibility, which is validated by in vivo studies on zebrafish, and the ability to specifically target cluster determinant 44 (CD44)-overexpressing B16F1 cells, as verified by in vitro confocal and MRI studies. The MnNS:CDs@HA probe with therapeutic antioxidant and dual-modal imaging capability was further assessed for non-covalent binding of doxorubicin (DOX) as a model chemotherapeutic cancer drug. Results showed that targeted delivery and pH-dependent release of DOX elicited apparent cell toxicity (90%) toward B16F1 cancer cells when compared to free DOX treatment group (60%). Benefiting from their intrinsic antioxidant properties, and dual-modal imaging ability, the MnNS:CDs@HA nanocarrier is projected to improve non-invasive targeted diagnosis and therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Carbon dots (CDs) have gained increasing interest as emerging and promising artificial functional nanomaterials that mimic the structures and functions of natural enzymes. In this work, Mn, N, and S incorporated CDs (MnNS:CDs) were synthesized using a one-pot microwave hydrothermal method to serve as fluorescent and magnetic resonance imaging probes, and catalase mimics in the reduction of the oxidative-stress related damage. Further conjugation of the probes with hyaluronic acid endows them with a good in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility as well as the capability to selectively target CD44-overexpressing cancer cells, as investigated by in vitro fluorescence, and magnetic resonance imaging. The dual-modal nanoprobe was then used to carry on doxorubicin through a non-covalent association. Favorably, targeted delivery, and pH-responsive release of doxorubicin enhanced cell killing efficiency by 50% as opposed to the free doxorubicin treatment group. The presented theranostic heteroatom doped CDs hold great promise for dual-modal imaging enabling accurate diagnosis coupled with therapeutic effect through free radical scavenging and chemotherapy."

"Nanotechnology has a remarkable impact on the preclinical development of future medicines. However, the complicated preparation and systemic toxicity to living systems prevent them from translation to clinical applications. In the present report, we developed a polyepicatechin-based on/off switchable ultra-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visible theranostic nanoparticle (PEMN) for image-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) using our strategy of integrating polymerization and biomineralization into the protein template. We have exploited natural polyphenols as the near infra-red (NIR) switchable photothermal source and MnO2 for the MRI-guided theranostics. PEMN demonstrates excellent MRI contrast ability with a longitudinal relaxivity value up to 30.01 mM-1 s-1. PEMN has shown great tumor inhibition on orthotopic breast tumors and the treatment could be made switchable with an on/off interchangeable mode as needed. PEMN was found to be excretable mainly through the kidneys, avoiding potential systemic toxicity. Thus, PEMN could be extremely useful for developing on-demand therapeutics via'see it and treat it' means with distinguished MRI capability and on/off switchable photothermal properties."

Herein, we reported active methylene-based polyaddition and polyalkylation catalyzed via an organic superbase under ambient conditions. A model polymerization was first conducted between ethylene glycol diacrylate (EGDA) and methyl cyanoacetate (MCA). The molecular weight (Mw) of the model polymer was up to 50 500 g mol−1 with a high yield (99%). Eight AMCs were selected and a high-throughput parallel synthesizing instrument (HTPSI) was used to synthesize semi-library polymers of AMCs and EGDA via a Michael type polyaddition. The obtained AMC-based polymers had low cell cytotoxicity. Elastomers with cyanogen groups could be prepared using trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) as a crosslinker. Furthermore, three dihalogen compounds were explored to polymerize with MCA and malononitrile via alkylation reactions. The pendent cyanogen or ester groups of the polymers could be reduced by lithium aluminum hydride. Novel polymer families were constructed based on the polyaddition and polyalkylation of AMCs."

"Photothermal therapies (PPTs) with various light-absorbing materials have shown very promising therapeutic effects against cancers. However, their application was severely limited by the lack of accurate localization of tumors and real-time monitoring of the therapeutic process. Theranostic nanoparticles with both imaging and therapeutic functions are highly desired to develop imaging-mediated PPTs. Herein, we develop a facile one-pot method to synthesize a nanoparticle with functions of an MRI contrast agent and a PTT agent through oxidization of dopamine-DTPA-Gd conjugates and PEG-dopamine conjugates. The oxidized dopamine nanoparticles (ODNP) had a high R1 up to 9.6 mM-1 s-1, 2.2 times higher than that of Omniscan, and showed significantly higher MRI contrast enhancement than Omniscan in tumor. Meanwhile, the ODNP showed strong NIR light absorption and significant antitumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo as a PPT agent. The ODNP with excellent MRI contrasting capability and PTT efficacy plus its facile synthesis and good biocompatibility are a very promising theranostic agent for MRI-mediated PTT."

First, an ATRP initiator was immobilized onto the surface of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles, then poly[2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (PDEA) and poly(poly[(ethylene glycol) monomethacrylate]) (PEGMA) were grafted from the surface of the magnetic nanoparticles in succession. Each step of the reactions gave distinctive thermogravimetric analysis curves. Polymer shells cleaved from Fe3O4 core were measured by gel permeation chromatography, while its molecular weight was found to increase with successive polymerization (with a polydispersity of approximately 1.3–1.4). The architecture of the core-shell nanoparticles was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. The Fe3O4@PDEA-PEGMA hybrid magnetic nanoparticles formed stable dispersions in H2O at low pH (pH < 6) and precipitated out at high pH (pH > 6). This pH transition behavior was also observed in dynamic light scattering experiments."

Fluorescent monomer 9-(4-vinylbenzyl)-9H-carbazole (VBK) was synthesized and was grafted from magnetic nanoparticles (ferroferric oxide) via AGET ATRP using FeCl(3)·6H(2)O as the catalyst, tris(3,6-dioxaheptyl)amine (TDA-1) as the ligand, and ascorbic acid (AsAc) as the reducing agent. The initiator for ATRP was modified on magnetic nanoparticles with the reported method: ligand exchange with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and then esterification with 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide. After polymerization, a well-defined nanocomposite (Fe(3)O(4)@PVBK) was yielded with a magnetic core and a fluorescent shell (PVBK). Subsequently, well-dispersed bifunctional nanoparticles (Fe(3)O(4)@PVBK-b-P(PEGMA)) in water were obtained via consecutive AGET ATRP of hydrophilic monomer poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA). The chemical composition of the magnetic nanoparticles' surface at different surface modification stages was investigated with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra. The magnetic and fluorescent properties were validated with a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and a fluorophotometer. The Fe(3)O(4)@PVBK-b-P(PEGMA) nanoparticles showed an effective imaging ability in enhancing the negative contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."

"β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD) and its derivatives have been widely employed in the field of chiral separation, but they are still faced the limitation of low enantioselectivity and complex processes. Derivatization with functional molecules or preparation as bridging dimers are the two main modifications for β-CD to obtain chiral recognition compounds. Herein, a partially derived bridged β-CD (CPI-EBCD) bonded chiral stationary phases was prepared to improve enantioseparation. The chiral recognition moiety was synthesized by a bridged β-cyclodextrin dimer using a short-chain bridging agent (ethylenediamine) and then modifying the bridged cyclodextrin with a 4-chlorophenylisocyanate (CPI) containing a benzene ring and polar group. Compared with natural β-CD, dual-chambered CPI-EBCDs have better encapsulation synergies and more recognition sites with the guest molecule, while the short flexible bridging groups make the double cavities closer and more easily recognizable as linear molecules. The introduction of derived groups CPI provided more recognition sites and more types of interactions, including π-π interaction force, hydrogen bonding effect, and dipole-dipole interaction, thus improving the enantiomer-specific chirality recognition effect. The chiral stationary phase CPI-EBCDP was obtained by connecting CPI-EDCB with mesoporous silica microspheres by simple photochemical reaction using a green non-toxic diazo resin as coupling agent, simplifying preparation process. In the reversed phase mode of liquid chromatography, CPI-EBCDP has excellent chiral recognition ability, and 12 chiral compounds are successfully isolated by optimizing mobile phase conditions, with good reproducibility and stability. The successful preparation of this new chiral stationary phase provides an important reference for the subsequent development of cyclodextrin-like chiral stationary phases."

"l metastasis (PM) is considered one of the most dreaded forms of cancer metastases for both patients and physicians. Aggressive cytoreductive surgery (CRS) is the primary treatment for peritoneal metastasis. Unfortunately, this intensive treatment frequently causes clinical complications, such as postoperative recurrence, metastasis, and adhesion formation. Emerging evidence suggest that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released by inflammatory neutrophils contribute to these complications. Effective NET-targeting strategies thus show considerable potential in counteracting these complications but remain challenging. Here, we synthesized and screened one type of sulfoxide-containing homopolymer, PMeSEA, with potent fouling-resistant and NET-inhibiting capabilities. Hydrating sulfoxide groups endow PMeSEA with superior non-fouling ability, significantly inhibiting protein/cell adhesion. Besides, the polysulfoxides can be selectively oxidized by ClO- which is required to stabilize the NETs rather than H2O2, and ClO- scavenging effectively inhibits NETs formation without disturbing redox homeostasis in tumor cells and quiescent neutrophils. As a result, PMeSEA potently prevents postoperative adhesions, significantly suppresses peritoneal metastasis, and shows synergetic antitumor activity with chemotherapeutic 5-Fluorouracil. Moreover, coupling aggressive cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with PMeSEA potently inhibits CRS-induced tumor metastatic relapse and postoperative adhesions. Notably, PMeSEA exhibits low in vivo acute and subacute toxicities, implying significant potential for clinical postoperative adjuvant treatment. This article is protected by copyright.

"Combination chemotherapy is a common strategy to enhance treatment efficacy and avoid multidrug resistance (MDR) in clinical practice. However, it is difficult to ensure the co-enrichment and reasonable ratio of synergistic drugs in the lesion site after intravenous administration. Integrating synergistic drugs into a nanocarrier can improve drug stability, targeting, drug loading, and importantly, ensure that synergistic drugs work at one destination. This study uses 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) to construct a polymeric prodrug micelle, and the demethylcantharidin (DMC) is proportionally encapsulated within the micelle. Triggered by reactive oxygen species (ROS), HCPT and DMC were released simultaneously from the co-delivery platform in tumor cells. DMC promotes abnormal cell division by inhibiting the synthesis of the cell cycle checkpoint kinase Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), leading to increased cell vulnerability to DNA damage, disordered replication, and death. The co-delivery platform exhibited satisfactory biosafety and antitumor efficacy in vivo. The proposed co-delivery platform may provide a valuable reference for the translation of clinical combination chemotherapy regimens into nano-drug delivery systems."
"Liver fibrosis is the critical stage in the development of chronic liver disease (CLD), from simple injury to irreversible cirrhosis. Timely detection and intervention of liver fibrosis are crucial for preventing CLD from progressing into a fatal condition. Herein, we developed iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (IONPs) and ferulic acid (FA) coencapsulated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs), followed by surface modification with cRGD peptides (cRGD-PLGA/IOFA) for integrin-targeted clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-traceable treatment of liver fibrosis. The cRGD peptide linked on the surface of the PLGA/IOFA NPs could specifically bind to the overexpressed integrin αvβ3 on activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in the fibrotic liver, enabling the high-sensitive clinical MR imaging (3 T) and precise staging of liver fibrosis. The FA encapsulated in cRGD-PLGA/IOFA showed excellent efficacy in reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting the activation of HSCs through the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad pathway. Notably, the IONPs encapsulated in cRGD-PLGA/IOFA NPs could alleviate liver fibrosis by regulating hepatic macrophages through the NF-κB pathway, lowering the proportion of Ly6Chigh/CD86+, and degrading collagen fibers. The FA and IONPs in the cRGD-PLGA/IOFA produced a synergistic enhancement effect on collagen degradation, which was more effective than the IONPs treatment alone. This study demonstrates that cRGD-PLGA/IOFA NPs could effectively relieve liver fibrosis by acting on macrophages and HSCs and provide a new strategy for the clinical MRI-traceable treatment of liver fibrosis."
"Organic small molecule fluorescent groups have injected new material support into the field of medical imaging due to their unique luminescence mechanism and easy tuning of structure. The great potential of NIR-II window imaging forces us to continuously optimize the structure of organic fluorophores to design better fluorescent molecules for fluorescence imaging-guided surgery. An ideal organic small molecule fluorescent group: it can penetrate into the inside of the organism, clearly present the internal structure and the edge contour of different tissues, so as to perfectly achieve internal imaging and accurately guide external surgery. In vivo, fluorescent groups do not damage normal tissues and organs. However, problems such as low quantum yield and poor biocompatibility greatly limit the clinical transformation of NIR-II fluorescent small molecules. To avoid the shortcomings of NIR-II fluorescent probes as much as possible and better realize image-guided surgery, in this experiment, the biplane donor unit was incorporated into the twisted D-π-A-π-D structure to expand the conjugated structure of the fluorescent group, which not only realized NIR-II emission, but also had high quantum yield and biosafety."
"Effective accumulation and penetration of antibiotics in the biofilm are critical issues for bacterial infection treatment. Red blood cells (RBCs) have been widely utilized to hitchhike nanocarriers for drug delivery. It is vital and challenging to find a nanocarrier with an appropriate affinity toward RBCs and bacteria for selective hitchhiking and release that determines the drug delivery efficiency and specificity. Herein, we report a zwitterionic polymer poly(2-(N-oxide-N,N-diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (OPDEA)-based micelle, which can hitchhike on RBCs in blood and preferentially release in the infection site. We found that OPDEA could bind to the RBCs cell membrane via phospholipid-related affinity and transfer to Gram-positive bacteria due to nearly an order of magnitude stronger interaction with the bacteria cell wall. The zwitterionic surface and cell-wall affinity of OPDEA-based micelles also promote their penetration in biofilm. The clarithromycin-loaded OPDEA micelles show efficient drug delivery into the infection site, resulting in excellent therapeutic performance in both peritonitis and pneumonia models by intravenous or spray administration. This simple RBC-selective hitchhiking and releasing antibiotic delivery system provides a promising strategy for the design of antibacterial nanomedicines."

"Poly-l-lysine (PLL) dendrimers have emerged as promising nanomaterials for gene/drug delivery, bioimaging, and biosensing due to their high efficacy and biocompatibility. In our previous works, we successfully synthesized two categories of PLL dendrimers with two different cores: the planar-shaped perylenediimide and the cubic-shaped polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes. However, the effect of these two topologies on the PLL dendrimer structures is not clearly understood. In this work, we carried out in-depth investigations on the influence of core topologies on the PLL dendrimer structures using molecular dynamics simulations. We show that, even at high generations, the core topology affects the shape and branch distribution of the PLL dendrimer, which may further determine their performance. Moreover, our findings suggest that the core topology on the PLL dendrimer structures can be further designed and improved to fully exploit and utilize their potential in biomedical applications."

"ared (NIR) emission materials can be widely applied in various fields, such as food detection, imaging, treatment, electronic products. With the trend of miniaturization of equipment, smaller materials are needed. In this work, we successfully synthesized a series of M2Ga2GeO7:N3+ (M = Ca, Ba, Sr; N = Cr, Nd, Er) samples and then focused on the study of Nd3+ doped Sr2Ga2GeO7 (SGGO). A series of SGGO:xNd3+ sub-micron phosphors were prepared via a microwave-assisted sol–gel process combined with subsequent calcination at 750 ℃, and the structural information and luminescent properties were systematically studied. SGGO is a representative tetragonal crystal and belonging to the space group of P 4¯ 21m (113). The Nd3+ ions occupy eight-coordinated Sr2+ sites in the crystal lattice. From SEM analysis, the average particle size distribution is 219.7 ± 41.4 nm. The sub-micron phosphors have rich excitation spectra ranging from 350 nm to 850 nm and can produce multiband NIR emissions of 1331, 1056, and 905 nm when excited by ultraviolet and NIR light. The maximum emission intensity was obtained by optimizing the doping ratio of Nd3+ ions. A commercial chip was then utilized to fabricate light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to verify its application potential in NIR-II mini-LEDs. Compared with blue light LEDs, the as-prepared LEDs had good imaging penetration depth and could be clearly observed under 10 mm of chicken breast coverage. The maximum imaging penetration depth can be 33 mm."
"Small organic photothermal agents (PTAs) with absorption bands located in the second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) window are highly desirable for effectively combating deep-seated tumors. However, the rarely reported NIR-II absorbing PTAs still suffer from a low molar extinction coefficient (MEC, ϵ), inadequate chemostability and photostability, as well as the high light power density required during the therapeutic process. Herein, we developed a series of boron difluoride bridged azafulvene dimer acceptor-integrated small organic PTAs. The B-N coordination bonds in the π-conjugated azafulvene dimer backbone endow it the strong electron-withdrawing ability, facilitating the vigorous donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) structure PTAs with NIR-II absorption. Notably, the PTA namely OTTBF shows high MEC (7.21×104 M-1 cm-1), ultrahigh chemo- and photo-stability. After encapsulated into water-dispersible nanoparticles, OTTBF NPs can achieve remarkable photothermal conversion effect under 1064 nm irradiation with a light density as low as 0.7 W cm-2, which is the lowest reported NIR-II light power used in PTT process as we know. Furthermore, OTTBF NPs have been successfully applied for in vitro and in vivo deep-seated cancer treatments under 1064 nm laser. This study provides an insight into the future exploration of versatile D-A-D structured NIR-II absorption organic PTAs for biomedical applications."

"Post-cleavable block copolymer is a very important class of materials, especially for the preparation of nanochannel materials. Block copolymers can self-assemble to various nanostructures. By adding specific groups between two blocks, we can obtain the materials we need. Here, we synthesized a block copolymer with acid-cleavable junction. Polyethylene oxide and polymethyl methacrylate with chalcone structure （PEO-Ac-PChal）were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). After the acetal structure is acidified, one of the blocks was dissolved by a specific solvent, and the nanochannel structure was prepared."
"We reported a new method for preparing coated capillaries in this paper. First, we combined hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and 2-Methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) to form hydroxypropyl cellulose-poly (2-Methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (HPC-PMPC) by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Then the photosensitive polymer diazoresin (DR) was used as a linker to the inner wall of the capillary, and finally exposed to ultraviolet light to form a stable covalent bond coating. Protein adsorption on the inner surface of capillary was effectively inhibited. The cytochrome c (Cyt-c), lysozyme (Lys), ribonuclease A (RNase A) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were separated obviously using capillary electrophoresis (CE) within 15 minutes and showed good stability and repeatability."
"Whilst the senses of vision and hearing have been successfully automated and miniaturized in portable formats (e.g. smart phone), this is yet to be achieved with the sense of smell. This is because the sensing challenge is not trivial as it involves navigating a chemosensory space comprising thousands of volatile organic compounds. Distinct aroma recognition is based on detecting unique combinations of volatile organic compounds. In natural olfactory systems this is accomplished by employing odorant receptors (ORs) with varying specificities, together with combinatorial neural coding mechanisms. Attempts to mimic the remarkable sensitivity and accuracy of natural olfactory systems has therefore been challenging. Current portable chemical sensors for odorant detection are neither sensitive nor selective, prompting research exploring artificial olfactory devices that use natural OR proteins for sensing. Much research activity to develop OR based biosensors has concentrated on mammalian ORs, however, insect ORs have not been explored as extensively. Insects possess an extraordinary sense of smell due to a repertoire of odorant receptors evolved to interpret olfactory cues vital to the insects' survival. The potential of insect ORs as sensing elements is only now being unlocked through recent research efforts to understand their structure, ligand binding mechanisms and development of odorant biosensors. Like their mammalian counterparts, there are many challenges with working with insect ORs. These include expression, purification and presentation of the insect OR in a stable display format compatible with an effective transduction methodology while maintaining OR structure and function. Despite these challenges, significant progress has been demonstrated in developing OR-based biosensors which exploit insect ORs in cells, lipid bilayers, liposomes and nanodisc formats. Ultrasensitive and highly selective detection of volatile organic compounds has been validated by coupling these insect OR display formats with transduction methodologies spanning optical (fluorescence) and electrical (field effect transistors, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) techniques. This review summarizes the current status of insect OR based biosensors and their future outlook."

"sfer radical polymerization (ATRP), a transition metal-mediated living radical polymerization, has been developed as a powerful tool for synthesizing polymers of controlled structure, but its catalyst residue remains challenging. Described in this thesis is a cOI?prehensive study on the A TRP applications in macromonomer preparation and the solutions to its catalyst residue problem by catalyst supporting. A novel continuous process for the production of polymers and block copolymers with controlled molecular weights has also been developed using packed column reactor technologies. New versatile vinyl-containing initiators, 2'-vinyloxyethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate (VBIB) and 3'-vinyloxylpropyl trichloroacetamide (VTCA), were screened for the macromonomer synthesis of different vinyl monomer types by ATRP. Polymethacrylate and polystyrene macromonomers of well-controlled molecular weights were obtained without consumption of the initiators' vinyl moieties at monomer conversions lower than 80%. However, the ATRP of acrylates started to consume the vinyl moieties at medium conversions. Therefore, the polymerization of acrylates must be terminated at an early stage in order to obtain their macromonomers. Three catalyst supporting systems have been developed to solve the catalyst contamination problem for batch ATRP. Firstly, the CuBrlHMTETA complex was supported onto silica gel by physical adsorption for ATRP of MMA in toluene. The supported complex mediated a living polymerization of MMA. The recycled catalysts had a high retention of catalyst activity and improved control over the polymer molecular"

"Gene therapy is the most effective treatment option for diseases, but its effectiveness is affected by the choice and design of gene carriers. The genes themselves have to pass through multiple barriers in order to enter the cell and therefore require additional vectors to carry them inside the cell. In gene therapy, peptides have unique properties and potential as gene carriers, which can effectively deliver genes into specific cells or tissues, protect genes from degradation, improve gene transfection efficiency, and enhance gene targeting and biological responsiveness. This paper reviews the research progress of peptides and their derivatives in the field of gene delivery recently, describes the obstacles encountered by foreign materials to enter the interior of the cell, and introduces the following classes of functional peptides that can carry materials into the interior of the cell, and assist in transmembrane translocation of carriers, thus breaking through endosomal traps to enable successful entry of genetic materials into the nucleus of the cell. The paper also discusses the combined application of peptide vectors with other vectors to enhance its transfection ability, explores current challenges encountered by peptide vectors, and looks forward to future developments in the field."
"Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) is an excellent photosensitizer and photothermal agent with the advantages of good planarity, strong electron affinity, high electron mobility, easy purification, easy structural modification and high molar absorption coefficient. It is regarded as one of the ideal choices for the design and synthesis of efficient organic photovoltaic materials. Therefore, two kinds of donor-acceptor (D-A) conjugated polymers were designed and synthesized with DPP as the acceptor, and their optical properties and applications in the near-infrared region were studied. The quantum yield (QY) of PBDT-DPP is 0.46%, and the highest temperature reached within 10 minutes after irradiation with a 660 nm laser is 60 °C. Another polymer, EDOT-DPP, has a QY of 0.48%, and its semiconductor polymer nanoparticle aqueous solution can reach 60 °C within 12 minutes under laser irradiation, achieving photothermal treatment of nude mice tumors. Both polymer NPs have good biocompatibility and promising applications in bioimaging and photothermal therapy."
"Near-infrared second region (NIR-II) fluorescent probes are used in the diagnosis of early cancer due to their high tissue penetration. However, there are still few reports on organic small molecule fluorescent probes with NIR-II fluorescence imaging (NIR-II FI) combined with efficient photothermal therapy (PTT). In this study, planar cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) was incorporated into the twisted structural skeleton (D-A-D), and the strong acceptor TTQ molecule (A) and the donor triphenylamine (D) were introduced to synthesize an organic small molecule (TCT) with enhanced NIR-II fluorescence emission performance. To improve the hydrophilicity of TCT molecules, we used the nanoprecipitation method to coat DSPE-mPEG2000 on the TCT molecules and obtained nanoparticles (TCT-NPs) with a strong absorption band, good water dispersibility, and NIR-II FI ability, which realized NIR-II FI-guided PTT for breast cancer tumors. Due to their effective near-infrared absorption, TCT-NPs exhibit high photothermal conversion efficiency (η = 40.1%) under 660 nm laser irradiation, making them a photothermal therapeutic agent with good performance. Therefore, TCT-NPs have the potential to diagnose, eliminate, and monitor the diffusion of cancer."
"In this review, microspheres for ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) were reviewed in accordance with the literature in recent years.

"Bleeding from uncontrollable wounds can be fatal, and the body's clotting mechanisms are unable to control bleeding in a timely and effective manner in emergencies such as battlefields and traffic accidents. For irregular and inaccessible wounds, hemostatic materials are needed to intervene to stop bleeding. Hemostatic microspheres are promising for hemostasis, as their unique structural features can promote coagulation. There is a wide choice of materials for the preparation of microspheres, and the modification of natural macromolecular materials such as chitosan to enhance the hemostatic properties and make up for the deficiencies of synthetic macromolecular materials makes the hemostatic microspheres multifunctional and expands the application fields of hemostatic microspheres. Here, we focus on the hemostatic mechanism of different materials and the preparation methods of microspheres, and introduce the modification methods, related properties and applications (in cancer therapy) for the structural characteristics of hemostatic microspheres. Finally, we discuss the future trends of hemostatic microspheres and research opportunities for developing the next generation of hemostatic microsphere materials."

"Transmission through the respiratory tract is one of the most important ways for bacteria and viruses to infect the human body; the use of high-performance antibacterial and antiviral protective equipment is the most effective way to prevent the spread of respiratory diseases. However, at present, most personal protective equipment lacks the ability to kill pathogens. In this paper, a kind of polytetrahydropyrimidine-polyethylene terephthalate functional fiber (PET-PTHP fibers) with highly sustained antibacterial and antiviral properties was prepared. The inactivation rate of the fibers against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was as high as 99.99%, and the antibacterial time was more than 72 h. The fibers have an obvious destructive effect on lentiviruses and can reduce the infection rate of lentiviruses in BxPC-3 cells from 25.4 to 9.7%. The cytotoxicity test, cell live/dead staining test, and cell proliferation test all confirmed that PET-PTHP fibers have no obvious cytotoxicity and good cytocompatibility. By applying the functional fibers to the inner layer of the masks, a new type of mask with adsorption, filtration, and killing properties against pathogens was prepared. The filtration efficiency of the new masks was 99.3%, and the pressure drop was 104 Pa. The new masks have excellent air permeability and filtration effect, meet the practical application conditions, and are of grade A; therefore, these masks provide medical protection as well as kill pathogens at the same time, further reducing the risk of human infection."
"Immunotherapy has emerged as a triumph in the treatment of malignant cancers. Nevertheless, current immunotherapeutics are insufficient in addressing tumors characterized by tumor cells' inadequate antigenicity and the tumor microenvironment's low immunogenicity (TME). Herein, we developed a novel multifunctional nanoassembly termed FMMC through the self-assembly of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1) inhibitor 1-methyl-tryptophan prodrug (FM), Ce6, and ionic manganese (Mn2+) via noncovalent interactions. The laser-ignited FMMC treatment could induce effective immunogenic cell death and activate the STING/MHC-I signaling pathway, thus deeply sculpting the tumor-intrinsic antigenicity to achieve dendritic cell (DC)-dependent and -independent T cell responses against tumors. Meanwhile, by inhibiting IDO-1, FMMC could lead to immunosuppressive TME reversion to an immunoactivated one. FMMC-based phototherapy led to the up-regulation of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), enhancing the sensitivity of tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy. Furthermore, the incorporation of Mn2+ into FMMC resulted in an augmented longitudinal relaxivity and enhanced the MRI for monitoring the growth of primary tumors and lung metastases. Collectively, the superior reprogramming performance of immunosuppressive tumor cells and TME, combined with excellent anticancer efficacy and MRI capability, made FMMC a promising immune nanosculptor for cancer theranostics."

"Herein, we report a class of distinctive supramolecular nanostructures in situ-generated from the cationic ring-opening polymerization of a particular 2-oxazoline monomer, i.e., 2-(N-tert-butyloxycarbonylaminomethyl)-2-oxazoline (Ox1). Driven by side-chain hydrogen bonding between neighboring molecules and van der Waals interactions, the growing oligomers of Ox1 precipitate in the form of macroscopic platelets when the degree of polymerization reaches 5-7. A similar self-assembly occurred in the block copolymerization of 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline (EtOx) or 2-pentyl-2-oxazoline (PeOx) and Ox1 as the second monomer. These polymeric aggregates were found to disassemble into rod-like nanoparticles under appropriate conditions, and to form stable organogels in some polar solvents like dimethylformamide as well as in natural liquid fragrances such as (R)-carvone, citronellal, and (R)-limonene. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the morphology of their xerogels was solvent-dependent, mainly with a lamellar or fibrous structure. The rheology measurements confirmed the as-obtained organogels feature an obvious thixotropic character. The storage modulus was about 7-10 times higher than the loss modulus, indicating the physical crosslinking in the gel. The fragrance release profiles showed that the presented supramolecular gel system exhibits good sustained-release effect for the loaded bioactive volatiles."

Furthermore, we found that ICC membranes containing Hydroxyethyl methacrylate have significantly improved lysozyme adsorption than ICC membranes without Hydroxyethyl methacrylate. With the increasing lysozyme concentration, the ICC membrane containing 50% HEMA showed an excellent selective adsorption effect. At the same time, we describe the adsorption mechanism of lysozyme on the ICC membrane containing HEMA.

"We demonstrate the successful preparation of stable liquid marbles from various liquids. This is accomplished by using low-surface-energy poly[2-(perfluorooctyl)ethyl acrylate] (PFA-C(8)) as microparticles. The PFA-C(8) microparticles were prepared by the spontaneous self-organized microparticulation of PFA-C(8). The physical properties remained intact in the polymer morphology as confirmed by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. The extremely low surface energy of PFA-C(8) provides a high solid-liquid spreading coefficient (S(S/L)) value for various combinations of liquids. As a result, liquid marbles were obtained from various liquids, unlike the case with other fluorine polymer particles such as poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) and poly(vinilydene fluoride) (PVDF). These results suggest that the technique is widely applicable for preparing novel functional materials."

"Various delivery vectors have been integrated within biologically derived membrane systems to extend their residential time and reduce their reticuloendothelial system (RES) clearance during systemic circulation. However, rational design is still needed to further improve the in situ penetration efficiency of chemo-drug-loaded membrane delivery-system formulations and their release profiles at the tumor site. Here, a macrophage-membrane-coated nanoparticle is developed for tumor-targeted chemotherapy delivery with a controlled release profile in response to tumor microenvironment stimuli. Upon fulfilling its mission of tumor homing and RES evasion, the macrophage-membrane coating can be shed via morphological changes driven by extracellular microenvironment stimuli. The nanoparticles discharged from the outer membrane coating show penetration efficiency enhanced by their size advantage and surface modifications. After internalization by the tumor cells, the loaded drug is quickly released from the nanoparticles in response to the endosome pH. The designed macrophage-membrane-coated nanoparticle (cskc-PPiP/PTX@Ma) exhibits an enhanced therapeutic effect inherited from both membrane-derived tumor homing and step-by-step controlled drug release. Thus, the combination of a biomimetic cell membrane and a cascade-responsive polymeric nanoparticle embodies an effective drug delivery system tailored to the tumor microenvironment."

The Fe3O4@SiO2@Chitosan composite was stable and easily recovered, which demonstrated that the Fe3O4@SiO2@Chitosan can be successfully used as a reusable absorbent for effective removal of methyl orange from wastewater."

"Hollow mesoporous silica and carbon quantum dots play an important role in the field of biological applications. In this study, a nano-scale hollow mesoporous silica nanosphere (HMSN) was used as the main body of a drug transport system, which filled with a small amount of carbon quantum dots. The hollow mesoporous silica structure provides a large specific surface area and cavity structure for efficient drug loading. And the carbon quantum dots could provide good fluorescence for imaging. By filling carbon quantum dots inside of silica nanospheres and in mesopores on the surface, the hollow mesoporous silica nanospheres became fluorescent and could be used as a fluorescent probe. And the potential photothermal effect of the internal carbon quantum dots also makes it possible to achieve controlled drug release through temperature changes."
"The ability to manipulate and control the inner surface properties of silica capillary is of crucial importance for analysis of proteins by capillary electrophoresis. In this work, surface-initiated atom transfers radical polymerization (ATRP) of zwitterionic 3-dimethyl(methacryloyloxyethyl) ammonium propane sulfonate (DMAPS) is employed to tailor the functionality of silica capillary in a well-controlled manner. The structure of the coating and the protein separation performance were investigated. The results confirmed that the P(DMAPS) grafting can substantially enhance the performance of the capillary columns. With the versatility of surface-initiated ATRP and the excellent performance of zwitterionic polymer chains, the zwitterionic polymer coated capillary columns can be readily tailored for analysis of proteins by capillary electrophoresis."

"Thermoresponsive polymers have many biomedical applications, but their nondegradability limits their in vivo applications. Herein, we report a new type of degradable thermoresponsive polymers-degradable poly (ethylene glycol) analogues (DPEGs) having lower critical solution temperatures (LCSTs) ranging 10-50 degrees C. DPEGs were synthesized by condensation polymerization of PEG-di(meth)acrylates (PEGDA or PEGDMA) with dithiols. Their LCSTs could be easily tuned by the PEG-chain length and the types of the double bond in the PEG monomers and dithiols. Long PEG chain and the presence of hydrophilic groups in the dithiol monomer increased the LCST of the resulting DPEG. Crosslinking DPEG chains produced thermoresponsive hydrogels. The hydrogels prepared by the end-capping method maintained the thermoresponsive properties of the linear DPEG. The degradable thermoresponsive DPEGs and their hydrogels have great potentials for in vivo biomedical applications."
"Targeted delivery of vitamins to a desirable area is an active branch in a modern pharmacology. The most important and difficult delivery of vitamin B12 is that to bone marrow and nerve cells. Herein we present a first step towards the development of two types of smart carriers, polymer capsules and lyotropic liquid-crystalline nanosystems, for vitamin B12 targeted delivery and induced release. A vitamin B12 encapsulation technique into nanoengineered polymeric capsules produced by layer-by-layer assembling of polymeric shells on CaCO3 templates has been developed. The effectiveness of the process was demonstrated by optical absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and small-angle X-ray diffraction. TEM and AFM analyses performed on capsules after their drying, confirmed the presence of the vitamin B12 inside the capsules in the form of crystalline nanoaggregates, 50-300 nm in diameter. Soft lipid nanovectors consisting of amphiphilic phytantriol molecules, which in water excess spontaneously self-assembly in 3D well-ordered inverse bicontinuous cubic bulk phase, were used as alternative carriers for vitamin B12. It was shown that about 30% of the vitamin added in the preparation of the soft lipid system was actually encapsulated in cubosomes and that no structural changes occurred upon loading. The Vitamin stabilizes the lipid system playing the role of its structure-forming element. The biocompatible nature, the stability and the feasibility of these systems make them good candidates as carriers for hydrophilic vitamins."

"Although nanoparticle-based chemotherapeutic strategies have gained in popularity, the efficacy of such therapies is still limited in part due to the different nanoparticle sizes needed to best accommodate different parts of the drug delivery pathway. Herein, we describe a nanogel-based nanoassembly based on the entrapment of ultrasmall starch nanoparticles (size 10-40 nm) within disulfide-crosslinked chondroitin sulfate-based nanogels (size 150-250 nm) to address this challenge. Upon exposure of the nanoassembly to the reductive tumor microenvironment, the chondroitin sulfate-based nanogel can degrade to release the doxorubicin-loaded starch nanoparticles in the tumor to facilitate improved intratumoral penetration. CT26 colon carcinoma spheroids could be efficiently penetrated by the nanoassembly (resulting in 1 order of magnitude higher DOX-derived fluorescence inside the spheroid relative to free DOX), while in vivo experiments showed that doxorubicin-loaded nanoassemblies reduced tumor sizes by 6× relative to saline controls and 2× relative to free DOX after 21 days. Together, these data suggest that nanogel-based nanoassemblies are a viable option for improving the efficacy and safety of nanoparticle-based drug delivery vehicles treating cancer."
"The major obstacle facing efficient gene therapy is the development of reliable delivery vehicles, which are both nontoxic and biocompatible and possess efficient cell-specific gene delivery. Previously, hybrid delivery vehicles comprising anionic liposomes and cationic polymers have been used successfully for gene therapy. In this study, hybrid vectors based on glycosylated artificial viral envelopes (including two novel compositions mimicking HIV and HSV envelopes) and polyethylenimine were morphologically and physiologically characterised. Transfection studies showed that the hybrid vectors based on the control liposomes, and their glycosylated modifications, had significantly higher transfection rates compared to the polyplexes. Improvement in the transfection efficiency was observed with the glycosylated HIV- and HSV-mimicking hybrid vectors, which also showed a safe biocompatibility profile based on the cytotoxicity and haemocompatibility assays. These glycosylated artificial viral envelope-based hybrid vectors could be used as safe gene delivery systems with potential to become new compositions for efficient nonviral gene therapy."
"Three different types of polymer ligands, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(methyl methacrylate-random-poly(ethylene glycol)methyl ether methacrylate) (PMMA-r-PEGMEMA), and poly(ionic liquid)s (PIL), were grafted onto the surface of 15 nm solid and large hollow porous silica nanoparticles (average particle size ∼60 nm) by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) to demonstrate the enhanced carbon dioxide (CO2) permeability as well as mechanical properties. After characterizing the purified products, free-standing bulk films were fabricated by the solvent-casting method. The poly(ionic liquid) nanocomposite films exhibited a much higher carbon dioxide permeance than PMMA and PMMA-r-PEGMEMA systems with a similar silica content. Also, the hollow silica-mixed matrix membranes showed a significant enhancement in CO2 permeability compared to the 15 nm solid silica films because of the pore structure. Despite the transparency loss due to the scattering of larger particle sizes, the hollow silica particle brush films exhibited the same mechanical properties as the 15 nm solid silica-derived ones."

"Four monodisperse porous polymer microspheres were successfully prepared by seed emulsion polymerization and used as stationary phases for HPLC and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (Prep-HPLC). All four polymer microspheres(polystyrene-polystyrene (PS-PS), polystyrene-poly(glycidyl methylate) (PS-PGMA), polystyrene-poly(methyl methylate) and poly(glycidyl methylate)-poly(glycidyl methylate) were used for filling HPLC empty columns. According to the analysis results of the HPLC column, PS-PS and PS-PGMA microspheres were screened out as the stationary phase of Prep-HPLC. The industrial-grade phytol was successfully separated and purified, and the purity of the final phytol was as high as 99%. The two types of polymer microspheres have been applied to industrial-grade phytol purification and have been used in factories."
"ork, a two‐step activated swelling technique was effectively employed to successfully synthesize monodisperse porous poly(styrene‐divinylbenzene) (PS‐DVB) particles. Diazoresin (DR) transform an ionic bond into a covalent bond by photoreaction. Under ultraviolet irradiation, DR was used to covalently attach dichlorophenyl isocyanate to sulfonated PS‐DVB microspheres. The novel photo‐crosslinking reaction effectively overcomes the toxicity issues associated with conventional coupling agents and enables green production of chromatographic fillers. Modified PS‐DVB particles were indeed commonly used as filler material for the separation of chiral compounds by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The porous modified microspheres designed effectively separate benzoone, DL‐mandelic acid, 2‐phenylcyclohexanone, ibuprofen, 2‐hydroxyl flavone, DL‐cysteine, chloraniline maleate, hesperidin, and other chiral compounds by 100 mm column. It is noteworthy that the isocyanate‐chitin modified microspheres are effective in separating chiral drugs (1000 μg/mL) within 5 min. Compared with ordinary microspheres, porous isocyanate‐chitin modified microspheres showed better separation efficiency under the same conditions. The enhancement is attributed to the increase in their specific surface area. Consequently, they are a better choice of chromatographic packing matrix."
"anscytosis‐mediated nanomedicine transport presents considerable potential in overcoming diverse delivery barriers, thereby facilitating tumor accumulation and penetration. Nevertheless, the persistent challenge lies in achieving a nuanced equilibrium between intracellular interception for drug release and transcytosis for tumor penetration. In this study, a comprehensive exploration is conducted involving a series of polyglutamine‐paclitaxel conjugates featuring distinct hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratios (HHR) and tertiary amine‐oxide proportions (TP) (OPGA‐PTX). The screening process, meticulously focused on delineating their subcellular distribution, transcytosis capability, and tumor penetration, unveils a particularly promising candidate denoted as OPPX, characterized by an HHR of 10:1 and a TP of 100%. OPPX, distinguished by its rapid cellular internalization through multiple endocytic pathways, selectively engages in trafficking to the Golgi apparatus for transcytosis to facilitate accumulation within and penetration throughout tumor tissues and simultaneously sorted to lysosomes for cathepsin B‐activated drug release. This study not only identifies OPPX as an exemplary nanomedicine but also underscores the feasibility of modulating subcellular distribution to optimize the active transport capabilities and intracellular release mechanisms of nanomedicines, providing an alternative approach to designing efficient anticancer nanomedicines."

"Peritoneal metastasis is very common in gastrointestinal, reproductive, and genitourinary tract cancers in late stages or postsurgery, causing poor prognosis, so effective and nontoxic prophylactic strategies against peritoneal metastasis are highly imperative. Herein, we demonstrate the first gene transfection as a nontoxic prophylaxis preventing peritoneal metastasis or operative metastatic dissemination. Lipopolyplexes of TNF-related-apoptosis-inducing-ligand (TRAIL) transfected peritonea and macrophages to express TRAIL for over 15 days. The expressed TRAIL selectively induced tumor cell apoptosis while exempting normal tissue, providing long-term tumor surveillance. Therefore, tumor cells inoculated in the pretransfected peritoneal cavity quickly underwent apoptosis and, thus, barely formed tumor nodules, significantly prolonging the mouse survival time compared with chemotherapy prophylaxis. Furthermore, lipopolyplex transfection showed no sign of toxicity. Therefore, this peritoneal TRAIL-transfection is an effective and safe prophylaxis, preventing peritoneal metastasis."
"Cancer nanomedicines require different, even opposite, properties to voyage the cascade drug delivery process involving a series of biological barriers. Currently-approved nanomedicines can only alleviate adverse effects but cannot improve patient survival because they fail to meet all the requirements. Therefore, nanocarriers with synchronized functions are highly requisite to capacitate efficient drug delivery and enhanced therapeutic efficacies. This perspective article summarizes recent advances in the two main strategies for nanomedicine design, the All-in-One approach (integration of all the functions in one system) and the One-for-All approach (one functional group with proper affinity enables all the functions), and presents our views on future nanomedicine development."

"A novel chiral selector polyacrylic acid-β-cyclodextrin (PAA-β-CD) was successfully prepared, then a facile synthesis of PAA-β-CD stationary phase based on diazotized silica was developed and characterized. Monodisperse silica microspheres were synthesized by a modified Stöber method. The obtained silica particles were functionalized by self-assembly positive charged photosensitive diazoresin (DR) and PAA-β-CD on the surface. The corresponding chiral stationary phase (CSP) was used in HPLC and the enantioseparation performance was investigated in both polar organic and reverse phase mode. Better separation abilities and excellent enantio-selectivities were obtained on PAA-β-CD CSP for antihistamine drugs in the acetonitrile and triethylammonium acetate buffer mobile phase.

"An ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was developed based on MIL-53(Al)@CdS QDs and SiO2@AuNPs for trichlorfon detection. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were used as a loading platform that provided a large surface area to load targets and modified materials onto the electrode. At the same time, SiO2@AuNPs loaded plenty of AuNPs which effectively increased the ECL resonance energy transfer between the CdS QDs, so that the ECL signal was strongly quenched and resulted in an amplified response. In the range of 10-11-10-4 M, the ECL response showed a linear relationship with the concentration (logarithm) of trichlorfon, and the detection limit was 5.1 × 10-12 M (S/N = 3). When the biosensor was applied to detect trichlorfon in lettuce, broccoli, cucumber, and chives, the recoveries obtained from the spiked samples were 97%-105%, 102%-104%, 100%-104%, and 98%-104%, respectively. Thus, this novel ECL biosensor has potential applications for the analysis of trichlorfon in food samples."

"In this paper, the adsorption of copper ions on the prepared multilayer diazo resin-graphene oxide/polyacrylonitrile composite membranes was studied, and the adsorption capacity of GO modified polyacrylonitrile membranes to copper ions under different conditions was explored. The concentration of copper ion solution before and after adsorption was measured by inductively coupled plasma (ICP). The results showed that the adsorption capacity of GO modified polyacrylonitrile membrane to copper ion increased first and then reached adsorption equilibrium with the increase of adsorption time of copper ion. With the increase of initial concentration of copper ion and external temperature, the adsorption capacity of GO modified polyacrylonitrile membrane to copper ion followed. With the increase of solution’s PH, the adsorption capacity of GO modified polyacrylonitrile membranes for copper ions first increased and then decreased. After several desorption/adsorption of the modified membranes which have reached the adsorption equilibrium, the membranes still have good adsorption capacity for copper ions, indicating that the membranes have excellent reuse performance."

"A novel method for the preparation of covalently linked capillary coatings of polystyrene-poly (ethylene oxide) (PS-PEO) was demonstrated by using photosensitive diazoresin (DR) as coupling agents. Layer by layer (LBL) self-assembly membrane of DR and PS-PEO based on hydrogen bonding firstly was fabricated on the inner wall of capillary, then with the treatment of UV light through the unique photochemistry reaction of DR, the hydrogen bonding was converted into covalent bonding. The covalently bonded coatings have the ability of inhibiting protein adsorption on the inner surface of capillary, and thus a baseline separation of Lysozyme (Lys), cytochrome c (Cyt-c), bovine serum albumin (BSA), ribonuclease A (RNase A) and myoglobin (Mb) was achieved by using capillary electrophoresis (CE). Compared with bare capillary or non-covalently bonded DR/PS-PEO coatings, the covalently linked DR/PS-PEO capillary coatings improved the CE separation performance for proteins; what’s more, it exhibited good stability and repeatability. This method can provide a green and easy way to make the covalently coated capillaries for CE, replacing of the old way which using highly toxic and moisture sensitive silane coupling agent by DR in the covalent coating preparation."
"PAN hollow fiber functional membrane with heavy metal ion adsorption capacity was prepared via layer-by-layer method using diazo-resin (DR). Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and graphene oxide (GO) with chelating function were used as modifier. Modification effect was studied by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR), contact angle test, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the copper ion adsorption capacity measurement. The result showed that EDTA and GO were successfully grafted on the surface of modified membrane and the hydrophilicity of the modified membrane increased. Roughness of membrane surface increased when the functional groups introduced on the surface. Adsorption for Cu2+ of modified membrane significantly improved."
"Covalently linked capillary coating of sodium polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) is prepared using the layer by layer self-assembly technique combined with photochemistry reactions. PSS coating based on ionic bonding was first assembled on the inner wall of capillary by using photosensitive diazoresin (DR) as the coupling agent, and then the ionic bonding was converted into covalent bonding after treatment with UV light through a unique photochemistry reaction of DR. DR/PSS covalent coating resisted protein adsorption on the inner surface of the capillary, and thus a baseline separation of various proteins (Lys, Cyt-c, BSA and RNase A) was achieved in a short time by capillary electrophoresis (CE). Compared with bare capillary and uncrosslinked DR/PSS coating, the covalent coating has good stability and reproducibility. Because of the replacement of highly toxic and moisture-sensitive silane coupling agent by DR in the covalent coating preparation, this method may provide a green and easy way to make the covalently coated capillaries for CE."
"Protein adsorption on the inner surface of capillary is the main reason for the poor separation performance of capillary electrophoresis. Currently, many ways have been reported to inhibit protein adsorption, while they have numerous disadvantages, such as complicated, toxic and unstable. Here, by using photosensitive diazoresin (DR) as coupling agents and graphene oxide (GO) as coating, we found a simple, economic and environmental friendly approach to inhibit protein adsorption. Through layer by layer (LBL) self-assembly technique and unique photochemistry reaction of DR, a stable and efficient capillary coating could be obtained. The bare capillary, non-covalently GO coated capillary and covalently GO coated capillary were all characterized. Results indicated that the DR/GO covalently linked capillary coatings showed great separation performance of proteins with excellent stability and repeatability. Compared with bare capillary and non-covalent, better separation efficiency was achieved by covalent GO capillary column."

"Gene therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in many genetic diseases, as evidenced by recent clinical applications. Viral vectors have been extensively tested in clinical gene-therapy trials, but nonviral vectors such as cationic polymers or lipids are much less used due to their lower gene-transfection efficiencies. However, the advantages of nonviral vectors, such as easily tailored structures, nonimmunogenetics, and relatively low cost, still drive great efforts to improve their transfection efficiencies. A reverse question asks if nonviral vectors with current gene transfection efficiency can find application niches. Herein, we synthesized a cationic polymer, poly{ N-[2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl]- N-[ p-acetyloxyphenyl]- N, N-diethylammonium chloride} (PQDEA), as a gene-delivery carrier and compared it side by side with chemotherapy drugs for cancer treatment. PQDEA is rapidly hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases into anionic poly(acrylic acid) to give low cytotoxicity and fast release of DNA for expression. PQDEA formed stable complexes with DNA (PQDEA/DNA polyplexes), which were further coated with a lipid layer to make serum-stable lipidic polyplexes, LPQDEA/DNAs, for in vivo use. In an intraperitoneal tumor xenograft model mimicking late-stage metastatic cervical cancer, the LPQDEA/DNA vector with TRAIL suicide gene exerted strong tumor inhibition as effective as paclitaxel, the first-line anticancer drug, but gave much less tumor relapse and much longer survival than the clinical chemotherapy drugs, irinotecan and paclitaxel. Equally important, the gene therapy showed much fewer adverse effects than the chemotherapy drugs. This work shows that nonviral vectors with current transfection efficiencies may produce therapeutic advantages and may be safe and worthy of clinical translation in, for example, intraperitoneal cancer therapy."

"Microalgae-derived biofuels have potential advantages over other renewable, crop-based resources; however, large-scale production is not currently economical due, in part, to challenges in the harvesting step. In this article, we present a novel approach for the dewatering and harvesting of microalgae using flocculants that can be recovered and recycled. Polyampholytes with molecular charges dependent upon pH (ranging from net positively- to net negatively-charged) are used as a model flocculant system and provide reversible electrostatic interactions with the negatively-charged algal cells. These pH-dependent properties allow the polyampholytic flocculants to efficiently desorb from concentrated biomass and, unlike most commercial flocculants that have permanently charged functionalities, be recovered and recycled for further dewatering processes. The behavior of the model polyampholytic flocculants is characterized for the dewatering of Chlorella vulgaris (UTEX 395). The reversible and recyclable flocculants achieve >99% flocculation efficiencies, are recovered at more than 98 wt% yields after biomass dewatering, and can be recycled over five times for flocculation."

"CuBr ligated with N,N,N′,N″,N″-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) is a common catalyst for atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). A catalyst/initiator ratio of 0.5–1 is generally required for most CuBr/PMDETA-catalyzed polymerizations, leading to high catalyst loading and high cost of post-polymerization purification. In this work, triethanolamine is found to drastically improve the catalytical performance of CuBr/PMDETA and the strong promotion effects of triethanolamine on ATRP of methyl acrylate (MA), methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene (St) have been investigated. In the presence of triethanolamine, the catalyst loading of CuBr/PMDETA is substantially reduced from a normal catalyst/initiator ratio of 1 to 0.01, 0.05 and 0.05 respectively in the polymerization of MA, MMA and St. As CuBr/PMDETA is one of the cheapest ATRP catalysts, the combination of CuBr/PMDETA with triethanolamine further markedly decreases the catalyst consumption and reduces the cost of post-purification for ATRP at large scales, and therefore is promising for potential industrial applications."
"The deuterated homopolymers and their corresponding polystyrene-block-polybutadiene and polystyrene-block-polyisoprene copolymers require lower cloud pressures than their hydrogenous analogues to dissolve in a compressible alkane solvent, such as propane. For symmetric diblocks, deuteration reduces the micellization pressure. By contrast, for asymmetric diblocks with a long diene block relative to the styrene block, deuteration can increase the micellization pressure. All in all, however, the deuteration effects, while measurable, do not qualitatively change the principal diblock properties in compressible propane solutions, such as pressure-induced micelle decomposition, micelle formation and micelle size, and their temperature dependence. Therefore, isotope labeling should be a useful approach to neutron-scattering characterization for styrene-diene block copolymers in compressible alkane systems."

"of imidazolium-based ionic liquid monomers and their corresponding polymers (poly(ionic liquid)s) were synthesized, and their CO2 sorption was studied. The poly(ionic liquid)s had enhanced CO2 sorption capacities and fast sorption/desorption rates compared with room temperature ionic liquids. The effects of the chemical structures, including the types of anion, cation, and backbone of the poly(ionic liquid)s on their CO2 sorption have been discussed. In contrast to room temperature ionic liquids, the polymer with PF anions had the highest CO2-sorption capacity, while those with BF or Tf2N− anions had the same capacities. The CO2 sorption and desorption of the polymers were fast and reversible, and the sorption was selective over H2, N2, and O2. The measured Henry's constants of P[VBBI][BF4] and P[MABI][BF4] were 26.0 bar and 37.7 bar, which were lower than those of similar room temperature ionic liquids.

"High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a powerful tool to separate and analyze complex samples. Monodiseperse porous silica microspheres (MPSMs) have been widely used as column packings in HPLC. However, synthesis of MPSMs with controllable sizes of both particles and pores for the separation of small solutes and proteins in HPLC still remains a challenge. In this paper, an effective and facile approach to prepare MPSMs with controllable particle size and pore size by using porous polymer microspheres as templates is presented. By employing porous PGMA/EDMA microspheres as templates and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the silica source, 5 μm MPSMs with tunable pore sizes were synthesized successfully. The as-prepared MPSMs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic laser scattering, and mercury intrusion porosimetry. The results indicated that the MPSMs obtained retained the original size of the polymer templating particles and calcination caused almost no shrinkage. Furthermore, the effects of the pore size of polymer template microspheres, different amino-functionalizations of PGMA/EDMA microspheres and the mass ratio of PGMA/EDMA microspheres/TEOS on the pore size of MPSMs were carefully studied. The results indicated that the pore size of MPSMs was adjusted from 20 to 69 nm by controlling the pore size of the polymer microspheres and the mass ratio of PGMA/EDMA microspheres/TEOS in the sol-gel process. In addition, the amino-functionalization of PGMA/EDMA microspheres with different structure-directing agents, such as (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), trimethylamine hydrochloride (TMA) and tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), also resulted in MPSMs with the different pore sizes. MPSMs with large pore sizes of more than 30 nm were fabricated by using TEPA-functionalized PGMA/EDMA microspheres as templates, while with TMA-functionalized PGMA/EDMA microspheres as templates, MPSMs with pore sizes of approximately 10 nm were obtained. The as-prepared MPSMs were further modified with different silanes, such as C4, C8 and C18, to explore as stationary phases for the separation of proteins and small solutes in reversed phase liquidi chromatography (RPLC). The results illustrated that the baseline separation of 7 kinds of proteins could be achieved based on MPSMs with pore sizes of 30 nm, and 6 kinds of alkyl benzenes and 5 kinds of aromatic alcohol homologs could be separated completely based on MPSMs with pore sizes of 11 nm. This work demonstrated that MPSMs prepared by applying the polymer templating method showed a promising potential applicability in HPLC."

"In the realm of combined cancer immunotherapy, the strategic combination of therapeutics targeting both cancer cells and macrophages holds immense potential. However, the major challenges remain on how to achieve facile spatiotemporal delivery of these therapies, allowing ease of manipulation and ensuring differential drug release for enhanced synergistic therapeutic effects. In the present study, we introduced a tumor microenvironment (TME)-adapted hydrogel with the phenylboronic acid-modified dipyridamole prodrug (DIPP) as a crosslinker. This prodrug hydrogel scaffold, 3BP@DIPPGel, could be formed in situ by a simple mixture of DIPP and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and loaded with a high ratio of 3-bromopyruvic acid (3BP). The 3BP@DIPPGel enables spatiotemporal localized delivery of dipyridamole (DIP) and 3BP with distinct release kinetics that effectively reshape the immunosuppressive TME. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulation, 3BP@DIPPGel preferentially released 3BP, inducing tumor-specific pyroptosis via the ROS/BAX/caspase-3/GSDME signaling pathway and decreasing the secretion of chemokines such as CCL8 to counteract macrophage recruitment. Subsequently, the crosslinked DIP is released, triggering the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization towards the immunostimulatory M1 phenotype via the CCR2/JAK2/STAT3 cascade signaling pathway. This dual action from 3BP@DIPPGel leads to the restoration of tumor cell immunogenicity with high efficacy and activation of immune cells. Furthermore, the 3BP@DIPPGel-based chemoimmunotherapy upregulates the expression of sialic-acid-binding Ig-like lectin 10 and hence sensitizing tumors to anti-CD24 therapy in the tumor-bearing mice. Therefore, this strategy can have significant potential in the prevention of tumor metastases and recurrence. To the best of our understanding, this study represents a pioneering showcase of tumor pyroptosis, induced by glycolytic inhibitors, which can be effectively coordinated with DIP-mediated TAM polarization for immune activation, offering a new paradigm for differentially sustained drug delivery to foster cancer immunotherapy."
"Intravesical therapy (IT) is widely used to tackle various urological diseases. However, its clinical efficacy is decreased by the impermeability of various barriers presented on the bladder luminal surface, including the urinary mucus layer and the densely packed tissue barrier. In this study, we report a mucoadhesive-to-penetrating nanomotors-in-hydrogel system for urothelium-oriented intravesical drug delivery. Upon intravesical instillation, its poloxamer 407 (PLX) hydrogel gelated and adhered to the urothelium to prolong its intravesical retention. The urea afterwards diffused into the hydrogel, thus generating a concentration gradient. Urease-powered membrane nanomotors (UMN) without asymmetric surface engineering could catalyze the urea and migrate down this concentration gradient to deeply and unidirectionally penetrate the urothelial barrier. Moreover, the intravesical hybrid system-delivered gemcitabine could effectively inhibit the bladder tumor growth without inducing any side effect. Therefore, our mucoadhesive-to-penetrating nanomotors-in-hydrogel system could serve as an alternative to IT to meet the clinical need for more efficacious therapeutics for urological diseases."

"Existing strategies use bifunctional chimaeras to mediate extracellular protein degradation. However, these strategies rely on specific lysosome-trafficking receptors to facilitate lysosomal delivery, which may raise resistance concerns due to intrinsic cell-to-cell variation in receptor expression and mutations or downregulation of the receptors. Another challenge is establishing a universal platform applicable in multiple scenarios. Here, we develop MONOTAB (MOdified NanOparticle with TArgeting Binders), a plug-and-play monofunctional degradation platform that can drag extracellular targets into lysosomes for degradation. MONOTAB harnesses the inherent lysosome-targeting ability of certain nanoparticles to obviate specific receptor dependency and the hook effect. To achieve high modularity and programmable target specificity, we utilize the streptavidin-biotin interaction to immobilize antibodies or other targeting molecules on nanoparticles, through an antibody mounting approach or by direct binding. Our study reveals that MONOTAB can induce efficient degradation of diverse therapeutic targets, including membrane proteins, secreted proteins, and even extracellular vesicles."
"ique structural characteristics and chiral environment, β‐cyclodextrin (β‐CD) has a strong chiral separation ability. 4‐Chlorophenyl isocyanate (4CPI) also plays an important role in separating chiral drugs. In this paper, a chiral stationary phase: 4‐CPI‐β‐CD stationary phase (4CPI‐β‐CD@PMMA) was designed and prepared. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microspheres with uniform particle size and good monodispersity were prepared by modified seed polymerization and seed expansion methods. Using diazo resin as a coupling agent, PMMA microspheres were connected with 4CPI‐β‐CD to prepare a stationary phase with chiral recognition ability. PMMA microspheres and 4CPI‐β‐CD were also characterized. Compared with the traditional silica gel column, PMMA microspheres have higher preparation efficiency, better monodispersity, and better mechanical properties as chromatographic fillers. Finally, the chiral separation of ketoprofen was carried out by reversed‐phase high‐performance liquid chromatography, and the separation conditions were optimized. This paper is a good idea for the preparation of the chiral stationary phase."
"eter arterial embolization (TAE) in interventional therapy and tumor embolism therapy plays a significant role. The choice of embolic materials that have good biocompatibility is an essential component of TAE. For this study, we produced a multifunctional PVA embolization material that can simultaneously encapsulate Ag2S quantum dots (Ag2S QDs) and BaSO4 nanoparticles (BaSO4 NPs), exhibiting excellent second near-infrared window (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging and X-ray imaging, breaking through the limitations of traditional embolic microsphere X-ray imaging. To improve the therapeutic effectiveness against tumors, we doped the doxorubicin (DOX) antitumor drug into microspheres and combined it with a clotting peptide (RADA16-I) on the surface of microspheres. Thus, it not only embolizes rapidly during hemostasis but also continues to release and accelerate tumor necrosis. In addition, Ag2S/BaSO4/PVA microspheres (Ag2S/BaSO4/PVA Ms) exhibited good blood compatibility and biocompatibility, and the results of embolization experiments on renal arteries in rabbits revealed good embolic effects and bimodal imaging stability. Therefore, they could serve as a promising medication delivery embolic system and an efficient biomaterial for arterial embolization. Our research work achieves the applicability of NIR-II and X-ray dual-mode images for clinical embolization in biomedical imaging."

"Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is widely utilized as a hydrophilic coating to extend the circulation time and improve the tumor accumulation of polymeric micelles. Nonetheless, PEGylated micelles often activate complement proteins, leading to accelerated blood clearance and negatively impacting drug efficacy and safety. Here, we have crafted amphiphilic block copolymers that merge hydrophilic sulfoxide-containing polymers (psulfoxides) with the hydrophobic drug 7-ethyl-10-hydroxylcamptothecin (SN38) into drug-conjugate micelles. Our findings show that the specific variant, PMSEA-PSN38 micelles, remarkably reduce protein fouling, prolong blood circulation, and improve intratumoral accumulation, culminating in significantly increased anti-cancer efficacy compared with PEG-PSN38 counterpart. Additionally, PMSEA-PSN38 micelles effectively inhibit complement activation, mitigate leukocyte uptake, and attenuate hyperactivation of inflammatory cells, diminishing their ability to stimulate tumor metastasis and cause inflammation. As a result, PMSEA-PSN38 micelles show exceptional promise in the realm of anti-metastasis and significantly abate SN38-induced intestinal toxicity. This study underscores the promising role of psulfoxides as viable PEG substitutes in the design of polymeric micelles for efficacious anti-cancer drug delivery."

"e extensive use of antibiotics, many highly resistant bacteria and extensively resistant bacteria have been produced. In recent years, the increase of drug-resistant bacteria and the resulting proliferation of drug-resistant bacteria have increased the incidence of hospital-acquired infections and caused great harm to human health. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered to be an innovative antibiotic and belong to the latest advances in this field. We designed a polypeptide and verified its low minimum inhibitory concentration and broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi in microbiology and pharmacology. Several experiments have confirmed that the screened antimicrobial peptides have significant antidrug resistance and also show significant therapeutic properties in the treatment of systemic bacterial infections. In addition, through our experimental research, it was proved that the antibacterial hydrogel composed of poly(vinyl alcohol), sodium alginate, and antimicrobial peptides had excellent antibacterial properties and showed good wound healing ability."
"Cisplatin (CDDP), as a broad-spectrum anticancer drug, is able to bind to DNA and inhibit cell division. Despite the widespread use of cisplatin since its discovery, cisplatin resistance developed during prolonged chemotherapy, similar to other small molecule chemotherapeutic agents, severely limits its clinical application. Cisplatin resistance in cancer cells is mainly caused by three reasons: DNA repair, decreased cisplatin uptake/increased efflux, and cisplatin inactivation. In earlier combination therapies, the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells prevented the achievement of the desired therapeutic effect even with the accurate combination of two chemotherapeutic drugs. Therefore, combination therapy using nanocarriers for co-delivery of drugs is considered to be ideal for alleviating cisplatin resistance and reducing cisplatin-related toxicity in cancer cells. This article provides an overview of the design of cisplatin nano-drugs used to combat cancer cell resistance, elucidates the mechanisms of action of cisplatin and the pathways through which cancer cells develop resistance, and finally discusses the design of drugs and related carriers that can synergistically reduce cancer resistance when combined with cisplatin."

"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour, with ~30% mediated by Sonic hedgehog signalling. Vismodegib-mediated inhibition of the Sonic hedgehog effector Smoothened inhibits tumour growth but causes growth plate fusion at effective doses. Here, we report a nanotherapeutic approach targeting endothelial tumour vasculature to enhance blood-brain barrier crossing. We use fucoidan-based nanocarriers targeting endothelial P-selectin to induce caveolin-1-dependent transcytosis and thus nanocarrier transport into the brain tumour microenvironment in a selective and active manner, the efficiency of which is increased by radiation treatment. In a Sonic hedgehog medulloblastoma animal model, fucoidan-based nanoparticles encapsulating vismodegib exhibit a striking efficacy and marked reduced bone toxicity and drug exposure to healthy brain tissue. Overall, these findings demonstrate a potent strategy for targeted intracranial pharmacodelivery that overcomes the restrictive blood-brain barrier to achieve enhanced tumour-selective penetration and has therapeutic implications for diseases within the central nervous system."
"Transcatheter arterial embolization (TACE) has been used in the treatment of malignant tumors, sudden hemorrhage, uterine fibroids, and other diseases, and with advances in imaging techniques and devices, materials science, and drug release technology, more and more embolic agents that are drug-carrying, self-imaging, or have multiple functions are being developed. Microspheres provide safer and more effective therapeutic results as embolic agents, with their unique spherical appearance and good embolic properties. Embolic microspheres are the key to arterial embolization, blocking blood flow and nutrient supply to the tumor target. This review summarizes some of the currently published embolic microspheres, classifies embolic microspheres according to matrix, and summarizes the characteristics of the microsphere materials, the current status of research, directions, and the value of existing and potential applications. It provides a direction to promote the development of embolic microspheres towards multifunctionalization, and provides a reference to promote the research and application of embolic microspheres in the treatment of tumors."

"The synthesis of water-soluble symmetric molecules with donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) structure is reported. The compound is connected by π bridge with 2-bromofluorene external polyethylene glycol 2000 as the shielding unit, and donor component and pyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the acceptor unit. The D-A-D double donor fluorescent molecule P2-DPP is obtained by coupling reaction. The absorption peak and emission peak of the fluorescent molecule P2-DPP are 600 and 1020 nm, respectively. It has potential excellent imaging characteristics. It does not need to use nanoparticles formed by the DSPE-MPEG amphiphilic block to form micelles. The quantum yield reaches 0.6% and the penetration depth can reach 10 mm. The chemical is capable of achieving liver and renal metabolism. It has a good application prospect in the photothermal therapy of mouse tumors and realizes the integration of biological diagnosis and treatment."
"A selective tumor-penetrating strategy generally exploits tumor-targeted ligands to modify drugs so that the conjugate preferentially enters tumors and subsequently undergoes transcellular transport to penetrate tumors. However, this process shields ligands from their corresponding targets on the cell surface, possibly inducing an off-target effect during drug penetration at the tumor-normal interface. Herein, we first describe a selective tumor-penetrating drug (R11-phalloidin conjugates) for intravesical therapy of bladder cancer. The intravesical conjugates rapidly translocated across the mucus layer, specifically bound to tumors, and infiltrated throughout the tumor via direct intercellular transfer. Notably, direct transfer from normal cells to tumor cells was unidirectional because the pathways required for direct transfer, termed F-actin-rich tunneling nanotubes, were more unidirectionally extended from normal cells to tumor cells. Moreover, the intravesical conjugates displayed strong anticancer activity and well-tolerated biosafety in murine orthotopic bladder tumor models. Our study demonstrated the potential of a selective tumor-penetrating conjugate for effective intravesical anticancer therapy."
"Recent advances in the development of new materials are having a major impact on analytical chemistry. For example, the unique properties of ordered mesoporous silicas (OMSs) have been shown to enhance the analytical performance of many existing techniques or allow new, exciting ones to be developed. Likewise, the introduction of organo-functional groups makes OMSs highly versatile and enables them to perform specialized tasks, such as the separation of chiral compounds. This review provides an overview with the most relevant achievements in the preparation of OMS particles functionalized with chiral selectors. In addition, some examples from the last fifteen years regarding the analytical applications of functionalized OMS for chiral separations by high-performance liquid chromatography, ultra-high pressure high-performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrochromatography have been reviewed."
"roporous (SMP) hydrogels have garnered significant attention in biomedical applications due to their high permeability and biomimetic pore structure. However, maintaining toughness in highly porous materials remains a formidable challenge. This study introduces a facile one‐step preparation method for fabricating tough alginate hydrogels with an SMP structure by blending polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and sodium alginate cross‐linked with calcium chloride. By capitalizing on the phase separation effect, this method bypasses traditional requirements such as cryogelation and templating that necessitate low temperatures or solvent etching. The presence of PVA molecules promotes the regional aggregation of alginates, leading to enhanced toughness, and also occupies larger interstitial spaces between the densely packed alginate phases, facilitating pore formation. The resulting SMP structure, featuring pore sizes ranging from 50 µm to 700 µm, forms during the polymer cross‐linking process and achieves a porosity exceeding 85%. These hydrogels exhibit superior toughness compare to their non‐macroporous counterparts. Additionally, this method allows for flexible adjustments in the porous structure and overall gel shape, making it adaptable to various applications. This simple yet effective approach holds great potential for developing novel SMP materials with enhanced toughness."
"Second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging (FLI) has gained widespread interest in the biomedical field because of its advantages of high sensitivity and high penetration depth. In particular, rare earth-doped nanoprobes (RENPs) have shown completely different physical and chemical properties from macroscopic substances owing to their unique size and structure. This paper reviews the synthesis methods and types of RENPs for NIR-II imaging, focusing on new methods to enhance the luminous intensity of RENPs and multi-band imaging and multi-mode imaging of RENPs in biological applications. This review also presents an overview of the challenges and future development prospects based on RENPs in NIR-II regional bioimaging."
"Stem cell transplantation holds great promise for restoring function after spinal cord injury (SCI), but its therapeutic efficacy heavily depends on the innate capabilities of the cells and the microenvironment at the lesion site. Herein, a potent cell therapeutic (NCs@SCs) is engineered by artificially reprogramming bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) with oxidation-responsive transcytosable gene-delivery nanocomplexes (NCs), which endows cells with robust oxidative stress resistance and improved cytokine secretion. NCs@SCs can accumulate in the injured spinal cord after intravenous administration via chemotaxis and boost successive transcytosis to deliver NCs to neurons, augmenting ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) production in both BMSCs and neurons in response to elevated ROS levels. Furthermore, NCs@SCs can actively sense and eliminate ROS and re-educate recruited M1-like macrophages into the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype via a paracrine pathway, ultimately reshaping the inflammatory microenvironment. Synergistically, NCs@SCs exhibit durable survival and provide neuroprotection against secondary damage, enabling significant locomotor function recovery in SCI rats. Transcriptome analysis reveals that regulation of the ROS/MAPK signaling pathway is involved in SCI therapy by NCs@SCs. This study presents a nanomaterial-mediated cell-reprogramming approach for developing live cell therapeutics, showing significant potential in the treatment of SCI and other neuro-injury disorders."
"ous injection of insulin is the current standard medication for many diabetic patients. Convenient and painless noninvasive transdermal insulin delivery has long been pursued but yet succeeded due to no such technologies for large biomacromolecules. We find a tertiary amine oxide-based polyzwitterion, OPDMA, that can efficiently penetrate both the stratum corneum (SC) and viable epidermis into circulation. So its conjugate with insulin, OPDMA-I, applied on the skin can exhibit hypoglycemic effects as efficiently as subcutaneously injected insulin in type-1 diabetic mice and minipigs. The unique pH-dependent cationic-to-zwitterionic transition of OPDMA in the characteristic acidic-to-neutral pH gradient from the skin surface to deep SC enables fast transdermal delivery of OPDMA and its conjugate. On the skin, OPDMA binds to carboxylic acids in the acidic sebum layer, enriching OPDMA-I on the SC. As pH increases in deeper SC layers, binding between OPDMA-I and the skin weakens gradually, allowing for diffusion through inter-corneocyte gaps and penetration into viable epidermis and finally entering the systemic circulation via dermal lymphatic vessels. This process does not alter SC microstructures or cause any physiological changes in the skin. This study represents a groundbreaking example of noninvasive transdermal protein delivery."
"Through the study of the molecular formula of p1-AQM2AF, it is found that 9-methylenedecane, as the electron donor system, has strong electron donor capacity, but due to its huge steric hindrance, the p1-AQM2AF molecule may be seriously distorted, resulting in the reduction of the fluorescence quantum efficiency of p1-AQM2AF due to the angular momentum energy loss during the electron transmission process. Therefore, we have made a bold guess, The length of alkyl chain may also be one of the factors affecting the fluorescence efficiency of D-A-D conjugated small molecules. We converted the 9-methylene-19decane originally attached to the molecule into 3-methylenenonane, and explored its influence on the fluorescence molecule by reducing the length of the donor alkyl chain."
"Mesoporous silica microspheres, a multifunctional material with high specific surface area, pore size, and mechanical properties, are widely used as separation and support materials. Mesoporous silica, has been relatively studied as LC column packing material for separation and detection.

Excellent test results have been exhibited, the PTHP-SiO2 mesoporous has the same structure and morphology as the SiO2 microspheres, but shows excellent bacterial inactivation ability, and better separation as LC column packing material, thus can be applied as a multifunctional material."
"Malignant tumor is one of the most important causes of death in the world today. At present, the successful cure cases of tumor patients are mainly due to the timely treatment of tumors. Therefore, it has become one of the urgent problems for human beings to find tumors as soon as possible and how to completely eradicate them. The technology of simultaneous imaging and treatment through photoinitiation is a promising strategy to fight cancer. In the previous research, we developed a new small molecule p-QM2AF for photothermal therapy, but the low fluorescence efficiency (QY) in the NIR-II range made it necessary to modify it. In this paper, we obtained better imaging and photothermal conversion performance by grafting two 9- methylene nonadecanes onto the p-QM2AF sub-receptor."
"Column laminating silica gel board plays a very important role in the separation and analysis of organic synthesis, which can monitor the progress of chemical reactions in real time and help researchers determine the time when chemical reactions are completed.

"Though high brightness and biocompatible small NIR-II dyes are highly desirable in clinical or translational cancer research, their fluorescent cores are relatively limited and their synthetic processes are somewhat complicated. Herein, we have explored the design and synthesis of novel NIR-II fluorescent materials (H1) without tedious chromatographic isolation with improved fluorescence performance (QY ≈ 2%) by introducing 2-amino 9,9-dialkyl-substituted fluorene as a donor into the backbone. Several types of water-soluble and biocompatible NIR-II probes: SXH, SDH, and H1 NPs were constructed via different chemical strategies based on H1, and then their potential to be used in in vivo tumor imaging and image-guided surgery in the NIR-II region was explored. High levels of uptake were obtained for both passive and active tumor targeting probes SXH and SDH. Furthermore, high resolution imaging of blood vessels on tumors and the whole body of living mice using H1 NPs for the first time has demonstrated precise NIR-II image-guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery."
"Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) are core-shell nanoparticle structures comprising polymer cores and lipid/lipid-PEG shells, which exhibit complementary characteristics of both polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes, particularly in terms of their physical stability and biocompatibility. Significantly, the LPNs have recently been demonstrated to exhibit superior in vivo cellular delivery efficacy compared to that obtained from polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes. Since their inception, the LPNs have advanced significantly in terms of their preparation strategy and scope of applications. Their preparation strategy has undergone a shift from the conceptually simple two-step method, involving preformed polymeric nanoparticles and lipid vesicles, to the more principally complex, yet easier to perform, one-step method, relying on simultaneous self-assembly of the lipid and polymer, which has resulted in better products and higher production throughput. The scope of LPNs' applications has also been extended beyond single drug delivery for anticancer therapy, to include combinatorial and active targeted drug deliveries, and deliveries of genetic materials, vaccines, and diagnostic imaging agents. This review details the current state of development for the LPNs preparation and applications from which we identify future research works needed to bring the LPNs closer to its clinical realization."
"hment rate of drugs in tumors seriously affects the effect of tumor treatment. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) could penetrate deeply into the tumor and accumulate in hypoxic areas. Therefore, using TAMs to deliver drugs can effectively increase the enrichment rate. However, as immune cell, macrophages will clear the internal drugs and their antitumor activity. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) can inhibit the decomposition ability of TAMs and stay stable in macrophages. Herein, we prepared a Bacillus-mimic liposome by embedding the fragments of M. tuberculosis into the liposome. In vitro experiments showed that it can stay stable in TAMs for at least 29 h without decomposing. Then, TAMs would burst as they gobble up materials and cannot digest them. Thus, the prepared liposome could ""domesticate"" TAMs and kill macrophages after they are used up, further destroy the tumor microenvironment, and finally kill the tumor. Cytotoxicity experiments confirmed that it has a certain killing effect on macrophages, tumor cells, and normal cells. In vivo tumor suppression experiments confirmed that it has the effect of inhibiting tumor growth."

"Drug delivery systems are created to achieve the desired therapeutic effect of a specific pharmaceutical compound. Numerous drawbacks and side effects such as unfavorable pharmacokinetics, lack of tissue selectivity, immunogenicity, increased systemic clearance and toxicity, have been observed for currently available drug delivery systems (DDSs). The use of natural and artificial extracellular vesicles (EVs) in drug delivery may help to solve the aforementioned problems faced by different DDSs. Due to their self-origin, small size, flexibility, the presence of multiple adhesive molecules on their surfaces as well as their function as biomolecules carriers, EVs are the perfect candidates for DDSs. Currently, several drug delivery systems based on EVs have been proposed. While the great potential of these particles in targeted drug delivery has been recognized in cancer, hepatitis C, neurodegenerative diseases, inflammatory states etc., this field is still in the early stage of development. Unfortunately, the use of EVs from natural sources (cell cultures, body fluids) results in numerous problems in terms of the heterogeneity of isolated vesicle population as well as the method of isolation thereof, which may influence vesicle composition and properties. Therefore, there is a significant need for the synthesis of artificial EV-based DDSs under strictly controlled laboratory conditions and from well-defined biomolecules (proteins and lipids). Vesicle-mimetic delivery systems, characterized by properties similar to natural EVs, will bring new opportunities to study the mechanisms of DDS internalization and their biological activity after delivering their cargo to a target cell."

"Recently, hollow structures have attracted much attention due to their high specific surface area, clear interior space, low density and good permeability. Among them, manganese dioxide (MnO2) hollow structure has also been widely studied for catalysis, drug delivery and energy storage. Based on the characteristics of low pH and high GSH concentration in tumor microenvironment, it is possible to develop an intelligent drug delivery system with pH/GSH response based on hollow mesoporous MnO2 nanospheres. In addition, the excellent physical and chemical properties of MnO2 nanomaterials provide conditions for its synergistic photothermal therapy. For example, Mn2+ released after manganese dioxide reacts with GSH can enhance T1-MAGNETIC resonance (MR) imaging. Meanwhile, manganese dioxide can also react with H2O2 in tumor microenvironment to release oxygen and alleviate tumor hypoxia. In order to prevent drug loss during delivery, a GSH-responsive hollow mesoporous manganese dioxide microsphere was selected as the drug carrier in this paper, and a series of studies were carried out on the performance of the carrier. Hollow mesoporous MnO2 nanospheres with particle size below 100 nm were prepared by hydrothermal method, and their response to tumor microenvironment was simulated in vitro. It has been proved that hollow mesoporous MnO2 nanospheres can be desorbed at low pH and GSH response, and can be used to deliver drugs or photothermal agents, as well as for collaborative cancer imaging and treatment."

"The design and development of a smart bioadhesive hydrogel sealant with self-healing and excellent antibacterial activity to achieve high wound closure effectiveness and post-wound-closure care is highly desirable in clinical applications. In this work, a series of adhesive antioxidant antibacterial self-healing hydrogels with promising traits were designed through dual-dynamic-bond cross-linking among ferric iron (Fe), protocatechualdehyde (PA) containing catechol and aldehyde groups and quaternized chitosan (QCS) to enable the closure of skin incisions and promotion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-infected wound healing. The dual-dynamic-bond cross-linking of a pH-sensitive coordinate bond (catechol-Fe) and dynamic Schiff base bonds with reversible breakage and re-formation equips the hydrogel with excellent autonomous healing and on-demand dissolution or removal properties. Additionally, the hydrogel presents injectability, good biocompatibility and antibacterial activity, multifunctional adhesiveness, and hemostasis as well as NIR responsiveness. The in vivo evaluation in a rat skin incision model and infected full-thickness skin wound model revealed the high wound closure effectiveness and post-wound-closure care of the smart hydrogels, demonstrating its great potential in dealing with skin incisions and infected full-thickness skin wounds."
"icrospheres have been widely used as a stationary phase for liquid chromatography. In this work, we prepared and synthesized polystyrene-methyl methacrylate (PS-PMMA) microspheres, modified them, characterized the microspheres to have good chromatographic properties, and then used them as a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) stationary phase to explore their applications. First, the PS-PMMA microspheres were hydrolyzed, and the separation of benzene homologues/alkaloids was explored. Then, on the basis of hydrolysis, diazo resin (DR) was used as a coupling agent to further modify the surface of the microspheres with amphoteric glycopeptide vancomycin. The modified microspheres were used as a HPLC stationary phase to explore the application of the stationary phase in the separation of chiral drugs. This work is important to broaden the application of functional chiral columns for antibiotics and to expand the application of PS-PMMA microspheres in HPLC."
"lexes have received extensive attention lately in gene therapy delivery. However, the interactions between the polyplex and the liposome and their underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we adopted a simple model, mainly to illustrate the impact of polyplex charge density on the self-assembly of liposomes (containing DOPE and CHEMS lipids) using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulation results show that when the charge density increases in the polyplex, more lipids, especially CHEMS (a negatively charged helper lipid) lipids, are attracted to the polyplex (positively charged) surface, and meanwhile nearby water molecules are driven away from the polyplex, resulting in a less spherical liposome. Energy decomposition analyses further reveal that, at higher charge densities, the polyplex exhibits much stronger interactions with CHEMS lipids than with water molecules, with the majority contribution from electrostatic interactions. In addition, the mobility of lipids, especially CHEMS, is reduced as the polyplex charge density increases, indicating a more rigid liposome. Overall, our molecular dynamics simulations elucidate the influence of polyplex charge density on the liposome self-assembly process at the atomic level, which provides a complementary approach to experiments for a better understanding of this promising gene therapy delivery system."

"The negative symptoms of schizophrenia without effective therapeutic agents seriously affect the quality of life. Studies investigating the neurobiological mechanisms of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia failed to provide a unanimous conclusion, but generally accepted to be related to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Resveratrol is a kind of natural plant polyphenol and has a potential role in negative symptoms treatment for its neuroprotective effects. To investigate the metabolic mechanism of the negative symptoms and the therapeutic effect of resveratrol on it, we analyzed the metabolic changes in the PFC of MK-801-induced schizophrenia model using ex vivo 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. And then, after chromic administration of resveratrol, we tested the social interaction behaviors of the schizophrenia model and analyzed the metabolic changes in the PFC. Our results showed that the levels of alanine (Ala), glutamate (Glu), tautine (Tau), glynine (Gly), choline (Cho), and valine (Val) are significantly decreased compared to control animals. The social deficits of MK-801-treated mice are improved after resveratrol administration. And the levels of Glu, Gly, and Cho were reversed after the treatment of resveratrol. In conclusion, our results suggest that the negative symptoms are associated with decreased concentration of Ala, Glu, Tau, Gly, Cho, Val in PFC and the social deficits could be recovered by resveratrol treatment, as well as the levels of Glu, Gly, and Cho in PFC."

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared spectroscopy, contact angle, thermogravimetric analysis (TG), water flux and adsorption properties of heavy metals were studied.

Carbonyl and carboxyl groups appeared on the surface of the modified PAN membranes; layer-by-layer self-assembly modification did not destroy the original morphology of PAN membranes, resulting in smaller pore size and higher surface roughness; hydrophilicity of the modified PAN-(DR-GO)3 membranes. The contact angle of pure water decreases from 87.8 degrees to 55.5 degrees, and the water flux increases from 733.30 g.m−1.h−1 to 1250.48 g.m−1.h−1. The thermo gravimetric curves of PAN films before and after modification did not change significantly, and the PAN films before and after modification had good thermal stability.

"The modifying effects of polymer on bitumen low-temperature performance are substantially compromised by the thermal breakdown of styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) polymer during bitumen mixture production operations. The efficacy of the utilization of Sasobit/waste cooking oil (Sasobit/WCO) as a warm-mix additive has been demonstrated in mitigating the adverse consequences of thermal aging on SBR-modified bitumen binder (SB) while preserving the binder's original performance characteristics. However, few studies have been conducted to further investigate the rheological properties and aging resistance of SB modified with Sasobit/WCO compounds. In this work, three additives-Sasobit, WCO, and Sasobit/WCO composite-were selected, and their effects on the physical and rheological characteristics of SB as well as the temperatures at which the mixtures were prepared were assessed. In addition, by using dynamic shear rheometers (DSR) and bending beam rheometers (BBR), the effects of this innovative warm-mix addition on the performance grade (PG) and aging resistances of SB were evaluated. According to the results, Sasobit/WCO composites outperform Sasobit and WCO in lowering the mixture preparation temperature. Sasobit/WCO also improves both the high- and low-temperature performance of SB simultaneously. Compared to hot-mix asphalt mixtures, the addition of Sasobit/WCO reduces the preparation temperature of the bitumen mixtures by 19 °C, which in turn helps to minimize the negative effects of temperature aging on the functioning of the SB. Additionally, the Sasobit/WCO composite addition can improve the SB mixture's resistance to thermal cracking. After the introduction of Sasobit/WCO, the high-temperature PG of SB was raised by two levels, regardless of whether the warm-mix impact was taken into account. With the addition of Sasobit/WCO, SB's resilience to short-term aging was enhanced."

"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the world's deadliest and fastest-growing tumors, with a poor prognosis. HCC develops in the context of chronic liver disease. Curative resection, surgery (liver transplantation), trans-arterial chemoembolization, radioembolization, radiofrequency ablation and chemotherapy are common treatment options for HCC, however, they will only assist a limited percentage of patients. Current treatments for advanced HCC are ineffective and aggravate the underlying liver condition. Despite promising preclinical and early-phase clinical trials for some drugs, existing systemic therapeutic methods for advanced tumor stages remain limited, underlining an unmet clinical need. In current years, cancer immunotherapy has made significant progress, opening up new treatment options for HCC. HCC, on the other hand, has a variety of causes and can affects the body's immune system via a variety of mechanisms. With the speedy advancement of synthetic biology and genetic engineering, a range of innovative immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors [anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4, and anti-PD ligand 1 cell death antibodies], therapeutic cancer vaccines, engineered cytokines, and adoptive cell therapy have all been used for the treatment of advanced HCC. In this review, we summarize the present clinical and preclinical landscape of immunotherapies in HCC, critically discuss recent clinical trial outcomes, and address future perspectives in the field of liver cancer."

Core-shell spheres can have better properties of photocatalytic performance because of the interaction between the core and shell layers with stable core materials. TiO2@SiO2 core-shell microspheres belong to inorganic core-shell microspheres which have gained more and more attention. In this paper, diazo-resin (DR) was chosento crosslink shell and core, which can be a novel way in the synthesis of monodisperse TiO2@DR@SiO2 core-shell microspheres. Because of core-shell structures with TiO2 surface, the obtained TiO2@DR@SiO2 microspheres can be used as photocatalysts."

"The surface charge of nanoparticles (NPs) plays an essential role in determining their biological properties both in vitro and in vivo. In view of the complex features associated with the biological or physiological microenvironment of solid tumors, such as electrostatic interactions between NPs and serum components, cellular membrane, or intracellular organelles, drug-loaded NPs (or nanocarriers) should intelligently accommodate such unique extra- or intracellular microenvironment in order to achieve maximum therapeutic and/or diagnostic efficacy. To that end, the surface charge of nanocarriers needs to be readily converted at the target site by means of charge reversal, i.e., conversion from anionic to cationic, or vice versa, depending on specific microenvironment. In such a manner, the payloads could be efficiently released at the desired tumor site. This review discusses 1) the physicochemical aspects related to long-circulating nanocarriers for systemic applications; 2) the recent progress in charge-reversal nanocarriers, which are loaded with drugs, nucleic acids, proteins or imaging agents and triggered by various biological signals (i.e., pH, redox, ROS or enzyme) associated with tumor microenvironment, with an emphasis on those induced by acidic tumoral pH; and 3) the perspectives of charge-reversal nanocarriers regarding thorough investigations on how the chemical structure of charge-reversal moiety temporally affects the responsiveness of the resulting nanocarriers toward the rational design of precision cancer nanomedicine."

"To investigate if different exercise training would induce different metabolic phenotype response and corticosterone (CORT) activation in rats with different combinations of restricted-fator high-fat-diet. METHODS: Fifty-three rats were randomly assigned into non-exercise (NE) with restricted-fat-diet (RFD), mild-intensity endurance exercise (MEE) with RFD, high-intensity interval exercise (HIE) with RFD, NE with high-fat-diet (HFD), MEE with HFD, and HIE with HFD. All exercise groups were trained for 10 weeks with matched running distances. Dietary intake, body weight, fat weight, metabolic blood chemicals, and serum CORT concentration were measured and analyzed. Histological lipid droplets in liver were observed. SPSS for Windows 18.0 was used for the statistical analyses and a significant level was set at P≤0.05. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in caloric intake was observed between RFD and HFD groups. NE rats with HFD led to high level of body weight, fat weight, blood glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and lipid vacuoles in hepatic histology, but low level of quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). HIE rats with HFD improved metabolic phonotype, reduced body weight (406.7±18.9 g, P<0.001), showed lower blood glucose (8.6±0.7 mmol/L, P<0.01) and lipid profiles, but higher QUICKI (0.298±0.004, P<0.01). The levels of CORT in HFD groups were much higher compared to those in RFD groups (P<0.001), especially in NE rats. HIE training significantly reduced the CORT concentration in HFD rats (41.1±0.6 ng/ml, P<0.001). Correlations analyses revealed that CORT levels were significantly associated with fat weights (r=0.50, P<0.001), blood glucose (r=0.52, P<0.001), and triglycerides (r=0.28, P<0.05), while it inversely correlated with QUICKI (r=-0.38, P<0.01) for all groups. CONCLUSIONS: HIE training and HFD, independently and/or synergistically, have profound effects on metabolic phenotype and stress response. HFD could induce metabolic disorder and elicit the exacerbated stress response by stimulating elevated serum CORT and imbalance blood chemicals. HIE training contribute to the improvement in metabolic phenotypes and the decreases in serum CORT levels so as to reduce susceptibility to high-fat stress-associated disorders."

"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are a rapidly growing class of targeted cancer treatments, but the field has experienced significant challenges from their complex design. This study examined the multiscale distribution of sacituzumab govitecan (SG; Trodelvy), a recently clinically approved ADC, to clarify the mechanism(s) of efficacy given its unique design strategy. We employed a multiscale quantitative pharmacokinetic approach, including near-infrared fluorescence imaging, single-cell flow cytometry measurements, payload distribution via γH2AX pharmacodynamic staining, and a novel dual-labeled fluorescent technique to track the ADC and payload in a high trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 expression xenograft model of gastric cancer (NCI-N87). We found that rapid release of the SN-38 payload from the hydrolysable linker inside cells imparts more DNA damage in vitro and in vivo than an ADC with a more stable enzyme cleavable linker. With SG, little to no extracellular payload release in the tumor was observed using a dual-labeled fluorescence technique, although bystander effects were detected. The high dosing regimen allowed the clinical dose to reach the majority of cancer cells, which has been linked to improved efficacy. In addition, the impact of multiple doses (day 1 and day 8) of a 21-day cycle was found to further improve tissue penetration despite not changing tumor uptake [percent injected dose per gram (%ID/g)] of the ADC. These results show increased ADC efficacy with SG can be attributed to efficient tumor penetration and intracellular linker cleavage after ADC internalization. This quantitative approach to study multiscale delivery can be used to inform the design of next-generation ADCs and prodrugs for other targets."

"Although nanoparticle-based chemotherapeutic strategies have gained in popularity, the efficacy of such therapies is still limited in part due to the different nanoparticle sizes needed to best accommodate different parts of the drug delivery pathway. Herein, we describe a nanogel-based nanoassembly based on the entrapment of ultrasmall starch nanoparticles (size 10-40 nm) within disulfide-crosslinked chondroitin sulfate-based nanogels (size 150-250 nm) to address this challenge. Upon exposure of the nanoassembly to the reductive tumor microenvironment, the chondroitin sulfate-based nanogel can degrade to release the doxorubicin-loaded starch nanoparticles in the tumor to facilitate improved intratumoral penetration. CT26 colon carcinoma spheroids could be efficiently penetrated by the nanoassembly (resulting in 1 order of magnitude higher DOX-derived fluorescence inside the spheroid relative to free DOX), while in vivo experiments showed that doxorubicin-loaded nanoassemblies reduced tumor sizes by 6× relative to saline controls and 2× relative to free DOX after 21 days. Together, these data suggest that nanogel-based nanoassemblies are a viable option for improving the efficacy and safety of nanoparticle-based drug delivery vehicles treating cancer."

"Recently, nanoplatforms with multiple functions, such as tumor-targeting drug carriers, MRI, optical imaging, thermal therapy etc., have become popular in the field of cancer research. The present study reports a novel multi-functional liposome for cancer theranostics. A dual targeted drug delivery with radiofrequency-triggered drug release and imaging based on the magnetic field influence was used advantageously for tumor multi-mechanism therapy. In this system, the surface of fullerene (C60) was decorated with iron oxide nanoparticles, and PEGylation formed a hybrid nanosystem (C60-Fe3O4-PEG2000). Thermosensitive liposomes (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, DPPC) with DSPE-PEG2000-folate wrapped up the hybrid nanosystem and docetaxel (DTX), which were designed to combine features of biological and physical (magnetic) drug targeting for fullerene radiofrequency-triggered drug release. The magnetic liposomes not only served as powerful tumor diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, but also as powerful agents for photothermal ablation of tumors. Furthermore, a remarkable thermal therapy combined chemotherapy multi-functional liposome nanoplatform converted radiofrequency energy into thermal energy to release drugs from thermosensitive liposomes, which was also observed during both in vitro and in vivo treatment. The multi-functional liposomes also could selectively kill cancer cells in highly localized regions via their excellent active tumor targeting and magnetic targeted abilities."

"sses of jellyfish-shaped amphiphilic dendrimers composed of 7 hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) arms and 14 hydrophobic polyester dendrons with β-cyclodextrin (βCD) as the core molecule were synthesized by a facile method. Seven PEG chains were first conjugated to the C-6 positions of native βCD. Subsequently, dendritic polyester architectures were constructed from the remaining 14 secondary hydroxyl groups at C-2 and C-3 positions of the βCD moiety, resulting in jellyfish-shaped amphiphilic dendrimers of different generations (7PEG-βCD-Gx) with well-defined molecular structures. The amphiphilic dendrimers self-assembled into different morphologies dependent upon the hydrophilic fraction of the dendrimers, and very surprisingly, the fourth-generation dendrimers consisting of only several percent of PEG could form aggregates with extremely narrow size distributions."
"In vivo monitoring of the biodistribution and activation of prodrugs is urgently required. Near infrared (NIR) fluorescence-active fluorophores with excellent photostability are preferable for tracking drug release in vivo. Herein, we describe a NIR prodrug DCM-S-CPT and its polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid (PEG-PLA) loaded nanoparticles as a potent cancer therapy. We have conjugated a dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran derivative as the NIR fluorophore with camptothecin (CPT) as the anticancer drug using a disulfide linker. In vitro experiments verify that the high intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations in tumor cells cause cleavage of the disulfide linker, resulting in concomitantly the active drug CPT release and significant NIR fluorescence turn-on with large Stokes shift (200 nm). The NIR fluorescence of DCM-S-CPT at 665 nm with fast response to GSH can act as a direct off-on signal reporter for the GSH-activatable prodrug. Particularly, DCM-S-CPT possesses much better photostability than ICG, which is highly desirable for in situ fluorescence-tracking of cancer chemotherapy. DCM-S-CPT has been successfully utilized for in vivo and in situ tracking of drug release and cancer therapeutic efficacy in living animals by NIR fluorescence. DCM-S-CPT exhibits excellent tumor-activatable performance when intravenously injected into tumor-bearing nude mice, as well as specific cancer therapy with few side effects. DCM-S-CPT loaded in PEG-PLA nanoparticles shows even higher antitumor activity than free CPT, and is also retained longer in the plasma. The tumor-targeting ability and the specific drug release in tumors make DCM-S-CPT as a promising prodrug, providing significant advances toward deeper understanding and exploration of theranostic drug-delivery systems."

The reaction solution of each generation contains only the targeted dendrimer macromolecules; thus, the only required separation is simple precipitation. The resulting hydroxyl-terminated fifth-gener- ation dendrimer is thermoresponsive with a LCST of 41 °C.

We report the first robust hybrid bilayer systems readily coassembled from amphiphilic dendrimers and a naturally occurring phospholipid. Both concentration and generation of the dendrimers have direct impacts on the biophysical properties of the coassemblies. Raising the dendrimer concentration increases the hybrid bilayer stability, while changes in the generation and the concentration of the embedded dendrimers impact the fluidity of the coassembled systems. Multivalent dendrimer amine terminals allow for nondestructive in situ derivatization, providing a convenient approach to decorate and modulate the local environment of the hybrid bilayer. The coassembly of lipid/dendrimer interfaces offers a unique platform for the creation of hybrid systems with modular and precisely controllable behavior for further applications in sensing and drug delivery."

Nanocarriers for drug delivery based on the EPR effect targeted to cell cytosol subject to various intracellular drug-resistance mechanisms which limited their access to the cell nuclei and mitigated the pharmacological actions of DNA-damaged anti-cancer drugs. We developed various kinds of nuclear-targeted chargereversal nanoparticles (TCRNs) which can directly localize and release drug molecules into the nucleus, circumventing both the membrane-associated multidrug resistance and the intracellular drug resistance mechanisms. The cationic primary amines of TCRNs are amidized as acid-labile beta-carboxylic amides to shield the positive charges in blood circulation, but hydrolyzed to regenerate once in cancer cells acidic lysosomes, leading to the TCRNs escape from the lysosomes and traverse into the nucleus. The in vitro and in vivo administrations of TCRNs exhibited higher antitumor efficacy and fewer side effects, showing great promises for TCRNs in future applications."
"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is an ongoing global pandemic associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. RT-qPCR has become the diagnostic standard for the testing of SARS-CoV-2 in most countries. COVID-19 diagnosis generally relies upon RT-qPCR-mediated identification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, which is costly, labor-extensive, and requires specialized training and equipment. Herein, we established a novel one-tube rapid diagnostic approach based upon formamide and colorimetric RT-LAMP (One-Pot RT-LAMP) that can be used to diagnose COVID-19 without the extraction of specific viral RNA. The technique could visually detect SARS-CoV-2 within 45 min with a limit of detection of 5 copies per reaction in extracted RNA, and about 7.66 virus copies per μL in viral transport medium. The One-Pot RT-LAMP test showed a high specificity without cross-reactivity with 12 viruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and human infectious influenza virus (H1N1/H3N2 of influenza A and B virus, ect. We validated this One-Pot RT-LAMP approach by its successful use for the analysis of 45 clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples, yielding results identical to those of traditional RT-qPCR analyses, while achieving good selectivity and sensitivity relative to a commercial RT-qPCR approach. As such, this One-Pot RT-LAMP technology may be a valid means of conducting high-sensitivity, low-cost and rapid SARS-CoV-2 identification without the extraction of viral RNA."
"Microalgae-derived biofuels have potential advantages over other renewable, crop-based resources; however, large-scale production is not currently economical due, in part, to challenges in the harvesting step. In this article, we present a novel approach for the dewatering and harvesting of microalgae using flocculants that can be recovered and recycled. Polyampholytes with molecular charges dependent upon pH (ranging from net positively- to net negatively-charged) are used as a model flocculant system and provide reversible electrostatic interactions with the negatively-charged algal cells. These pH-dependent properties allow the polyampholytic flocculants to efficiently desorb from concentrated biomass and, unlike most commercial flocculants that have permanently charged functionalities, be recovered and recycled for further dewatering processes. The behavior of the model polyampholytic flocculants is characterized for the dewatering of Chlorella vulgaris (UTEX 395). The reversible and recyclable flocculants achieve >99% flocculation efficiencies, are recovered at more than 98 wt% yields after biomass dewatering, and can be recycled over five times for flocculation."

"esearch Institute and the University of Wyoming Enhanced Oil Recovery Institute have tested a novel approach to carbon dioxide capture in power plants and industrial operations. This approach is expected to provide considerable cost savings, in terms of regeneration of the sorbent. It is proposed that low molecular weight, low volatility liquid fluorocarbons be utilized to absorb CO{sub 2} due to their unusual affinity for the gas. The energy savings would be realized by cooling the fluorocarbon liquids below their melting point where the CO{sub 2} would be released even at elevated pressure. Thus, the expense of heating currently used sorbents, saturated with CO{sub 2}, under low pressure conditions and then having to compress the released gas would not be realized. However, these fluorinated materials have been shown to be poor carbon dioxide absorbers under conditions currently required for carbon capture. The project was terminated."
": Chemo-resistant breast cancer cells overexpress not only membrane-associated but also many cytosolic drug-resistance mechanisms to limit the access of DNA-toxins to the nucleus, causing low chemotherapeutic efficacy. The project aims to synthesize and evaluate a conjugate that can enter and deliver DNA-toxins doxorubicin (DOX) or camptothecin (CPT) to the nuclei of breast cancer cells. In this project, a polyethyleneimine (PEI) was used as a nuclear localizing carrier, and was functionalized with folic acid as targeting groups and CPT as a DNA-toxin. The PEI carrier was modified to be negatively charged in the bloodstream to shield its cationic charges and thereby inhibit its interaction with cells before reaching tumors, but once in acidic tumor interstitium or tumor cells' acidic lysosomes, the PEl is regenerate for cellular uptake and nuclear localization. The PEI-based conjugate could enter the breast cancer cells efficiently and traverse to their nuclei. The carried CPT showed much higher cytotoxicity to breast cancer cells than CPT itself. Similarly, a cationic polylysine-based conjugate was also synthesized and similar results were obtained."
"The use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) has been under investigation for the treatment of several unmet medical needs, including acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) wherein siRNA may be implemented to modify the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines at the mRNA level. The properties such as clear anatomy, accessibility, and relatively low enzyme activity make the lung a good target for local siRNA therapy. However, the translation of siRNA is restricted by the inefficient delivery of siRNA therapeutics to the target cells due to the properties of naked siRNA. Thus, this review will focus on the various delivery systems that can be used and the different barriers that need to be surmounted for the development of stable inhalable siRNA formulations for human use before siRNA therapeutics for ALI/ARDS become available in the clinic."

Zn-NTTA with two types of dinuclear paddlewheel building blocks-{Zn2(OOC-)4} and {Zn2(OOC-)3}. The high uptake of CO2 (115.6 cm3·g-1) and selectivity over N2 (30:1) at 273 K indicated that these MOFs are excellent candidates for postcombustion CO2 isolation and capture. The MOFs feature high catalytic activity, rapid dynamics of transformation and excellent stability with turnover number (TON) values up to 110 000 per paddlewheel unit after 5 × 6 rounds of recyclability, demonstrating that they are promising heterogeneous catalysts for CO2 cyclo-addition to value-added cyclic carbonates. The cycloaddition of epoxides with wet gases demonstrated that the catalyst activity was not affected by moisture, and the indices of the PXRD patterns of the bulk samples filtered from the catalytic reaction revealed that the crystallinities were maintained. The combination of the selective capture and catalytic transformation in one-pot enables the use of a negative-cost feedstock-raw power plant flue gas without any separation and purification-revealing the broad prospects of such MOFs for practical CO2 fixation in industry."

"Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) generally requires a catalyst/initiator molar ratio of 0.1 to 1 and catalyst/monomer molar ratio of 0.001 to 0.01 (i.e., catalyst concentration: 1000-10,000 ppm versus monomer). Herein, we report a new copper-based complex CuBr/N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) as a versatile and highly active catalyst for acrylic, methacrylic, and styrenic monomers. The catalyst mediated ATRP at a catalyst/initiator molar ratio of 0.005 and produced polymers with well-controlled molecular weights and low polydispersities. ATRP occurred even at a catalyst/initiator molar ratio as low as 0.001 with copper concentration in the produced polymers as low as 6-8 ppm (catalyst/monomer molar ratio = 10(-5)). The catalyst structures were studied by X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy. The activator CuIBr/TPEN existed in solution as binuclear and mononuclear complexes in equilibrium but as a binuclear complex in its single crystals. The deactivator CuIIBr2/TPEN complex was mononuclear. High stability and appropriate KATRP (ATRP equilibrium constant) were found crucial for the catalyst working under high dilution or in coordinating solvents/monomers. This provides guidance for further design of highly active ATRP catalysts."

"Polysaccharides are capable of being modified by polycations to adjust their physical and chemical properties, which accordingly are considered as potential candidate materials for safe and efficient gene delivery. Here, we extracted and purified polysaccharides from rice bran, and their physicochemical properties were determined by various methods. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) modified rice bran polysaccharide (PRBP) was prepared by grafting RBP with low molecular weight PEI and the preparation was determined by FTIR. The potential of PRBP as a gene vector was systematically evaluated in vitro. The results show that PRBP can compact DNA and form PRBP/DNA polylexes with a particle size of 50-100 nm. The PRBP/DNA polylexes can protect DNA degradation from DNase I efficiently. Compared with PEI, higher transfection efficiency was achieved by the PRBP. At weight ratio of 3, the highest efficiency of gene transfection mediated by PRBP-2000 was obtained, which was 37.5% and significantly higher than PEI and commercial reagents (calcium phosphate cell transfection kit) and was closed to lipo6000. Furthermore, according to MTT results, the cytotoxicity of PRBP is much lower than that of PEI, especially for PEI2000.

"hat when FeBr2 or FeCl2 was used to mediate ATRP in the presence of ionic liquids, no ligand was need, but copper mediated ATRP of MMA required the presence of organic ligands when the ionic liquid had a halide or a carbonate anion, but not with a phosphonate anion. Even though the biphasic ATRP using ionic liquids indeed facilitates the catalyst separation, the use of a large quantity of ionic liquids (Scheme1a) is still not economically applicable in industry. In this paper, we tethered the catalyst onto an ionic liquid and directly used it for biphasic ATRP of MMA. By this way, we can greatly reduce the amount of ionic liquid used (0.05 wt% of the organic solvent, Scheme1b). The polymerization was well-controlled with resulting polymer polydispersity around 1.2-1.3. The catalyst could be easily separated from the polymer solution. After regenerated with copper metal, the catalyst could be re-used with even higher activity and similar control to that of fresh catalyst.

We also demonstrated that poly(ionic liquid) brushes with gradient thickness and wettability were easily accessible by regulating the distance between the opposite plates of Fe0 SI-ATRP. Moreover, the resultant poly(ionic liquid) brushes presented excellent antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli (99.2%) and Bacillus subtilis (88.1%) after 24 h and low attachment for proteins and marine algae (≤5%) for over 2 weeks.

At room temperature, the catalyst assembled on the silica gel support by hydrogen bonding, and thus could be recovered and reused for a second run of ATRP. The recovered catalyst still mediated a living polymerization of MMA with reduced activity (54-64%), but had much improved control of the polymerization. The resulting PMMA had molecular weights very close to theoretical vales."

"organic compounds (VOCs) have been found to be a major contributor to air pollution in many chemical and industrial processes. Recently, a new class of solvents–ionic liquids, which are chemically stable and non-volatile liquid organic salts at temperatures less than 100 C, have attracted widespread interest due to its negligible volatility, nonflammability and high ionic conductivity. In contrast to volatile organic compounds, ionic liquids have no measurable vapor pressure. Ionic liquids have been explored as green solvents for organic synthesis, liquid-liquid extraction and liquid-gas separation."

" much attention has been paid to poly (e-caprolactone) (PCL) since it is biodegradable with the release of nontoxic byproduct in vivo and miscible with a variety of polymers. Therefore it has already been used as materials of sustaining drug release, dental prostheses, as well as a new raw material of polyurethanes and long life plasticizer of poly(vinyl chloride)."

"Polymer microspheres have been widely used as a stationary phase for liquid chromatography. In this work, we prepared and synthesized polystyrene-methyl methacrylate (PS-PMMA) microspheres, modified them, characterized the microspheres to have good chromatographic properties, and then used them as a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) stationary phase to explore their applications. First, the PS-PMMA microspheres were hydrolyzed, and the separation of benzene homologues/alkaloids was explored. Then, on the basis of hydrolysis, diazo resin (DR) was used as a coupling agent to further modify the surface of the microspheres with amphoteric glycopeptide vancomycin. The modified microspheres were used as a HPLC stationary phase to explore the application of the stationary phase in the separation of chiral drugs. This work is important to broaden the application of functional chiral columns for antibiotics and to expand the application of PS-PMMA microspheres in HPLC."

"The design and use of materials in the nanoscale size range for addressing medical and health-related issues continues to receive increasing interest. Research in nanomedicine spans a multitude of areas, including drug delivery, vaccine development, antibacterial, diagnosis and imaging tools, wearable devices, implants, high-throughput screening platforms, etc. using biological, nonbiological, biomimetic, or hybrid materials. Many of these developments are starting to be translated into viable clinical products. Here, we provide an overview of recent developments in nanomedicine and highlight the current challenges and upcoming opportunities for the field and translation to the clinic."
"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal human cancers that currently does not have effective therapies. Novel treatments including nanomedicines and combination therapies are thus urgently needed for these types of deadly diseases. A key feature of pancreatic cancer is its tumor protective dense stroma, which is generated by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The interaction between CAFs and pancreatic cancer cells abnormally activates sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling and facilitates tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance. Here, we report that the commercial SHH inhibitor GDC-0449 reverses fibroblast-induced resistance to doxorubicin in Smoothened (SMO)-positive pancreatic cancer cells by downregulating SHH signaling proteins. Importantly, the synergistic combination of GDC-0449 with PEG-PCL-Dox exhibited potent antitumor efficacy in a BxPC-3 tumor xenograft model, whereas single treatments did not significantly inhibit tumor growth. Our findings reveal a potential treatment strategy for fibroblast-enriched pancreatic cancer."

"Surface-tethered poly(ionic liquid) brushes have attracted considerable attention in widespread fields, from bioengineering to marine antifouling. However, their applications have been constrained due to the poor polymerization efficiency and sophisticated operation process. In this work, we efficiently synthesized the poly(ionic liquid) brushes with unparalleled speed (up to 98 nm h-1) through Fe0-mediated surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (Fe0 SI-ATRP) while consuming only microliter of monomer solution under ambient conditions. We also demonstrated that poly(ionic liquid) brushes with gradient thickness and wettability were easily accessible by regulating the distance between the opposite plates of Fe0 SI-ATRP. Moreover, the resultant poly(ionic liquid) brushes presented excellent antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli (99.2%) and Bacillus subtilis (88.1%) after 24 h and low attachment for proteins and marine algae (≤5%) for over 2 weeks. This research provided pathways to the facile and controllable fabrication of poly(ionic liquid) materials for marine antifouling applications."
"r drugs embedded in or conjugated with inert nanocarriers, referred to as nanomedicines, show many therapeutic advantages over free drugs, but the inert carrier materials are the major component (generally more than 90%) in nanomedicines, causing low drug loading contents and thus excessive uses of parenteral excipients. Herein, we demonstrate a new concept directly using drug molecules to fabricate nanocarriers in order to minimize use of inert materials, substantially increase the drug loading content, and suppress premature burst release. Taking advantage of the strong hydrophobicity of the anticancer drug camptothecin (CPT), one or two CPT molecule(s) were conjugated to a very short oligomer chain of ethylene glycol (OEG), forming amphiphilic phospholipid-mimicking prodrugs, OEG-CPT or OEG-DiCPT. The prodrugs formed stable liposome-like nanocapsules with a CPT loading content as high as 40 or 58 wt % with no burst release in aqueous solution. OEG-DiCPT released CPT once inside cells, which showed high in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity. Meanwhile, the resulting nanocapsules can be loaded with a water-soluble drug-doxorubicin salt (DOX.HCl)-with a high loading efficiency. The DOX.HCl-loaded nanocapsules simultaneously delivered two anticancer drugs, leading to a synergetic cytotoxicity to cancer cells. The concept directly using drugs as part of a carrier is applicable to fabricating other highly efficient nanocarriers with a substantially reduced use of inert carrier materials and increased drug loading content without premature burst release."
" of global warming as a result of increased atomospheric CO2 concentration is becoming the most important environmental issue that the world faces today.[1] The capture and separation of CO2, especially CO2 from large point source, for example, fossil-fuel-fired electrical power–generation plants is critical to stabilize the atomospheric CO2 concentration.[2] The existing commercial CO2 capture facilities are based on the wet scrubbing process using aqueous alkanolamine solutions. It had disadvantages of energy intensive (i.e. high energy penalty), amine loss and degradation, release of volatile organic compounds, and equipment corrosion.[1] Recently, ionic liquids were proposed as non-volatile, and reversible absorbents for CO2 separation because CO2 is remarkably soluble in ionic liquids. However, the high viscosity limits their eventual use in large scale gas scrubbing applications.[3]"
