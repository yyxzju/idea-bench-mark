Further analysis shows that the nanoproperties needed in each step for a nanomedicine to maximize its efficiency are different and even opposing in different steps, particularly what the authors call the PEG, surface‐charge, size and stability dilemmas. To resolve those dilemmas in order to integrate all needed nanoproperties into one nanomedicine, stability, surface and size nanoproperty transitions (3S transitions for short) are proposed and the reported strategies to realize these transitions are comprehensively summarized.

Herein, we demonstrate a new concept directly using drug molecules to fabricate nanocarriers in order to minimize use of inert materials, substantially increase the drug loading content, and suppress premature burst release. Taking advantage of the strong hydrophobicity of the anticancer drug camptothecin (CPT), one or two CPT molecule(s) were conjugated to a very short oligomer chain of ethylene glycol (OEG), forming amphiphilic phospholipid-mimicking prodrugs, OEG-CPT or OEG-DiCPT. The prodrugs formed stable liposome-like nanocapsules with a CPT loading content as high as 40 or 58 wt % with no burst release in aqueous solution. OEG-DiCPT released CPT once inside cells, which showed high in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity. Meanwhile, the resulting nanocapsules can be loaded with a water-soluble drug-doxorubicin salt (DOX.HCl)-with a high loading efficiency. The DOX.HCl-loaded nanocapsules simultaneously delivered two anticancer drugs, leading to a synergetic cytotoxicity to cancer cells.

Near infrared (NIR) fluorescence-active fluorophores with excellent photostability are preferable for tracking drug release in vivo. Herein, we describe a NIR prodrug DCM-S-CPT and its polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid (PEG-PLA) loaded nanoparticles as a potent cancer therapy. We have conjugated a dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran derivative as the NIR fluorophore with camptothecin (CPT) as the anticancer drug using a disulfide linker. In vitro experiments verify that the high intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations in tumor cells cause cleavage of the disulfide linker, resulting in concomitantly the active drug CPT release and significant NIR fluorescence turn-on with large Stokes shift (200 nm). The NIR fluorescence of DCM-S-CPT at 665 nm with fast response to GSH can act as a direct off-on signal reporter for the GSH-activatable prodrug. Particularly, DCM-S-CPT possesses much better photostability than ICG, which is highly desirable for in situ fluorescence-tracking of cancer chemotherapy. DCM-S-CPT has been successfully utilized for in vivo and in situ tracking of drug release and cancer therapeutic efficacy in living animals by NIR fluorescence. DCM-S-CPT exhibits excellent tumor-activatable performance when intravenously injected into tumor-bearing nude mice, as well as specific cancer therapy with few side effects. DCM-S-CPT loaded in PEG-PLA nanoparticles shows even higher antitumor activity than free CPT, and is also retained longer in the plasma.

This filter is filled with a low-cost carbonaceous sorbent, such as activated carbon or charcoal, which has a high affinity (and, hence, high capacity) to CO2 but not to nitrogen (N2). This, in turn, leads to a high CO2/N2 selectivity, especially at low pressures. The Carbon Filter Process proposed in this work can recover at least 90% of flue-gas CO2 of 90%+ purity at a fraction of the cost normally associated with the conventional amine absorption process. The Carbon Filter Process requires neither expensive materials nor flue-gas compression or refrigeration, and it is easy to heat integrate with an existing or grassroots power plant without affecting the cost of the produced electricity too much. An abundant supply of low-cost CO2 from electricity producers is good news for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and enhanced coal-bed methane recovery (ECBMR) operators, because it will lead to higher o...",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f431ba9e3f1a299ba3c7a3ac8eaa5317e4ddd90b,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, either conventional cancer therapies or modern immunotherapies are non-tumor-targeted therapeutic approaches that cannot accurately distinguish malignant cells from healthy ones, giving rise to multiple undesired side effects. Recent advances in nanotechnology, accompanied by our growing understanding of cancer biology and nano-bio interactions, have led to the development of a series of nanocarriers, which aim to improve the therapeutic efficacy while reducing off-target toxicity of the encapsulated anticancer agents through tumor tissue-, cell-, or organelle-specific targeting. However, the vast majority of nanocarriers do not possess hierarchical targeting capability, and their therapeutic indices are often compromised by either poor tumor accumulation, inefficient cellular internalization, or inaccurate subcellular localization. This Review outlines current and prospective strategies in the design of tumor tissue-, cell-, and organelle-targeted cancer nanomedicines, and highlights the latest progress in hierarchical targeting technologies that can dynamically integrate these three different stages of static tumor targeting to maximize therapeutic outcomes.

Further understanding their in vivo behaviors, particularly how quickly and by what mechanism polymer micelles are cleared ( i. e., via micelles or unimers) once injected, is key to solving this dilemma. Herein, we hope to answer these questions for the clinically relevant polyethylene glycol- block-poly(ε-caprolactone) (PEG-PCL) and PEG- block-poly(d,l-lactide) (PEG-PDLLA) micelles. A small fraction of the hydrophobic chain ends was conjugated with a pair of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) dyes, Cy5 and Cy5.5, and used to fabricate FRET micelles whose FRET efficiency was correlated to the percentage of polymer chains in the micelles, the micelle degree. In vitro, serum proteins induced PEG-PCL micelle dissociation to some extent; mouse serum or blood surprisingly did not induce micelle dissociation but once with shear applied by a microfluidic channel caused most PEG-PCL micelles dissociated. After intravenous administration in mice, the PEG-PCL or PEG-PDLLA micelles were quickly sequestered into the liver as unimers, and the micelle degree in the blood quickly decreased to about 20%. The FRET-imaging experiments showed that in blood vessels the micelles quickly dissociated into unimers, which were found associated with albumin in blood and in liver. Thus, it is concluded that, upon intravenous injection, the shear and the bloodborne proteins (particularly albumin) induced the most (∼80%) PEG-PCL and PEG-PDLLA micelles to quickly dissociate into unimers, which were sequestered by Kupffer cells, while intact micelles were difficult to clear. These micelles were able to penetrate tumors and were very stable with cell membranes, but dissociated gradually inside cells. These findings on in vivo micelle fate and the clearance mechanism are directional for the rational design of polymer micelles for improved therapeutics; particularly, improving micelle stability in blood is the prerequisite for surface functionalizations such as introducing targeting ligands.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1d40226d2fd19b8afa29fb50aaeada81d37dfade,"It is concluded that, upon intravenous injection, the shear and the bloodborne proteins (particularly albumin) induced the most P EG-PCL and PEG-PDLLA micelles to quickly dissociate into unimers, which were sequestered by Kupffer cells, while intact micells were difficult to clear.",X.

However, stem cell treatment of SCI has been severely impaired by the increased generation of reactive oxygen species in the lesion microenvironment, which can lead to a high level of stem cell death and dysfunction. Herein, a MnO2 nanoparticle (NP)-dotted hydrogel is prepared through dispersion of MnO2 NPs in a PPFLMLLKGSTR peptide modified hyaluronic acid hydrogel. The peptide-modified hydrogel enables the adhesive growth of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and nerve tissue bridging. The MnO2 NPs alleviate the oxidative environment, thereby effectively improving the viability of MSCs. Transplantation of MSCs in the multifunctional gel generates a significant motor function restoration on a long-span rat spinal cord transection model and induces an in vivo integration as well as neural differentiation of the implanted MSCs, leading to a highly efficient regeneration of central nervous spinal cord tissue.

By coating them with optically transparent absorbing materials or devices, these large-sized solar panels could avoid detection by radar while maintaining highly efficient collection of solar energy. However, conventional microwave-absorbing materials/devices for solar panels suffer from bulky volume and fixed stealth performance that significantly hinders their practicality or multifunctionality. Particularly, dynamic modulation of microwave absorption for dual polarization remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose the design, fabrication, and characterization of an optically transparent and dynamically tunable microwave-absorbing metasurface that enables dual modulations (amplitude and frequency) independently for two orthogonal linearly polarized excitations. The tunability of the proposed metasurface is guaranteed by an elaborately designed anisotropic meta-atom composed of a patterned graphene structure whose electromagnetic responses for different polarizations can be dynamically and independently controlled via bias voltages. The dual tunability in such a graphene-based absorbing metasurface is experimentally measured, which agrees well with those numerical results. We further build an equivalent lumped circuit model to analyze the physical relation between the tunable sheet resistance of graphene and the polarization-independent modulations of the metasurface. Taking into account the advantages of optical transparency and flexibility, the proposed microwave-absorbing metasurface significantly enhances the multitasking stealth performance in complex scenarios and has the potential for advanced solar energy devices.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/44b40927618a7b0a7491c9a369e96c3e3116b2e8,,J.

Copper bromide/bromide based initiator systems polymerized BIMT very quickly with little control because of fast activation but slow deactivation. With copper chloride as the catalyst and trichloroacetate, CCl 4 , or ethyl a-chlorophenylacetate as the initiator, BIMT was polymerized at 60 °C in acetonitrile with first-order kinetics with respect to the monomer concentration. The molecular weight was linearly dependent on the conversion. The monomer concentration strongly affected the polymerization: a low monomer concentration caused the polymerization to be incomplete, probably because of catalyst disproportionation in polar solvents. The addition of a small amount of pyridine suppressed such disproportionation, but a further increase in the amount of pyridine greatly slowed the polymerization.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/25d95f2e1d2ff815b6c771472fbb9419f6b082e8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this problem, we demonstrate a dendrimer-camptothecin (CPT) conjugate that actively penetrates deep into PDA tumor through γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)-triggered cell endocytosis and transcytosis. The dendrimer-drug conjugate was synthesized by covalent attachment of CPT to polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive linker followed with surface modification with glutathione. Once the conjugate was delivered to the PDA tumor periphery, the overexpressed GGT on the vascular endothelial cell or tumor cell triggers the -glutamyl transfer reactions of glutathione to produce primary amines. The positively charged conjugate rapidly internalized via caveolae-mediated endocytosis and followed by vesicle-mediated transcytosis, augmenting its deep penetration within the tumor parenchyma and releasing active CPT throughout the tumor after cleavage by intracellular ROS. The dendrimer-drug conjugate exhibited high antitumor activity in multiple mice tumor models, including patient-derived PDA xenograft and orthotopic PDA cell xenograft, compared to the standard first-line chemotherapeutic drug (gemcitabine) for advanced pancreatic cancer.

Disulfide linkage-based prodrugs as well as their delivery systems have been studied extensively, but the WWH question in spatial and temporal (spatiotemporal) precision remains unanswered. Herein, we present a novel prodrug of camptothecin (CPT) linked to a near-infrared (NIR) cyanine dye via a disulfide linkage (Cy-S-CPT). The cleavage of the disulfide bond in Cy-S-CPT by endogenous glutathione (GSH) can activate the anti-cancer drug CPT and induce a remarkable fluorescence shift from 825 to 650 nm, thereby providing dual fluorescent channels to real-time track the prodrug biodistribution and activation in vivo. Impressively, the dual-channel NIR fluorescence bioimaging exhibits the pervasive drug distribution, i.e., the biodistribution of the intact prodrug was traced at the 825 nm-NIR fluorescence channel, whereas the activated drug was tracked at the 650 nm red fluorescence channel. In this way, we can overcome the blind spot in the metabolism kinetics of prodrugs in a certain organ or tissue.

Treatment strategies for SCI are required to overcome comprehensive issues. Implantation of biomaterial scaffolds and stem cells has been demonstrated to be a promising strategy. However, a comprehensive recovery effect is difficult to achieve. In the comprehensive treatment process, the specific roles of the implanted scaffolds and of stem cells in combined strategy are usually neglected. In this study, a peptide-modified scaffold is developed based on hyaluronic acid and an adhesive peptide PPFLMLLKGSTR. Synchrotron radiation micro computed tomography measurement provides insights to the three-dimensional inner topographical property and perspective porous structure of the scaffold. The modified scaffold significantly improves cellular survival and adhesive growth of mesenchymal stem cells during 3D culture in vitro. After implantation in transected spinal cord, the modified scaffold and mesenchymal stems are found to function in synergy to restore injured spinal cord tissue, with respective strengths. Hindlimb motor function scores exhibit the most significant impact of the composite implant at 2 weeks post injury, which is the time secondary injury factors begin to take hold. Investigation on the secondary injury factors including inflammatory response and astrocyte overactivity at 10 days post injury reveals the possible underlying reason. Implants of the scaffold, cells, and especially the combination of both elicit inhibitory effects on these adverse factors. The study develops a promising implant for spinal cord tissue engineering and reveals the roles of the scaffold and stem cells.

Their externally triggered shape-shifting behaviour offers on-demand controllability essential for many device applications. Ironically, accessing external triggers (for example, heating or light) under realistic scenarios has become the greatest bottleneck in demanding applications such as implantable medical devices8. Certain shape-shifting polymers rely on naturally present stimuli (for example, human body temperature for implantable devices)8 as triggers. Although they forgo the need for external stimulation, the ability to control recovery onset is also lost. Naturally triggered, yet actively controllable, shape-shifting behaviour is highly desirable but these two attributes are conflicting. Here we achieved this goal with a four-dimensional printable shape memory hydrogel that operates via phase separation, with its shape-shifting kinetics dominated by internal mass diffusion rather than by heat transport used for common shape memory polymers8-11. This hydrogel can undergo shape transformation at natural ambient temperature, critically with a recovery onset delay.

IL12‐based cancer gene therapy can overcome IL12's life‐threatening adverse effects, but its clinical translation has been limited by the lack of systemic gene‐delivery vectors capable of efficiently transfecting tumors to produce sufficient local IL12. Macrophages inherently excrete IL12, and tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) are the major tumor component taking up a large fraction of the vectors arriving in the tumor. It is thus hypothesized that a gene vector efficiently transfecting both cancer cells and TAMs would make the tumor to produce sufficient IL12; however, gene transfection of TAMs is challenging due to their inherent strong degradation ability. Herein, an IL12 gene‐delivery vector is designed that efficiently transfects both cancer cells and TAMs to make them as a factory for IL12 production, which efficiently activates anticancer immune responses and remodels the tumor microenvironment, for instance, increasing the M1/M2 ratio by more than fourfold.

A cationic polymer capable of converting to uncharged fragments once inside cells would not only quickly release the DNA, but also not interfere with the gene transcription process for efficient gene expression and low toxicity. A new class of polysulfoniums that can degrade into neutral thioether fragments triggered by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is reported. The polysulfoniums condense DNA into nanosized polyplexes, which can be quickly internalized and efficiently escape from endo/lysosomes. In cancer cells, the oxidation of the boronic acid/ester by the elevated ROS levels triggers polysulfonium to break down into neutral thioether fragments, efficiently releasing DNA for gene expression.

A kind of hydrophilic NIR fluorescent core–shell structured silica nanoparticle containing NIR cyanine chromophore, named as CyN-12@NHs, for in vivo bioimaging is developed through a facile one-pot strategy. The hydrophobic CyN-12 molecules can be successfully encapsulated into the core via the self-assembly of the amphiphilic block copolymer PS-b-PAA and subsequent shell cross-linking of silane. The as-prepared CyN-12@NHs exhibits typically spherical core–shell structure, which has a uniform size of 35 nm with a narrow size distribution, and excellent dispersity in aqueous solution. Moreover, NIR absorption (690 nm) and bright fluorescence (800 nm) of CyN-12@NHs with a large Stokes shift (110 nm) in aqueous system make it an amenable high quality bioimaging contrast agent. The core–shell nanostructure significantly enhances the chemical and photo-stability of CyN-12 via the encapsulation, which possesses a 50-times longer half-life period than free CyN-12, along with a better resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, in living cell imaging, CyN-12@NHs shows nearly no cytotoxicity and is able to outline the HepG2 cells. The in vivo imaging on a tumor-bearing mouse model indicates that CyN-12@NHs selectively accumulates in the liver after intravenous injection, and has a long retention in tumor after intra-tumor injection without decrease in fluorescence activity. Overall, the excellent photo-properties of CyN-12@NHs could meet the intricate requirements for tumor imaging, such as high sensitivity, sufficient tissue penetration, and high spatial resolution.

At low crosslinker levels, the polymerizations followed the first-order kinetics. However, when the crosslinker level was above 10 mol %, the ln([M] 0 /[M]) versus time curves showed deceleration at medium conversions because of the higher reactivity of EGDMA than that of DMAEMA. An acceleration at high conversions was also observed and probably caused by the diffusion limitations of catalyst/ligand complex in the polymer network. The hydrogels were characterized by swelling experiments, and the sol polymers were characterized by the size exclusion chromatographic technique to determine the number-average molecular weight and polydispersity.

CK19-positive HCCs are resistant to chemotherapies as well as local treatment. This subset of HCC is thought to derive from liver progenitor cells and can be induced by extracellular stimulation such as hypoxia. Besides being a stemness marker, CK19 plays an important role in promoting malignant property of HCC. The regulatory network associated with CK19 expression has been summarized that extracellular stimulations which transmit into cytoplasm through signal transduction pathways (TGF-β, MAKP/JNK and MEK-ERK1/2), further induce important nuclear transcriptional factors (SALL4, AP1, SP1) to activate CK19 promoter. Novel noncoding RNAs are also involved in the regulation of CK19 expression. TGFβR1 becomes a therapeutic target for CK19-positive HCC.

Catalysed by SG-CuBr/HMTETA and with vinyloxyethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate (VBIB) or allyl 2-bromoisobutyrate (ABIB) as initiator, the MMA polymerization showed first order kinetics up to a 60% monomer conversion. The polymerization rate slowed down at higher conversions due to a reduction in radical concentration. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results showed that the decrease in radical concentration was caused by the reaction of radicals with the initiator's vinyl or ally group moieties. In contrast, the DMAEMA polymerization was first order kinetics throughout the polymerization. The molecular weights of the resulting PMMA and polyDMAEMA increased linearly with conversion with low polydispersities. After the first run polymerization, the catalysts were recycled for second and thrid runs. The recycled catalysts still mediated a living polymerization of MMA or DMAEMA, producing polymers with controlled molecular weight and narrow polydispersity, but their catalytic activities decreased significantly. The reactivity reduction of the recycled catalyst was due to radical side reactions that yielded an extra amount of CuBr 2 as well as the catalyst loss during recycling.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/da8f9a120042ee37224282d8937781a759737cd1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the advantages of nonviral vectors, such as easily tailored structures, nonimmunogenetics, and relatively low cost, still drive great efforts to improve their transfection efficiencies. A reverse question asks if nonviral vectors with current gene transfection efficiency can find application niches. Herein, we synthesized a cationic polymer, poly{ N-[2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl]- N-[ p-acetyloxyphenyl]- N, N-diethylammonium chloride} (PQDEA), as a gene-delivery carrier and compared it side by side with chemotherapy drugs for cancer treatment. PQDEA is rapidly hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases into anionic poly(acrylic acid) to give low cytotoxicity and fast release of DNA for expression. PQDEA formed stable complexes with DNA (PQDEA/DNA polyplexes), which were further coated with a lipid layer to make serum-stable lipidic polyplexes, LPQDEA/DNAs, for in vivo use. In an intraperitoneal tumor xenograft model mimicking late-stage metastatic cervical cancer, the LPQDEA/DNA vector with TRAIL suicide gene exerted strong tumor inhibition as effective as paclitaxel, the first-line anticancer drug, but gave much less tumor relapse and much longer survival than the clinical chemotherapy drugs, irinotecan and paclitaxel.

Seeking for novel therapy strategies is an urgent need for those who no longer benefit from chemotherapy. Chemoresistance is usually associated with the dysfunction of intrinsic apoptosis. Targeting extrinsic apoptosis via TRAIL signaling and the death receptors could be a potential solution to treat chemoresistant cancer. A highly biocompatible nano system for codelivery of the TRAIL DNA and the death receptor sensitizer monensin was developed, in which low-molecular-weight PEI (LMW-PEI) was crosslinked by the sulfhydryl cyclodextrin via disulfide bonds, and then bound with DNA, thus forming the bioreducible polyplex cores. In addition, the cyclodextrin also functioned as a carrier for the hydrophobic monensin via host-guest inclusion. Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) was used to modify the polyplex core via charge interaction. The γ-PGA corona can specifically bind with the tumor-associated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) overexpressed on the tumor cells, and achieve tumor-targeting delivery. Moreover, the tumor-homing peptide RGD-modified γ-PGA was also prepared as the surface coating materials for further improving gene delivery efficiency. This gene delivery system was characterized by the dual ligand-targeting, dual stimuli-responsive features. The ligands of RGD and γ-PGA can target the tumor-associated receptors (i.e., integrin and GGT). The conformation of γ-PGA is pH-sensitive, and the tumor acidic micro environments could trigger the detachment of surface-coating γ-PGA. The disulfide crosslinking LMW-PEI is redox-sensitive, and its fast disassembling in the tumor cells could favor the efficient gene delivery. The anti-tumor efficacy was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, MYC-mediated synthetic lethality could be an important mechanism for overcoming the drug resistance.

Therefore, all the reported highly active copper-based catalysts are inactive in ATRP of VAc. Herein, we report the first copper-catalyst mediated ATRP of VAc using CuBr/2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine (tPy) or CuCl/tPy as catalysts.

Methods: In this study, we fabricated colloidal ultrastable nanomedicines from polymeric prodrugs and compared the therapeutic efficacies in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) CDX and clinically relevant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models, which closely mimic human tumor pathological properties. Working towards this goal, we esterified a highly potent SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) agent using oligo- or polylactide (oLA or PLA) segments with varying molecular weights. Results: The resulting SN38 conjugates assembled with polyethylene glycol-block-polylactic acid to form systemically injectable nanomedicines. With increasing PLA chain length, the SN38 conjugates showed extended retention in the nanoparticles and superior antitumor activity, completely eradicating xenografted tumors in both mouse models.

The present study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of YAP1 expression in human osteosarcoma (OS) and explore the molecular mechanisms of YAP1 activity in OS MG-63 cells. The expression of YAP1 was assessed by immunohistochemical assay using a tissue microarray procedure. A loss-of-function approach was used to investigate the effects of small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of YAP1 on the expression of RUNX2, CyclinD1, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) as well as the proliferative activities and invasive potential in OS MG-63 cells (evaluated by MTT and Transwell assays, respectively). The expression of YAP1 protein in OS tissues was significantly higher than that in ANCT, and was closely associated with gender (P = 0.013) and Enneking staging (P = 0.035), but it did not correlate with age, tumor location, or distant metastases of OS patients (P > 0.05, each). Knockdown of YAP1 resulted in downregulation of the expression of RUNX2, CyclinD1, and MMP-9 and inhibited the proliferation and invasion of MG-63 cells. Our findings suggest that YAP1 is highly expressed in OS tissues, and increased expression of this molecule is correlated with the gender and Enneking staging of osteosarcoma patients.

A series of biomineralized polymers and manganese dioxide hybrid nanoparticles (PMHNs) can be synthesized via the polymerization of various monomers, including dopamine (DA), epigallocatechin (EGC), pyrrole (PY), and diaminopyridine (DP), along with the reduction of KMnO4 and formation of manganese dioxide nanoparticles in albumin templates. These biomineralized PMHNs demonstrate ultrahigh MRI (longitudinal relaxivity up to 38 mM-1 s-1) and ultrasonic (US) imaging contrasting capabilities and have excellent photothermal therapy efficacy with complete ablation of orthotopic tumors. Moreover, these biomineralized hybrid nanoparticles can be effectively excreted through the kidneys, avoiding potential systemic toxicity.

Light rare earth chloride-propylene oxide systems are more effective for the copolymerization than heavy rare earth chloride-propylene oxide systems. For the rare earth chloride-epoxide catalyst system, epoxide is the requisite component, and its amount affects the catalytic activity; while rare earth isopropoxide can catalyze the copolymerization alone. The preparative conditions of the copolymer with NdCl3-5PO system were studied. The reactivity ratios of CL and TMC copolymerization with NdCl3-5PO determined by Fineman-Ross method are 1.60 for rTMC and 0.72 for rCL, respectively.

The slightly acidic microenvironment of wound tissues induces the charge removal of BSA chains, thus releasing the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) loaded through electrostatic action. Besides, the BSA chains in the gel network further endow their excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, also making them more suitable for bFGF loading.

It has been found that rare earth halides show high catalytic activities for the polymerization of TMC, but very low activities for that of CL polymerization. The copolymerization of CL and TMC can proceed only in the presence of high contents of TMC in the comonomer feed. The copolymerization rate decreases rapidly with increasing molar fraction of CL in the feed. The mechanism study by IR, 1H-, 13C-, and 31P-NMR spectra shows that the first step reaction of the polymerization of TMC or CL with rare earth halide is the complexation of monomer to the rare earth ion. The strong coordination of TMC to rare earth ion induces the ring-cleavage of TMC and generation of the cationic species, which initiate the polymerization of TMC via a cationic process. However, the polymerization of CL with rare earth halide is an “activated-hydrolysis” process, in which rare earth catalyst does not initiate the polymerization but serves as an activator of CL. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Cancer stemness is closely connected with resistance to sorafenib. Methods for reversing the cancer stemness remains one of the largest concerns in research and the lack of such methods obstructs current HCC therapeutics. Ubiquitin‐specific protease 22 (USP22) is reported to play a pivotal role in HCC stemness and multidrug resistance (MDR). Herein, a galactose‐decorated lipopolyplex (Gal‐SLP) is developed as an HCC‐targeting self‐activated cascade‐responsive nanoplatform to co‐delivery sorafenib and USP22 shRNA (shUSP22) for synergetic HCC therapy. Sorafenib, entrapped in the Gal‐SLPs, induced a reactive oxygen species (ROS) cascade and triggered rapid shUSP22 release. Thus, Gal‐SLPs dramatically suppressed the expression of USP22. The downregulation of USP22 suppresses multidrug resistance‐associated protein 1 (MRP1) to induce intracellular sorafenib accumulation and hampers glycolysis of HCC cells.

The resultant hybridization complexes, Raman-tagged GNPs/miR-141/Au@MNPs, are retrieved from solution by magnetic pull-down and concentrated within the focus of laser excitation.

One of the hurdles of this type of nanomedicine in real applications is the inherent complexity of their fabrication processes, which generally lack precise control over the sDDS structures and the batch-to-batch reproducibility. Furthermore, the classic 2D in vitro cell model, monolayer cell culture, has been used to evaluate sDDSs.

The solubility and the room temperature conductivity of PPy doped with mixed acid were measured as a function of component of CSA–DBSA mixed acid, and the structure of PPy was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), ultraviolet–visible (UV-vis) spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). PPy doped with DBSA–CSA mixed acid is soluble in m-cresol although PPy doped only by CSA is completely insoluble in any solvent. The solubility of PPy doped with mixed acid increases with an increase in the fraction of DBSA in the mixed acid, while the room temperature conductivity of the PPy increases with increasing CSA molar fraction. The UV-vis spectra and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements showed that both polaron and bipolaron are the charge carrier in the doped PPy with mixed acid. It was proposed that the contribution of CSA to the solubility of PPy doped with mixed acid is to decrease the interaction among PPy chains due to the large molecular size of CSA, while DBSA contributes to the solubility by its good solvating effect derived from its long alkyl chain.

The surface cationic lipids endowed the nanocarrier with improved serum stability, effective cellular uptake, and lysosomal evasion. The interior B-PDEAEA/DNA polyplexes, which were highly stable in the extracellular environment, but quickly dissociated, released DNA, promoted nuclei localization, and achieved efficient transcription.

In this paper, we present a general framework of incorporating the longitudinal (z) filtration in helical CT reconstruction, which leads to a new class of helical reconstruction algorithms with tunable performance characteristics to suit various applications. The z-filtering algorithm enables us to derive the performance curve of image noise or mA requirement versus the width of the section profile, whereas the existing helical reconstruction algorithms only represent limited discrete samples of the curve. We demonstrate that using a new helical reconstruction algorithm derived from this general framework, a substantial reduction in image noise or mA requirement can be achieved with a slight increase of FWHM of the section profile. Thus for many applications requiring both compact section profile and low image noise or mA requirement, the new algorithm represents a better tradeoff than both the 180 degrees and 360 degrees interpolation algorithms. The new algorithm also offers the following potential clinical benefits: (1) longer x-ray tube life; (2) longer scan duration with less x-ray tube cooling delays--longer volume coverage and/or longer thin-slice scan; (3) less radiation to patient; (4) less image noise; and (5) less helical artifacts.

Similar to other nanocarriers, most PBNs are designed to extravasate out of tumor vessels, depending on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, the EPR effect is compromised in some tumors due to the heterogeneity of tumor structures. Transvascular transport efficacy is decreased by complex blood vessels and condensed tumor stroma. The limited extravasation impedes efficient drug delivery into tumor parenchyma, and thus affects the subsequent tumor accumulation, which hinders the therapeutic effect of PBNs. Therefore, overcoming the biological barriers that restrict extravasation from tumor vessels is of great importance in PBN design. Many strategies have been developed to enhance the EPR effect that involve nanocarrier property regulation and tumor structure remodeling. Moreover, some researchers have proposed active transcytosis pathways that are complementary to the paracellular EPR effect to increase the transvascular extravasation efficiency of PBNs. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the design of PBNs with enhanced transvascular transport to enable optimization of PBNs in the extravasation of the drug delivery process.

Results: The high-concentration process (i.e., small reaction-volume) for mixture resulted in the large-sized PEI/DNA NPs that had a higher efficiency of gene transfection, compared to the small counterpart that was prepared at a low concentration. The microstructural experiments showed that the prepared small NPs were firmly condensed, whereas the large NPs were bulky and botryoid-shaped. The large NPs entered the tumor cells via the macropinocytosis pathway, and then efficiently dissociated in the cytoplasm and released DNA, thus promoting the intranuclear delivery. The enhanced in vivo therapeutic efficacy of the large NPs was demonstrated, indicating the promise for local-regional administration. Conclusion: This work provides better understanding of the effect of formulation process on nano-structural properties and gene transfection, laying a theoretical basis for rational design of the experimental process.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a3c531b035596e6b179c793b1a48c5532daaeca0,"Better understanding of the effect of formulation process on nano-structural properties and gene transfection is provided, laying a theoretical basis for rational design of the experimental process.",W.

In the absence of any adjuvants, NIR-irradiated STVN almost completely ablates primary tumors and simultaneously inhibits distant tumors in mice bearing bilateral melanoma. Meanwhile, the intratumorally injected STVN combined with NIR effectively suppressed melanoma lung metastasis as well as tumor recurrence, displaying that local STVN-mediated PTT could trigger a systemic anti-tumor immunity. Therefore, STVN, as a novel immunogenicity-enhanced PTA, affords a ""one stone two birds"" strategy for improved photothermia-induced cancer immunotherapy.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/deaa87edf185ab74922bf527951e56ce263eac99,"STVN, as a novel immunogenicity-enhanced PTA, affords a ""one stone two birds"" strategy for improved photothermia-induced cancer immunotherapy.",D.

For instance, the total fraction of aroma released from Lim@LaY over 30 days was about 10%, while the value was ∼20% for Lol@LaY.

Briefly, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-responsive peptide sequence is introduced between a therapeutic protein interferon (IFN) and a synthetic polypeptide P(EG3Glu)20.

Herein one of the most potent and selective BCRP inhibitors, Ko143, is encapsulated into a recently constructed prodrug PEG-S-S-SN38 displaying a high and fixed drug loading, multiple intratumoral stimuli (oxidative stress, GSH and esterase)-responsive drug release and significant in vitro and in vivo superiorities over CPT-11.

Through generating panels of human colorectal cancer models expressing altered levels of BCRP via lentiviral transfection and CRISPR-Cas9, characteristics of different drug formulations are carefully evaluated. Impressively, BI@PEG-SN38 nanoparticles effectively reverse chemoresistance to CPT-11 (resistance index dropping from ∼274.00-456.00 to ∼1.70-4.68) and PEG-S-S-SN38 (resistance index dropping from ∼5.83-14.00 to ∼1.70-4.68) in three BCRP-overexpressing cancer cell lines.

To date, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 14 gene therapy products. With the increasing interest in gene therapy, feasible gene delivery vectors are necessary for inserting new genes into cells. There are different kinds of gene delivery vectors including viral vectors like lentivirus, adenovirus, retrovirus, adeno-associated virus et al, and non-viral vectors like naked DNA, lipid vectors, polymer nanoparticles, exosomes et al, with viruses being the most commonly used. Among them, the most concerned vector is adeno-associated virus (AAV) because of its safety, natural ability to efficiently deliver gene into cells and sustained transgene expression in multiple tissues. In addition, the AAV genome can be engineered to generate recombinant AAV (rAAV) containing transgene sequences of interest and has been proven to be a safe gene vector. Recently, rAAV vectors have been approved for the treatment of various rare diseases. Despite these approvals, some major limitations of rAAV remain, namely nonspecific tissue targeting and host immune response. Additional problems include neutralizing antibodies that block transgene delivery, a finite transgene packaging capacity, high viral titer used for per dose and high cost. To deal with these challenges, several techniques have been developed. Based on differences in engineering methods, this review proposes three strategies: gene engineering-based capsid modification (capsid modification), capsid surface tethering through chemical conjugation (surface tethering), and other formulations loaded with AAV (virus load). In addition, the major advantages and limitations encountered in rAAV engineering strategies are summarized.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba610b62fe24a3a788c6e3abf536b6d3d13533eb,"This review compares side-by-side how viral/nonviral gene vectors transcend these biological barriers in terms of blood circulation, cellular uptake, endosome escape, nucleus import and gene transcription.",X.

A consequent elevation in interstitial plasmin activates collagenases and cleaves tumor necrosis factor alpha from its anchors on endothelium. Collagen fibril degradation and cellular death at the apex of the preovulatory follicle are hallmarks of impending ovulation. Follicular contractions rupture the weakened fabric at the apex, and the ovum, which has been disconnected from the underlying granulosa, is expelled; these components of the cascade are prostaglandin-mediated. Ovulation is required for fertility; unfortunately, it imparts a cancer risk to the ovarian surface epithelium. DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species are generated by inflammatory cells attracted into the vicinity of the ovulatory stigma. An ischemia-reperfusion flux coincident with ovulation and wound repair also contributes to genotoxicity. Potentially mutagenic lesions in DNA are normally reconciled by TP53 tumor suppressor-dependent cell-cycle arrest and base excision repair mechanisms; it is a unifocal escape that could be problematic.

However, little is known about the correlation between the carrier's charge density and its AMT-induced tumor infiltration efficiency. Herein, we investigate the effect of the cationic polymer's charge on the AMT-induced tumor penetration ability using in vitro multilayer tumor spheroids (MTSs). A cationic polymer, polyethylenimine (PEI), is amidized with acetic anhydride to obtain acetylated PEIs (AcPEIs) with different cationic charge densities. As the amidization ratio increases, the AcPEIs' cytotoxicity, zeta potential, and cell-binding affinity significantly decrease. Notably, not only does the weak cell binding (AcPEIs with high acetylation degrees) lead to slow endocytosis and inefficient transcytosis, so does the strong cell-binding PEI. The PEI with 24% acetylation (AcPEI24%) is found to have the highest transcytosis efficiency because its balanced cell-binding affinity triggers fast adsorption-mediated endocytosis. The subsequent Golgi apparatus/endoplasmic reticulum-mediated exocytosis via extracellular vesicles leads to highly effective transcellular delivery and tumor penetration in MTSs. Therefore, the drug carrier's surface cationic charge density critically influences its AMT-induced tumor penetration efficiency. This study provides mechanistic insights into the design of drug-delivery systems with active transcytosis for improved tumor penetration and enhanced therapeutic efficiency.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/214d7edf3d39d6a038528f1ba62e4340108af35f,Mechanistic insights are provided into the design of drug-delivery systems with active transcytosis for improved tumor penetration and enhanced therapeutic efficiency because the drug carrier's surface cationic charge density critically influences its AMT-induced tumor penetration efficiency.,S.

The nanoprobe is built on the merits of ultraviolet-visible light of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) excited by near-infrared (NIR) and extraordinary loading capability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for drug delivery. Controlled release of doxorubicin (DOX) from the nanoprobe by miR-21 underwent the following two-stage kinetics: a fast release stage specifically triggered by miR-21 and proportional to miR-21 concentration and a slow stage observed in both gated and ungated nanoprobes due to collapse of the UIO-66-NH2 coatings via ligand exchange with phosphates. In addition, the nanoprobe showed good selectivity, a linear response towards miR-21 ranging from 4 nM to 500 nM, and a limit of detection in 4 nM, which precluded unintended payload leakage due to low-abundance endogenous miR-21 expression in normal cells. Moreover, based on a dual-targeted delivery system constituted by AS1411-mediated recognition and responsive release of DOX, a specific cytotoxic efficacy was observed in MCF-7 cells.

The DCA could remarkably enhance the MRI of metastasized tumors in the liver, because it could simultaneously reduce the background signal in the liver by avoiding uptake by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells through the zwitterionization and increase the signal in tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Moreover, in contrast to non-biodegradable DCA, this DCA showed minimal long-term Gd3+ retention in all organs and tissues because it could be degraded into small fragments.

Solid tumors have a weakly acidic extracellular pH (pH < 7), and cancer cells have even more acidic pH in endosomes and lysosomes (pH 4-6). The pH-gradients in tumor can be explored for tumor targeting and drug release in cancer drug delivery by applying pH-responsive polymeric micelles. The pH-responsive polymeric micelles consist of a corona and a core, and are made of amphiphilic copolymers, in which there are pH-responsive polymeric blocks. Two types of pH-responsive polymers-protonizable polymers and acid-labile polymers have been mainly used to make pH-responsive micelles for drug delivery. The protonizable polymers are polybases or polyacids, and their water-soluble/insoluble or charge states undergo changes with the protonation or deprotonation stimulated by external acidity, while the acid-labile polymers change their physical properties by chemical reaction stimulated by the acidity. Polymeric micelles whose core or coronas respond to the tumor extracellular acidity can be explored for triggering the fast release of the carried drug, activating the targeting group and accelerating the endocytosis of drug-loaded polymeric micelles, and those whose core or coronas respond to the tumor lysosomal acidity can be used for facilitating their escape from the lysosomes and targeting the nucleus.

However, there is no specific therapeutic option for CK19+ HCC. The correlation between tumor recurrence and expression status of CK19 were studied in 206 patients undergoing liver transplantation for HCC. CK19-/+ HCC cells were isolated to screen effective antitumor drugs. The therapeutic effects of regorafenib were evaluated in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from 10 HCC patients. The mechanism of regorafenib on CK19+ HCC was investigated. CK19 positiveness indicated aggressiveness of tumor and higher recurrence risk of HCC after liver transplantation. The isolated CK19+ HCC cells had more aggressive behaviors than CK19- cells. Regorafenib preferentially increased the growth inhibition and apoptosis of CK19+ cells in vitro, whereas sorafenib, apatinib, and 5-fluorouracil did not. In PDX models from CK19-/+ HCC patients, the tumor control rate of regorafenib achieved 80% for CK19+ HCCs, whereas 0% for CK19- HCCs. RNA-sequencing revealed that CK19+ cells had elevated expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, which are essential for mitochondrial function. Further experiments confirmed that regorafenib attenuated the mitochondrial respiratory capacity in CK19+ cells. However, the mitochondrial respiration in CK19- cells were faint and hardly repressed by regorafenib. The mitochondrial respiration was regulated by the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which was inhibited by regorafenib in CK19+ cells.

Cytotoxicity analysis, cellular antioxidant activity assay, and a pharmacokinetic study were performed to evaluate the biological properties of these two formulations. The final weight ratios of both hesperetin to TPGS and hesperetin to PC were 1:12 based on their water solubility, which increased to 21.5- and 20.7-fold, respectively.

Two ionic liquid monomers, 1-(4-vinylbenzyl)-3-butyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (VBIT) and 1-(4-vinylbenzyl)-3- butyl imidazolium hexafluorophosphate (VBIH), were synthesized through the quaternization of N-butylimidazole with 4-vinylbenzylchloride and a subsequent anion- exchange reaction with sodium tetrafluoroborate or potassium hexafluorophosphate. Copper-mediated atom transfer radical polymerization was used to polymerize VBIT and VBIH. The effects of various initiator/catalyst systems, monomer concentrations, solvent polarities, and reaction temperatures on the polymerization were examined. The polymerization was well controlled and exhibited living characteristics when CuBr/1,1,4,7,10,10-hexamethyltriethylenetetramine or CuBr/2,2′-bipyridine was used as the catalyst and ethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate was used as the initiator. Characterizations by thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction showed that the resulting VBIT polymer, poly[1-(4-vinylbenzyl)-3-butyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate] (PVBIT), was amorphous and had excellent thermal stability, with a glass-transition temperature of 84 °C.

As a cytosolic double stranded DNA (dsDNA) sensor, cGAS can bind with relatively long dsDNA, resulting in conformational change and activation of cGAS. Activated cGAS catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) into cGAMP, a cyclic dinucleotide (CDN). CDNs, including 2'3'-cGAMP, stimulate adapter protein STING on the endoplasmic membrane, triggering interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation. This results in antitumor and antiviral type I interferon (IFN-I) responses. Moreover, cGAS-STING overactivation and the resulting IFN-I responses have been associated with a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. This makes cGAS-STING appealing immunomodulatory targets for the prophylaxis and therapy of various related diseases. However, drug development of CDNs and CDN derivatives is challenged by their limited biostability, difficult formulation, poor pharmacokinetics, and inefficient tissue accumulation and cytosolic delivery. Though recent synthetic small molecular CDN- or non-CDN-based STING agonists have been reported with promising preclinical therapeutic efficacy, their therapeutic efficacy and safety remain to be fully evaluated preclinically and clinically. Therefore, it is highly desirable and clinically significant to advance drug development for cGAS-STING activation by innovative approaches, such as drug delivery systems and drug development for pharmacological immunomodulation of cGAS. In this Account, we summarize our recent research in the engineering and delivery of immunostimulatory or immunoregulatory modulators for cGAS and STING for the immunotherapy of cancer and autoimmune diseases. To improve the delivery efficiency of CDNs, we developed ionizable and pH-responsive polymeric nanocarriers to load STING agonists, aiming to improve the cellular uptake and facilitate the endosomal escape to induce efficient STING activation. We also codelivered STING agonists with complementary immunostimulatants in nanoparticle-in-hydrogel composites to synergetically elicit potent innate and adaptive antitumor responses that eradicate local and distant large tumors. Further, taking advantage of the simplicity of manufacturing and the established nucleic acid delivery system, we developed oligonucleotide-based cGAS agonists as immunostimulant immunotherapeutics as well as adjuvants for peptide antigens for cancer immunotherapy. To suppress the overly strong proinflammatory responses associated with cGAS-STING overactivation in some of the autoimmune disorders, we devised nanomedicine-in-hydrogel (NiH) that codelivers a cGAS inhibitor and cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-scavenging cationic nanoparticles (cNPs) for systemic immunosuppression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapy. Lastly, we discussed current drug development by targeting cGAS-STING for cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases, as well as the potential opportunities for utilizing cGAS-STING pathway for versatile applications in disease treatment.",,,S.

Here, we find that the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the topoisomerase I inhibitor 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38) exhibit synergistic effects when the molar ratio reaches 5:1. We further develop a glutathione-responsive self-assembled combination nanoparticle (Combo NP) to integrate individual HCQ and SN38 polymeric prodrugs at the optimized ratio. In TNBC cells treated with Combo NP, HCQ-mediated autophagy blockage significantly enhances the DNA damage and apoptotic effect of SN38, manifesting synergistically cytotoxic effects of Combo NP. In vivo evaluations show that Combo NP maintains the molar ratio of HCQ to SN38 within the synergistic range in mouse blood circulation and intratumoral tissues. More importantly, Combo NP elicits superior therapeutic benefit in metastatic TNBC models, compared to free drug combination as well as single drug nanoparticles.

The BPED ligand was found to significantly promote the activation reaction: the CuBr/BPED complex reacted with the initiators so fast that a large amount of Cu(II)Br 2 /BPED was produced and thus the polymerizations were slow for all the monomers. The reaction of CuCl/BPED with the initiator was also fast, but by reducing the catalyst concentration or adding CuCl 2 , the activation reaction could be slowed to establish the equilibrium of ATRP for a well-controlled living polymerization of MA. CuCl/BPED was found very active for the polymerization of MA. For example, 10 mol% of the catalyst relatively to the initiator was sufficient to mediate a living polymerization of MA. The CuCl/BPED, however, could not catalyze a living polymerization of MMA because the resulting CuCl 2 /BPED could not deactivate the growing radicals. The effects of the ligand structures on the catalysis of ATRP are also discussed.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/82c39b183a1768b3d9fb02b78ded80bec7fb0437,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nanocarrier is loaded with metformin and catalase, and the polymer is linked to the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6). Metformin inhibits the mitochondrial respiration of cancer cells, reducing the activity of cancer cells and increasing the oxygen concentration required for photodynamic therapy. Not only the effect of photodynamic therapy is enhanced, but also the effect of chemotherapy is increased to achieve super additive treatment. These RNs exhibit not only low cytotoxicity but also high biocompatibility in vitro experiments. In vitro Ce6 release studies have shown a higher release in the presence of glutathione (GSH).

The dual‐mode peptide targeting design is realized by co‐assembly of tumor targeting and nuclei‐localizing peptide‐CPT prodrugs, rendering the nanoassemblies with efficient cancer cell‐selective capability.

The peptide‐CPT prodrugs release up to 68% CPT in 1 h in the presence of HDACs, while no detectable CPT release is observed in the absence of HDACs at the same time. The peptide‐CPT prodrugs selectively kill cancer cells with high HDACs levels. The dual targeting peptide‐CPT nanoassemblies exhibit extended blood circulation, excellent tumor accumulation, and potent antitumor activity by inhibiting tumor progression and metastasis in mice bearing 4T1 aggressive breast tumors.

However, the therapy-induced proliferative burst, which always accompanies drug resistance and metastasis, has become a major obstacle during treatment. Except for some endogenous cellular or genetic mechanisms and some microenvironmental selection pressures, the intercellular connections in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are also thought to be the driving force for the acquired drug resistance and proliferative burst. Even though some pathway inhibitors or cell exempting strategies could be applied to partially avoid these unwanted communications, the complexity of the TME and the limited knowledge about those unknown detrimental connections might greatly compromise the efforts. Therefore, a more broad-spectrum strategy is urgently needed to relieve the drug-induced burst proliferation during various treatments. In this article, based on the possible discrepancies in metabolic activity between cells with different growth rates, several ester-bond-based prodrugs were synthesized. After screening, 7-ethyl-10-hyodroxycamptothecin-based prodrug nanoparticles were found to efficiently overcome the paclitaxel resistance, to selectively act on the malignantly proliferated drug-resistant cells and, furthermore, to greatly diminish the proliferative effect of common cytotoxic agents by blocking the detrimental intercellular connections. With the discriminating ability against malignant proliferating cells, the as-prepared prodrug nanomedicine exhibited significant anticancer efficacy against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tumor models, either by itself or by combining with highly potent nonselective chemotherapeutics.

Currently, either conventional cancer therapies or modern immunotherapies are non-tumor-targeted therapeutic approaches that cannot accurately distinguish malignant cells from healthy ones, giving rise to multiple undesired side effects. Recent advances in nanotechnology, accompanied by our growing understanding of cancer biology and nano-bio interactions, have led to the development of a series of nanocarriers, which aim to improve the therapeutic efficacy while reducing off-target toxicity of the encapsulated anticancer agents through tumor tissue-, cell-, or organelle-specific targeting. However, the vast majority of nanocarriers do not possess hierarchical targeting capability, and their therapeutic indices are often compromised by either poor tumor accumulation, inefficient cellular internalization, or inaccurate subcellular localization. This Review outlines current and prospective strategies in the design of tumor tissue-, cell-, and organelle-targeted cancer nanomedicines, and highlights the latest progress in hierarchical targeting technologies that can dynamically integrate these three different stages of static tumor targeting to maximize therapeutic outcomes.

However, the clinical application of doxorubicin has been largely limited by its irreversible cardiotoxicity, which is mainly induced by the primary amine group. In this study, we structurally modified doxorubicin by converting the primary amine into an acid-labile amide before assessing the acute cardiac effect of doxorubicin (pristine or modified) on cardiomyocyte contractile function. Contractile properties of murine cardiomyocytes were analyzed including peak shortening (PS), time-to-PS (TPS), time-to-90% relengthening (TR(90)) and maximal velocity of shortening/re-lengthening (+/-dL/dt). Cell toxicity and survival rate were evaluated using the MTT assay. The doxorubicin-free base was amidized by reacting with 3,4,5,6-tetrahydophthalic anhydride (THPA) or 3,3,4,4-tetramethylsuccinic anhydride (TMSA) to yield doxorubicin-THPA or -TMSA. Acute exposure of pristine doxorubicin (10(-9)-10(-5)M) for 30 min significantly prolonged TPS and TR(90) without affecting PS and +/-dL/dt. Interestingly, doxorubicin-induced prolongation of TPS and TR(90) was significantly attenuated or abrogated by amidization of doxorubicin. Neither doxorubicin-THPA nor -TMSA affected PS and +/-dL/dt. ROS and MTT assay revealed significantly reduced ROS production and cardiac cell toxicity from amidized doxorubicin compared with the pristine compound.

A promising approach to addressing problems in anticancer drug solubility and selectivity is their conjugation with polymeric carriers to form polymer-based prodrugs. These polymer-based prodrugs are macromolecular carriers, designed to increase the aqueous solubility of antitumor drugs, can enhance bioavailability. Additionally, polymer-based prodrugs approach exploits unique features of tumor physiology to passively facilitate intratumoral accumulation, and so improve chemodrug pharmacokinetics and pharmacological properties. This review introduces basic concepts of polymer-based prodrugs, provides an overview of currently emerging synthetic, natural, and genetically engineered polymers that now deliver anticancer drugs in preclinical or clinical trials, and highlights their major anticipated applications in anticancer therapies.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/24a24af550ac884c6b01e14705a58c188d122a79,The prodrug strategy is one of the most commonly used chemical/biochemical strategies towards improving the therapeutic index of anticancer drugs.,S.

However, these therapies can hardly adapt to immunologically “cold” tumors featuring insufficient and exhausted tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes as well as low immunogenicity. Herein, a two‐pronged strategy is presented by combining cryo‐shocked M1 macrophages (CSMs) and CD47‐targeted lonidamine nanodrugs (CLNDN) for reprograming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). CSMs induce durable polarization of tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) into the immunostimulatory M1 phenotype through the TLR2/MAPK signaling and also elevate CD47 expression in tumor cells, which in turn facilitates the targeted delivery of CLNDN into tumor cells. CLNDN trigger tumor cell‐specific pyroptosis through the caspase‐3/GSDME pathway and lead to the release of damage‐associated molecular patterns. Consequently, the combination of CSM and CLNDN synergistically boosts immune infiltration and tumor cell immunogenicity within the TME, effectively reverting tumor immunosuppression. This combination achieves potent antitumor effects and induces long‐term immune memory against tumor metastasis and recurrence. This work demonstrates for the first time TAM polarization by using cryo‐shocked macrophages and highlights its coordination with tumor pyroptosis for igniting tumor immunity, opening up a new avenue for robust cancer immunotherapy.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/17d13f38ae5dede37ba36c02d13f6cac79f8620d,"This work demonstrates for the first time TAM polarization by using cryo‐shocked macrophages and highlights its coordination with tumor pyroptosis for igniting tumor immunity, opening up a new avenue for robust cancer immunotherapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

NC-NP remains stable under normal physiological conditions but quickly releases 1,2-diaminocyclohexane-platinum(II) (DACHPt, a parent drug of oxaliplatin) and NCTD in response to the tumor acidity. NCTD inhibits protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity to relieve cell cycle arrest and downregulates the tumor PD-L1 expression to disrupt the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 interaction, synergistically enhancing Pt-based chemotherapy and immunogenic cell death-induced immunotherapy. As a result, NC-NP exhibits potent synergistic cytotoxicity and promotes T cell recruitment to generate robust antitumor immune responses. The dual synergism exhibits potent antitumor activity against orthotopic 4T1 tumors, providing a promising chemo-immunotherapy paradigm for cancer treatment.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66b8c4c7871937560ff73182e033eae44868b51d,Norcantharidin‐platinum codelivery nanoparticles (NC‐NP) with tumor‐sensitive release profiles are designed to overcome the self‐defense mechanisms via synergistic chemo‐immunotherapy and exhibits potent synergistic cytotoxicity and promotes T cell recruitment to generate robust antitumor immune responses.,J.

The MRI and fluorescence imaging show that sixth-generation nanodots with acetylated (G6-Ac) and oligo ethylene glycol (G6-OEG) surfaces exhibit similar high tumor accumulation but different intratumor distribution. Cellular uptake and transport experiments suggest that G6-Ac nanodots have lower lysosomal entrapment (61% vs. 83%) and a higher exocytotic rate (47% vs. 29%) than G6-OEG. Therefore, G6-Ac is more likely to undergo intercellular transport through cell transcytosis, and is able to reach a tumor area distant from blood vessels, while G6-OEG mainly enters the tumor through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect-based passive transport, and is not able to deliver to distant tumor areas.

However, the rational design of transcytosis-inducing nanomedicines remains challenging. We recently demonstrated that the γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)-responsive polymer cationization induced efficient adsorption-mediated transcytosis (AMT). However, it remains unclear how the nanomedicines' physicochemical properties influence the GGT-responsive cationization and induced transcytosis behaviors. Herein, through a combination of experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find that the random copolymers with high hydrophobic monomers tend to form compact structures accessible to the catalytic site of GGT, leading to a fast cationization and thus high transcytosis efficiency, while the homopolymers of the hydrophilic GGT-sensitive monomers have elongated structures unable to enter the active site and thus exhibit poor GGT sensitivity. As a result, the more hydrophobic polymer-drug conjugates with high camptothecin contents exhibit higher GGT-responsive activity, which in turn leads to faster cationization and cellular internalization, enhanced tumor infiltration, and more potent antitumor activity. These findings indicate the hydrophobicity is a main parameter determining the GGT catalytic activity and transcytosis efficiency of the GGT-activatable co(homo)polymers, providing guidelines for the rational design of GGT-induced charge reversal carriers for transcytotic nanomedicines.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cae2a3602410ee0b8a3039877d5a7f2ab0ea0d88,"It is found that the random copolymers with high hydrophobic monomers tend to form compact structures accessible to the catalytic site of GGT, leading to a fast cationization and thus high transcytosis efficiency, while the homopolymers of the hydrophilic GGT-sensitive monomers have elongated structures unable to enter the active site and thus exhibit poor GGT sensitivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Curc-OEG formed stable nanoparticles in aqueous conditions and served two roles--as an anticancer prodrug and a drug carrier. As an anticancer prodrug, the formed nanoparticles had a high and fixed curcumin-loading content of 25.3 wt%, and released active curcumin in the intracellular environment. Curc-OEG had high inhibition ability to several cancer cell lines due to apoptosis. Intravenously injected Curc-OEG significantly reduced the tumor weights and tumor numbers in the athymic mice xenografted with intraperitoneal SKOV-3 tumors and subcutaneous (mammary fat pad) MDA-MB-468 tumors. Preliminary systemic toxicity studies found that Curc-OEG did not cause acute and subchronic toxicities to mouse visceral organs at high doses. As drug carriers, Curc-OEG nanoparticles could carry other anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin and camptothecin, and ship them into drug-resistant cells, greatly enhancing the cytotoxicity of the loaded drug.

Membrane technique in particular pervaporation offers a number of potential advantages over conventional FCC gasoline desulfurization processes. The present study focuses on the performance enhancement of PDMS membrane by incorporating silica nanoparticles. Specifically, silica nanoparticles formed by the catalysis and templating of protamine in w/o reverse microemulsion are in situ embedded into PDMS bulk matrix, endowing the resultant oleophilic nanocomposite membranes with appropriate free volume properties and superior separation performance. Through the rational manipulation of biomimetic mineralization at water-oil interface, silica particles with uniform size are acquired. Following this protocol, by introducing organic PDMS oligomers into the oil phase, PDMS-SiO(2) nanocomposite membranes are prepared in a facile way. The resultant nanocomposite membranes display superior permeability and permselectivity in the pervaporative desulfurization using thiophene/n-octane binary mixture as model gasoline, for example, under the condition of 500 ppm sulfur in feed (40 L/h) at 30°C, an enrichment factor of 4.83-5.82 with a normalized permeation rate of 6.61-10.76 × 10(-5)kgm/m(2)h is acquired.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aa64e2b93b11ff3a987cb1f21b7fa0953a2ce209,,B.

However, because of tumor heterogeneity, current nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems rarely improve clinical outcomes significantly, commonly only reducing systemic toxicity. In this work, a new tumor-specific, tyrosinase-responsive cascade amplification release nanoparticle (TR-CARN) was developed to fulfill the needs for tumor-specific drug delivery and high efficacy cancer treatment. Tyrosinase (Tyr) is specifically expressed in melanomas and can catalyze acetaminophen (APAP) to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS). It was therefore utilized here to initiate the ROS amplification procedure. In TR-CARN, a ROS-responsive prodrug BDOX was loaded into an amphiphilic polymer, and APAP was linked to the polymer through a ROS-cleavable thioether bond. TR-CARN caused reduced side effects during the delivery because of the low toxicity of BDOX. Once TR-CARN entered into the tumor, endogenous ROS triggered initial APAP and BDOX release. Tyr-mediated ROS synthesis by APAP then accelerated APAP and BDOX release and toxification. Consequently, TR-CARN achieved melanoma-specific treatment of high efficacy through the cascade amplification strategy with enhanced biosafety.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1972033861d6886484bd3de8f83da1881efb0323,"Tumor-specific, tyrosinase-responsive cascade amplification release nanoparticle (TR-CARN) was developed to fulfill the needs for tumor-specific drug delivery and high efficacy cancer treatment and achieved melanoma-specific treatment of high efficacy through the cascade amplification strategy with enhanced biosafety.",D.

Herein, a multifunctional Mn, N, and S incorporated carbon dots (MnNS:CDs) nanoenzyme exhibiting scavenging activity against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), photoluminescence quantum yield of 17.7%, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast was explored. The optical, magnetic, and antioxidant properties of MnNS:CDs were then regulated by control over Mn incorporation to achieve higher photostability and antioxidant properties. Furthermore, conjugation of MnNS:CDs with hyaluronic acid (HA) (denoted as MnNS:CDs@HA) endowed them with high biocompatibility, which is validated by in vivo studies on zebrafish, and the ability to specifically target cluster determinant 44 (CD44)-overexpressing B16F1 cells, as verified by in vitro confocal and MRI studies. The MnNS:CDs@HA probe with therapeutic antioxidant and dual-modal imaging capability was further assessed for non-covalent binding of doxorubicin (DOX) as a model chemotherapeutic cancer drug. Results showed that targeted delivery and pH-dependent release of DOX elicited apparent cell toxicity (90%) toward B16F1 cancer cells when compared to free DOX treatment group (60%). Benefiting from their intrinsic antioxidant properties, and dual-modal imaging ability, the MnNS:CDs@HA nanocarrier is projected to improve non-invasive targeted diagnosis and therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Carbon dots (CDs) have gained increasing interest as emerging and promising artificial functional nanomaterials that mimic the structures and functions of natural enzymes. In this work, Mn, N, and S incorporated CDs (MnNS:CDs) were synthesized using a one-pot microwave hydrothermal method to serve as fluorescent and magnetic resonance imaging probes, and catalase mimics in the reduction of the oxidative-stress related damage. Further conjugation of the probes with hyaluronic acid endows them with a good in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility as well as the capability to selectively target CD44-overexpressing cancer cells, as investigated by in vitro fluorescence, and magnetic resonance imaging. The dual-modal nanoprobe was then used to carry on doxorubicin through a non-covalent association. Favorably, targeted delivery, and pH-responsive release of doxorubicin enhanced cell killing efficiency by 50% as opposed to the free doxorubicin treatment group. The presented theranostic heteroatom doped CDs hold great promise for dual-modal imaging enabling accurate diagnosis coupled with therapeutic effect through free radical scavenging and chemotherapy.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/da23576c9b92f662260b5784338ea70d65e3297d,A potential multi-functional nanocarrier system was successfully built that enabled the R-CD@mPEG-CHO to have pH responsive ability in tumor microenvironment and achieved controlled drug release.,K.

Derivatization with functional molecules or preparation as bridging dimers are the two main modifications for β-CD to obtain chiral recognition compounds. Herein, a partially derived bridged β-CD (CPI-EBCD) bonded chiral stationary phases was prepared to improve enantioseparation. The chiral recognition moiety was synthesized by a bridged β-cyclodextrin dimer using a short-chain bridging agent (ethylenediamine) and then modifying the bridged cyclodextrin with a 4-chlorophenylisocyanate (CPI) containing a benzene ring and polar group. Compared with natural β-CD, dual-chambered CPI-EBCDs have better encapsulation synergies and more recognition sites with the guest molecule, while the short flexible bridging groups make the double cavities closer and more easily recognizable as linear molecules. The introduction of derived groups CPI provided more recognition sites and more types of interactions, including π-π interaction force, hydrogen bonding effect, and dipole-dipole interaction, thus improving the enantiomer-specific chirality recognition effect. The chiral stationary phase CPI-EBCDP was obtained by connecting CPI-EDCB with mesoporous silica microspheres by simple photochemical reaction using a green non-toxic diazo resin as coupling agent, simplifying preparation process. In the reversed phase mode of liquid chromatography, CPI-EBCDP has excellent chiral recognition ability, and 12 chiral compounds are successfully isolated by optimizing mobile phase conditions, with good reproducibility and stability. The successful preparation of this new chiral stationary phase provides an important reference for the subsequent development of cyclodextrin-like chiral stationary phases.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fafc85eba963124fb936ffefa4bc4d9f5a163b8f,,X.

Aggressive cytoreductive surgery (CRS) is the primary treatment for peritoneal metastasis. Unfortunately, this intensive treatment frequently causes clinical complications, such as postoperative recurrence, metastasis, and adhesion formation. Emerging evidence suggest that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released by inflammatory neutrophils contribute to these complications. Effective NET-targeting strategies thus show considerable potential in counteracting these complications but remain challenging. Here, we synthesized and screened one type of sulfoxide-containing homopolymer, PMeSEA, with potent fouling-resistant and NET-inhibiting capabilities. Hydrating sulfoxide groups endow PMeSEA with superior non-fouling ability, significantly inhibiting protein/cell adhesion. Besides, the polysulfoxides can be selectively oxidized by ClO- which is required to stabilize the NETs rather than H2O2, and ClO- scavenging effectively inhibits NETs formation without disturbing redox homeostasis in tumor cells and quiescent neutrophils. As a result, PMeSEA potently prevents postoperative adhesions, significantly suppresses peritoneal metastasis, and shows synergetic antitumor activity with chemotherapeutic 5-Fluorouracil. Moreover, coupling aggressive cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with PMeSEA potently inhibits CRS-induced tumor metastatic relapse and postoperative adhesions. Notably, PMeSEA exhibits low in vivo acute and subacute toxicities, implying significant potential for clinical postoperative adjuvant treatment. This article is protected by copyright.

The FA encapsulated in cRGD-PLGA/IOFA showed excellent efficacy in reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting the activation of HSCs through the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad pathway. Notably, the IONPs encapsulated in cRGD-PLGA/IOFA NPs could alleviate liver fibrosis by regulating hepatic macrophages through the NF-κB pathway, lowering the proportion of Ly6Chigh/CD86+, and degrading collagen fibers. The FA and IONPs in the cRGD-PLGA/IOFA produced a synergistic enhancement effect on collagen degradation, which was more effective than the IONPs treatment alone.

With the trend of miniaturization of equipment, smaller materials are needed. In this work, we successfully synthesized a series of M2Ga2GeO7:N3+ (M = Ca, Ba, Sr; N = Cr, Nd, Er) samples and then focused on the study of Nd3+ doped Sr2Ga2GeO7 (SGGO). A series of SGGO:xNd3+ sub-micron phosphors were prepared via a microwave-assisted sol–gel process combined with subsequent calcination at 750 ℃, and the structural information and luminescent properties were systematically studied. SGGO is a representative tetragonal crystal and belonging to the space group of P 4¯ 21m (113). The Nd3+ ions occupy eight-coordinated Sr2+ sites in the crystal lattice. From SEM analysis, the average particle size distribution is 219.7 ± 41.4 nm. The sub-micron phosphors have rich excitation spectra ranging from 350 nm to 850 nm and can produce multiband NIR emissions of 1331, 1056, and 905 nm when excited by ultraviolet and NIR light. The maximum emission intensity was obtained by optimizing the doping ratio of Nd3+ ions. A commercial chip was then utilized to fabricate light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to verify its application potential in NIR-II mini-LEDs. Compared with blue light LEDs, the as-prepared LEDs had good imaging penetration depth and could be clearly observed under 10 mm of chicken breast coverage.

This is because the sensing challenge is not trivial as it involves navigating a chemosensory space comprising thousands of volatile organic compounds. Distinct aroma recognition is based on detecting unique combinations of volatile organic compounds. In natural olfactory systems this is accomplished by employing odorant receptors (ORs) with varying specificities, together with combinatorial neural coding mechanisms. Attempts to mimic the remarkable sensitivity and accuracy of natural olfactory systems has therefore been challenging. Current portable chemical sensors for odorant detection are neither sensitive nor selective, prompting research exploring artificial olfactory devices that use natural OR proteins for sensing. Much research activity to develop OR based biosensors has concentrated on mammalian ORs, however, insect ORs have not been explored as extensively. Insects possess an extraordinary sense of smell due to a repertoire of odorant receptors evolved to interpret olfactory cues vital to the insects' survival. The potential of insect ORs as sensing elements is only now being unlocked through recent research efforts to understand their structure, ligand binding mechanisms and development of odorant biosensors. Like their mammalian counterparts, there are many challenges with working with insect ORs. These include expression, purification and presentation of the insect OR in a stable display format compatible with an effective transduction methodology while maintaining OR structure and function. Despite these challenges, significant progress has been demonstrated in developing OR-based biosensors which exploit insect ORs in cells, lipid bilayers, liposomes and nanodisc formats. Ultrasensitive and highly selective detection of volatile organic compounds has been validated by coupling these insect OR display formats with transduction methodologies spanning optical (fluorescence) and electrical (field effect transistors, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) techniques. This review summarizes the current status of insect OR based biosensors and their future outlook.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/85ea92c95c91299bbd1c154de00bff01c6f2ed8a,"The shortcomings of current fragrance nanotechnology are presented, and the prospect to develop nanotechnology based on the basic nanostructure of substrates that have many advantages over current technology is prospected.",JA.

A novel continuous process for the production of polymers and block copolymers with controlled molecular weights has also been developed using packed column reactor technologies. New versatile vinyl-containing initiators, 2'-vinyloxyethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate (VBIB) and 3'-vinyloxylpropyl trichloroacetamide (VTCA), were screened for the macromonomer synthesis of different vinyl monomer types by ATRP. Polymethacrylate and polystyrene macromonomers of well-controlled molecular weights were obtained without consumption of the initiators' vinyl moieties at monomer conversions lower than 80%. However, the ATRP of acrylates started to consume the vinyl moieties at medium conversions. Therefore, the polymerization of acrylates must be terminated at an early stage in order to obtain their macromonomers.

Here, a macrophage-membrane-coated nanoparticle is developed for tumor-targeted chemotherapy delivery with a controlled release profile in response to tumor microenvironment stimuli. Upon fulfilling its mission of tumor homing and RES evasion, the macrophage-membrane coating can be shed via morphological changes driven by extracellular microenvironment stimuli. The nanoparticles discharged from the outer membrane coating show penetration efficiency enhanced by their size advantage and surface modifications. After internalization by the tumor cells, the loaded drug is quickly released from the nanoparticles in response to the endosome pH.

The most important and difficult delivery of vitamin B12 is that to bone marrow and nerve cells. Herein we present a first step towards the development of two types of smart carriers, polymer capsules and lyotropic liquid-crystalline nanosystems, for vitamin B12 targeted delivery and induced release. A vitamin B12 encapsulation technique into nanoengineered polymeric capsules produced by layer-by-layer assembling of polymeric shells on CaCO3 templates has been developed. The effectiveness of the process was demonstrated by optical absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and small-angle X-ray diffraction. TEM and AFM analyses performed on capsules after their drying, confirmed the presence of the vitamin B12 inside the capsules in the form of crystalline nanoaggregates, 50-300 nm in diameter. Soft lipid nanovectors consisting of amphiphilic phytantriol molecules, which in water excess spontaneously self-assembly in 3D well-ordered inverse bicontinuous cubic bulk phase, were used as alternative carriers for vitamin B12.

Upon exposure of the nanoassembly to the reductive tumor microenvironment, the chondroitin sulfate-based nanogel can degrade to release the doxorubicin-loaded starch nanoparticles in the tumor to facilitate improved intratumoral penetration. CT26 colon carcinoma spheroids could be efficiently penetrated by the nanoassembly (resulting in 1 order of magnitude higher DOX-derived fluorescence inside the spheroid relative to free DOX), while in vivo experiments showed that doxorubicin-loaded nanoassemblies reduced tumor sizes by 6× relative to saline controls and 2× relative to free DOX after 21 days.

Viral vectors have been extensively tested in clinical gene-therapy trials, but nonviral vectors such as cationic polymers or lipids are much less used due to their lower gene-transfection efficiencies. However, the advantages of nonviral vectors, such as easily tailored structures, nonimmunogenetics, and relatively low cost, still drive great efforts to improve their transfection efficiencies. A reverse question asks if nonviral vectors with current gene transfection efficiency can find application niches. Herein, we synthesized a cationic polymer, poly{ N-[2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl]- N-[ p-acetyloxyphenyl]- N, N-diethylammonium chloride} (PQDEA), as a gene-delivery carrier and compared it side by side with chemotherapy drugs for cancer treatment. PQDEA is rapidly hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases into anionic poly(acrylic acid) to give low cytotoxicity and fast release of DNA for expression. PQDEA formed stable complexes with DNA (PQDEA/DNA polyplexes), which were further coated with a lipid layer to make serum-stable lipidic polyplexes, LPQDEA/DNAs, for in vivo use. In an intraperitoneal tumor xenograft model mimicking late-stage metastatic cervical cancer, the LPQDEA/DNA vector with TRAIL suicide gene exerted strong tumor inhibition as effective as paclitaxel, the first-line anticancer drug, but gave much less tumor relapse and much longer survival than the clinical chemotherapy drugs, irinotecan and paclitaxel.

The poly(ionic liquid)s had enhanced CO2 sorption capacities and fast sorption/desorption rates compared with room temperature ionic liquids. The effects of the chemical structures, including the types of anion, cation, and backbone of the poly(ionic liquid)s on their CO2 sorption have been discussed. In contrast to room temperature ionic liquids, the polymer with PF anions had the highest CO2-sorption capacity, while those with BF or Tf2N− anions had the same capacities. The CO2 sorption and desorption of the polymers were fast and reversible, and the sorption was selective over H2, N2, and O2. The measured Henry's constants of P[VBBI][BF4] and P[MABI][BF4] were 26.0 bar and 37.7 bar, which were lower than those of similar room temperature ionic liquids.

Monodiseperse porous silica microspheres (MPSMs) have been widely used as column packings in HPLC. However, synthesis of MPSMs with controllable sizes of both particles and pores for the separation of small solutes and proteins in HPLC still remains a challenge. In this paper, an effective and facile approach to prepare MPSMs with controllable particle size and pore size by using porous polymer microspheres as templates is presented. By employing porous PGMA/EDMA microspheres as templates and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the silica source, 5 μm MPSMs with tunable pore sizes were synthesized successfully. The as-prepared MPSMs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic laser scattering, and mercury intrusion porosimetry. The results indicated that the MPSMs obtained retained the original size of the polymer templating particles and calcination caused almost no shrinkage. Furthermore, the effects of the pore size of polymer template microspheres, different amino-functionalizations of PGMA/EDMA microspheres and the mass ratio of PGMA/EDMA microspheres/TEOS on the pore size of MPSMs were carefully studied. The results indicated that the pore size of MPSMs was adjusted from 20 to 69 nm by controlling the pore size of the polymer microspheres and the mass ratio of PGMA/EDMA microspheres/TEOS in the sol-gel process. In addition, the amino-functionalization of PGMA/EDMA microspheres with different structure-directing agents, such as (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), trimethylamine hydrochloride (TMA) and tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), also resulted in MPSMs with the different pore sizes. MPSMs with large pore sizes of more than 30 nm were fabricated by using TEPA-functionalized PGMA/EDMA microspheres as templates, while with TMA-functionalized PGMA/EDMA microspheres as templates, MPSMs with pore sizes of approximately 10 nm were obtained. The as-prepared MPSMs were further modified with different silanes, such as C4, C8 and C18, to explore as stationary phases for the separation of proteins and small solutes in reversed phase liquidi chromatography (RPLC). The results illustrated that the baseline separation of 7 kinds of proteins could be achieved based on MPSMs with pore sizes of 30 nm, and 6 kinds of alkyl benzenes and 5 kinds of aromatic alcohol homologs could be separated completely based on MPSMs with pore sizes of 11 nm.

However, the major challenges remain on how to achieve facile spatiotemporal delivery of these therapies, allowing ease of manipulation and ensuring differential drug release for enhanced synergistic therapeutic effects. In the present study, we introduced a tumor microenvironment (TME)-adapted hydrogel with the phenylboronic acid-modified dipyridamole prodrug (DIPP) as a crosslinker. This prodrug hydrogel scaffold, 3BP@DIPPGel, could be formed in situ by a simple mixture of DIPP and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and loaded with a high ratio of 3-bromopyruvic acid (3BP). The 3BP@DIPPGel enables spatiotemporal localized delivery of dipyridamole (DIP) and 3BP with distinct release kinetics that effectively reshape the immunosuppressive TME. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulation, 3BP@DIPPGel preferentially released 3BP, inducing tumor-specific pyroptosis via the ROS/BAX/caspase-3/GSDME signaling pathway and decreasing the secretion of chemokines such as CCL8 to counteract macrophage recruitment. Subsequently, the crosslinked DIP is released, triggering the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization towards the immunostimulatory M1 phenotype via the CCR2/JAK2/STAT3 cascade signaling pathway. This dual action from 3BP@DIPPGel leads to the restoration of tumor cell immunogenicity with high efficacy and activation of immune cells. Furthermore, the 3BP@DIPPGel-based chemoimmunotherapy upregulates the expression of sialic-acid-binding Ig-like lectin 10 and hence sensitizing tumors to anti-CD24 therapy in the tumor-bearing mice. Therefore, this strategy can have significant potential in the prevention of tumor metastases and recurrence. To the best of our understanding, this study represents a pioneering showcase of tumor pyroptosis, induced by glycolytic inhibitors, which can be effectively coordinated with DIP-mediated TAM polarization for immune activation, offering a new paradigm for differentially sustained drug delivery to foster cancer immunotherapy.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f93664314754e0cd3aea60fe8cf50c775b06c4b,"This study represents a pioneering showcase of tumor pyroptosis, induced by glycolytic inhibitors, which can be effectively coordinated with DIP-mediated TAM polarization for immune activation, offering a new paradigm for differentially sustained drug delivery to foster cancer immunotherapy.",B.

Despite the widespread use of cisplatin since its discovery, cisplatin resistance developed during prolonged chemotherapy, similar to other small molecule chemotherapeutic agents, severely limits its clinical application. Cisplatin resistance in cancer cells is mainly caused by three reasons: DNA repair, decreased cisplatin uptake/increased efflux, and cisplatin inactivation. In earlier combination therapies, the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells prevented the achievement of the desired therapeutic effect even with the accurate combination of two chemotherapeutic drugs. Therefore, combination therapy using nanocarriers for co-delivery of drugs is considered to be ideal for alleviating cisplatin resistance and reducing cisplatin-related toxicity in cancer cells.

The intravesical conjugates rapidly translocated across the mucus layer, specifically bound to tumors, and infiltrated throughout the tumor via direct intercellular transfer. Notably, direct transfer from normal cells to tumor cells was unidirectional because the pathways required for direct transfer, termed F-actin-rich tunneling nanotubes, were more unidirectionally extended from normal cells to tumor cells.

By capitalizing on the phase separation effect, this method bypasses traditional requirements such as cryogelation and templating that necessitate low temperatures or solvent etching. The presence of PVA molecules promotes the regional aggregation of alginates, leading to enhanced toughness, and also occupies larger interstitial spaces between the densely packed alginate phases, facilitating pore formation.

The unique pH-dependent cationic-to-zwitterionic transition of OPDMA in the characteristic acidic-to-neutral pH gradient from the skin surface to deep SC enables fast transdermal delivery of OPDMA and its conjugate. On the skin, OPDMA binds to carboxylic acids in the acidic sebum layer, enriching OPDMA-I on the SC. As pH increases in deeper SC layers, binding between OPDMA-I and the skin weakens gradually, allowing for diffusion through inter-corneocyte gaps and penetration into viable epidermis and finally entering the systemic circulation via dermal lymphatic vessels. This process does not alter SC microstructures or cause any physiological changes in the skin. This study represents a groundbreaking example of noninvasive transdermal protein delivery.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a593221eccfb0684cacf542dcbf6746abfe825de,"This study finds a tertiary amine oxide-based polyzwitterion, OPDMA, that can efficiently penetrate both the stratum corneum and viable epidermis into circulation and its conjugate with insulin can exhibit hypoglycemic effects as efficiently as subcutaneously injected insulin in type-1 diabetic mice and minipigs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we adopted a simple model, mainly to illustrate the impact of polyplex charge density on the self-assembly of liposomes (containing DOPE and CHEMS lipids) using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulation results show that when the charge density increases in the polyplex, more lipids, especially CHEMS (a negatively charged helper lipid) lipids, are attracted to the polyplex (positively charged) surface, and meanwhile nearby water molecules are driven away from the polyplex, resulting in a less spherical liposome. Energy decomposition analyses further reveal that, at higher charge densities, the polyplex exhibits much stronger interactions with CHEMS lipids than with water molecules, with the majority contribution from electrostatic interactions. In addition, the mobility of lipids, especially CHEMS, is reduced as the polyplex charge density increases, indicating a more rigid liposome.

The efficacy of the utilization of Sasobit/waste cooking oil (Sasobit/WCO) as a warm-mix additive has been demonstrated in mitigating the adverse consequences of thermal aging on SBR-modified bitumen binder (SB) while preserving the binder's original performance characteristics. However, few studies have been conducted to further investigate the rheological properties and aging resistance of SB modified with Sasobit/WCO compounds. In this work, three additives-Sasobit, WCO, and Sasobit/WCO composite-were selected, and their effects on the physical and rheological characteristics of SB as well as the temperatures at which the mixtures were prepared were assessed. In addition, by using dynamic shear rheometers (DSR) and bending beam rheometers (BBR), the effects of this innovative warm-mix addition on the performance grade (PG) and aging resistances of SB were evaluated. According to the results, Sasobit/WCO composites outperform Sasobit and WCO in lowering the mixture preparation temperature. Sasobit/WCO also improves both the high- and low-temperature performance of SB simultaneously. Compared to hot-mix asphalt mixtures, the addition of Sasobit/WCO reduces the preparation temperature of the bitumen mixtures by 19 °C, which in turn helps to minimize the negative effects of temperature aging on the functioning of the SB. Additionally, the Sasobit/WCO composite addition can improve the SB mixture's resistance to thermal cracking. After the introduction of Sasobit/WCO, the high-temperature PG of SB was raised by two levels, regardless of whether the warm-mix impact was taken into account. With the addition of Sasobit/WCO, SB's resilience to short-term aging was enhanced.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1c7081cc6745611d81971626fdab63c1605fd3c6,,X.

METHODS: Fifty-three rats were randomly assigned into non-exercise (NE) with restricted-fat-diet (RFD), mild-intensity endurance exercise (MEE) with RFD, high-intensity interval exercise (HIE) with RFD, NE with high-fat-diet (HFD), MEE with HFD, and HIE with HFD. All exercise groups were trained for 10 weeks with matched running distances. Dietary intake, body weight, fat weight, metabolic blood chemicals, and serum CORT concentration were measured and analyzed. Histological lipid droplets in liver were observed. SPSS for Windows 18.0 was used for the statistical analyses and a significant level was set at P≤0.05. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in caloric intake was observed between RFD and HFD groups. NE rats with HFD led to high level of body weight, fat weight, blood glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and lipid vacuoles in hepatic histology, but low level of quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). HIE rats with HFD improved metabolic phonotype, reduced body weight (406.7±18.9 g, P<0.001), showed lower blood glucose (8.6±0.7 mmol/L, P<0.01) and lipid profiles, but higher QUICKI (0.298±0.004, P<0.01). The levels of CORT in HFD groups were much higher compared to those in RFD groups (P<0.001), especially in NE rats. HIE training significantly reduced the CORT concentration in HFD rats (41.1±0.6 ng/ml, P<0.001). Correlations analyses revealed that CORT levels were significantly associated with fat weights (r=0.50, P<0.001), blood glucose (r=0.52, P<0.001), and triglycerides (r=0.28, P<0.05), while it inversely correlated with QUICKI (r=-0.38, P<0.01) for all groups. CONCLUSIONS: HIE training and HFD, independently and/or synergistically, have profound effects on metabolic phenotype and stress response. HFD could induce metabolic disorder and elicit the exacerbated stress response by stimulating elevated serum CORT and imbalance blood chemicals. HIE training contribute to the improvement in metabolic phenotypes and the decreases in serum CORT levels so as to reduce susceptibility to high-fat stress-associated disorders.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9667ad407dd1eb588d52276c0140fdadfc4e8b53,"HIE training and HFD, independently and/or synergistically, have profound effects on metabolic phenotype and stress response and contribute to the improvement in metabolic phenotypes and the decreases in serum CORT levels so as to reduce susceptibility to high-fat stress-associated disorders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examined the multiscale distribution of sacituzumab govitecan (SG; Trodelvy), a recently clinically approved ADC, to clarify the mechanism(s) of efficacy given its unique design strategy. We employed a multiscale quantitative pharmacokinetic approach, including near-infrared fluorescence imaging, single-cell flow cytometry measurements, payload distribution via γH2AX pharmacodynamic staining, and a novel dual-labeled fluorescent technique to track the ADC and payload in a high trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 expression xenograft model of gastric cancer (NCI-N87). We found that rapid release of the SN-38 payload from the hydrolysable linker inside cells imparts more DNA damage in vitro and in vivo than an ADC with a more stable enzyme cleavable linker. With SG, little to no extracellular payload release in the tumor was observed using a dual-labeled fluorescence technique, although bystander effects were detected. The high dosing regimen allowed the clinical dose to reach the majority of cancer cells, which has been linked to improved efficacy. In addition, the impact of multiple doses (day 1 and day 8) of a 21-day cycle was found to further improve tissue penetration despite not changing tumor uptake [percent injected dose per gram (%ID/g)] of the ADC. These results show increased ADC efficacy with SG can be attributed to efficient tumor penetration and intracellular linker cleavage after ADC internalization. This quantitative approach to study multiscale delivery can be used to inform the design of next-generation ADCs and prodrugs for other targets.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29c82baacbe06968323794faa53062e230428b0b,A dual fluorescent prodrug for in vivo tumor imaging and therapy and its application in clinical practice is proposed.,A.

In vitro experiments verify that the high intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations in tumor cells cause cleavage of the disulfide linker, resulting in concomitantly the active drug CPT release and significant NIR fluorescence turn-on with large Stokes shift (200 nm). The NIR fluorescence of DCM-S-CPT at 665 nm with fast response to GSH can act as a direct off-on signal reporter for the GSH-activatable prodrug. Particularly, DCM-S-CPT possesses much better photostability than ICG, which is highly desirable for in situ fluorescence-tracking of cancer chemotherapy. DCM-S-CPT has been successfully utilized for in vivo and in situ tracking of drug release and cancer therapeutic efficacy in living animals by NIR fluorescence. DCM-S-CPT exhibits excellent tumor-activatable performance when intravenously injected into tumor-bearing nude mice, as well as specific cancer therapy with few side effects. DCM-S-CPT loaded in PEG-PLA nanoparticles shows even higher antitumor activity than free CPT, and is also retained longer in the plasma. The tumor-targeting ability and the specific drug release in tumors make DCM-S-CPT as a promising prodrug, providing significant advances toward deeper understanding and exploration of theranostic drug-delivery systems.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6dc8baf1ac37e80a3400dbab05112e45ca941f29,"The tumor-targeting ability and the specific drug release in tumors make DCM-S-CPT as a promising prodrug, providing significant advances toward deeper understanding and exploration of theranostic drug-delivery systems.",X.

Thus, this review will focus on the various delivery systems that can be used and the different barriers that need to be surmounted for the development of stable inhalable siRNA formulations for human use before siRNA therapeutics for ALI/ARDS become available in the clinic.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3990ec8382976f194b1f456f3bba537a771e20d0,,M.

The high uptake of CO2 (115.6 cm3·g-1) and selectivity over N2 (30:1) at 273 K indicated that these MOFs are excellent candidates for postcombustion CO2 isolation and capture. The MOFs feature high catalytic activity, rapid dynamics of transformation and excellent stability with turnover number (TON) values up to 110 000 per paddlewheel unit after 5 × 6 rounds of recyclability, demonstrating that they are promising heterogeneous catalysts for CO2 cyclo-addition to value-added cyclic carbonates. The cycloaddition of epoxides with wet gases demonstrated that the catalyst activity was not affected by moisture, and the indices of the PXRD patterns of the bulk samples filtered from the catalytic reaction revealed that the crystallinities were maintained. The combination of the selective capture and catalytic transformation in one-pot enables the use of a negative-cost feedstock-raw power plant flue gas without any separation and purification-revealing the broad prospects of such MOFs for practical CO2 fixation in industry.",,,X.

Herein, we report a new copper-based complex CuBr/N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) as a versatile and highly active catalyst for acrylic, methacrylic, and styrenic monomers. The catalyst mediated ATRP at a catalyst/initiator molar ratio of 0.005 and produced polymers with well-controlled molecular weights and low polydispersities. ATRP occurred even at a catalyst/initiator molar ratio as low as 0.001 with copper concentration in the produced polymers as low as 6-8 ppm (catalyst/monomer molar ratio = 10(-5)). The catalyst structures were studied by X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy. The activator CuIBr/TPEN existed in solution as binuclear and mononuclear complexes in equilibrium but as a binuclear complex in its single crystals. The deactivator CuIIBr2/TPEN complex was mononuclear. High stability and appropriate KATRP (ATRP equilibrium constant) were found crucial for the catalyst working under high dilution or in coordinating solvents/monomers.

The potential of PRBP as a gene vector was systematically evaluated in vitro. The results show that PRBP can compact DNA and form PRBP/DNA polylexes with a particle size of 50-100 nm. The PRBP/DNA polylexes can protect DNA degradation from DNase I efficiently. Compared with PEI, higher transfection efficiency was achieved by the PRBP.

The recovered catalyst still mediated a living polymerization of MMA with reduced activity (54-64%), but had much improved control of the polymerization. The resulting PMMA had molecular weights very close to theoretical vales.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e152db1d40fe33338fea6552cc083ccc2558e048,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel treatments including nanomedicines and combination therapies are thus urgently needed for these types of deadly diseases. A key feature of pancreatic cancer is its tumor protective dense stroma, which is generated by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The interaction between CAFs and pancreatic cancer cells abnormally activates sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling and facilitates tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance. Here, we report that the commercial SHH inhibitor GDC-0449 reverses fibroblast-induced resistance to doxorubicin in Smoothened (SMO)-positive pancreatic cancer cells by downregulating SHH signaling proteins. Importantly, the synergistic combination of GDC-0449 with PEG-PCL-Dox exhibited potent antitumor efficacy in a BxPC-3 tumor xenograft model, whereas single treatments did not significantly inhibit tumor growth.

We also demonstrated that poly(ionic liquid) brushes with gradient thickness and wettability were easily accessible by regulating the distance between the opposite plates of Fe0 SI-ATRP. Moreover, the resultant poly(ionic liquid) brushes presented excellent antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli (99.2%) and Bacillus subtilis (88.1%) after 24 h and low attachment for proteins and marine algae (≤5%) for over 2 weeks.

Herein, we demonstrate a new concept directly using drug molecules to fabricate nanocarriers in order to minimize use of inert materials, substantially increase the drug loading content, and suppress premature burst release. Taking advantage of the strong hydrophobicity of the anticancer drug camptothecin (CPT), one or two CPT molecule(s) were conjugated to a very short oligomer chain of ethylene glycol (OEG), forming amphiphilic phospholipid-mimicking prodrugs, OEG-CPT or OEG-DiCPT. The prodrugs formed stable liposome-like nanocapsules with a CPT loading content as high as 40 or 58 wt % with no burst release in aqueous solution. OEG-DiCPT released CPT once inside cells, which showed high in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity. Meanwhile, the resulting nanocapsules can be loaded with a water-soluble drug-doxorubicin salt (DOX.HCl)-with a high loading efficiency. The DOX.HCl-loaded nanocapsules simultaneously delivered two anticancer drugs, leading to a synergetic cytotoxicity to cancer cells.
