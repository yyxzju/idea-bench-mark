Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'8-has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)-a blind assessment of the state of the field-AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7.",

Here we markedly expand the structural coverage of the proteome by applying the state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold2, at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.",

To study association mechanisms, we performed additional, conventional MD simulations, in which we observed numerous spontaneous association events. A shared feature of native association for these five structurally and functionally diverse protein systems was that if the proteins made contact far from the native interface, the native state was reached by dissociation and eventual reassociation near the native interface, rather than by extensive interfacial exploration while the proteins remained in contact. At the transition state (the conformational ensemble from which association to the native complex and dissociation are equally likely), the protein-protein interfaces were still highly hydrated, and no more than 20% of native contacts had formed.",

This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict enhancer-promoter interactions directly from the DNA sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input.

Our simulations suggest, moreover, that some cancer-linked mutations distal to the dimerization interface, particularly the widespread L834R mutation (also referred to as L858R), facilitate EGFR dimerization by suppressing this local disorder. Corroborating these findings, our biophysical experiments and kinase enzymatic assays indicate that the L834R mutation causes abnormally high activity primarily by promoting EGFR dimerization rather than by allowing activation without dimerization. We also find that phosphorylation of EGFR kinase domain at Tyr845 may suppress the intrinsic disorder, suggesting a molecular mechanism for autonomous EGFR signaling.",

We have developed a general method to extract the dimensions and solvent quality (self-interactions) of IDPs from a single small-angle x-ray scattering measurement. We applied this procedure to a variety of IDPs and found that even IDPs with low net charge and high hydrophobicity remain highly expanded in water, contrary to the general expectation that protein-like sequences collapse in water.

Our analysis exhibits mixed agreement with prior studies because of the use of more accurate ensembles and contributions from correlated motions. Buried side chains lose only a factor of 1.4 in the number of conformations available per rotamer upon folding (ΩU/ΩN). The entropy loss for helical and sheet residues differs due to the smaller motions of helical residues (TΔShelix-sheet = 0.5 kcal⋅mol(-1)), a property not fully reflected in the amide N-H and carbonyl C=O bond NMR order parameters.

To demonstrate this, here we show that label free SiNWs can be internalized in multiple cell lines, forming robust cytoskeletal interfaces, and when kinked can serve as free-standing inter- and intracellular force probes capable of continuous extended (>1 h) force monitoring. Our results show that intercellular interactions exhibit ratcheting like behavior with force peaks of ∼69.6 pN/SiNW, while intracellular force peaks of ∼116.9 pN/SiNW were recorded during smooth muscle contraction. To accomplish this, we have introduced a simple single-capture dark-field/phase contrast optical imaging modality, scatter enhanced phase contrast (SEPC), which enables the simultaneous visualization of both cellular components and inorganic nanostructures. This approach demonstrates that rationally designed devices capable of substrate-independent operation are achievable, providing a simple and scalable method for continuous inter- and intracellular force dynamics studies.",

We re-examine this trade-off in the more realistic regime in which parameterization is a greater source of error than the level of detail in the force field. To address parameterization of coarse-grained force fields, we use the contrastive divergence technique from machine learning to train from simulations of 450 proteins. In our procedure, the computational efficiency of the model enables high accuracy through the precise tuning of the Boltzmann ensemble. This method is applied to our recently developed Upside model, where the free energy for side chains is rapidly calculated at every time-step, allowing for a smooth energy landscape without steric rattling of the side chains. After this contrastive divergence training, the model is able to de novo fold proteins up to 100 residues on a single core in days. This improved Upside model provides a starting point both for investigation of folding dynamics and as an inexpensive Bayesian prior for protein physics that can be integrated with additional experimental or bioinformatic data.",

This supports the conclusion that the OoL was a gradual process of chemical evolution involving a series of transitional forms between prebiotic chemistry and the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) during which RNA played a central role, and that many of the events and their relative order of occurrence along this pathway are known.

The presence of genes homologous to eukaryotic meiotic genes in archaea and bacteria suggests that DNA repair mechanisms evolved towards meiotic recombination.

Here, we identify archaeal proteins that are homologs of fusexins, a superfamily of fusogens that mediate eukaryotic gamete and somatic cell fusion, as well as virus entry. The crystal structure of a trimeric archaeal fusexin (Fusexin1 or Fsx1) reveals an archetypical fusexin architecture with unique features such as a six-helix bundle and an additional globular domain. Ectopically expressed Fusexin1 can fuse mammalian cells, and this process involves the additional globular domain and a conserved fusion loop. Furthermore, archaeal fusexin genes are found within integrated mobile elements, suggesting potential roles in cell-cell fusion and gene exchange in archaea, as well as different scenarios for the evolutionary history of fusexins.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the nature of the glass transition--the dramatic slowing of dynamics and eventual emergence of a disordered solid from a cooling liquid--is a fundamental challenge in physical science. A central characteristic of glass-forming liquids is a non-exponential main relaxation process. The extent of deviation from exponential relaxation typically becomes more pronounced on cooling. Theories that predict a growth of spatially heterogeneous dynamics as temperature is lowered can explain these observations. In apparent contradiction to these theories, however, some experiments suggest that certain substances--notably including the intensely studied molecular glass-former ortho-terphenyl (OTP)--have a main relaxation process whose shape is essentially temperature independent, even though other observables predicted to be correlated with the degree of dynamical heterogeneity are temperature dependent. Here we report the first simulations based on an atomistic model of OTP that reach equilibrium at temperatures well into the supercooled regime. We first show that the results of these simulations are in reasonable quantitative agreement with experimental data for several basic properties over a wide range of temperatures. We then focus on rotational relaxation, finding nearly exponential behavior at high temperatures with clearly increasing deviations as temperature is lowered. The much weaker temperature dependence observed in light-scattering experiments also emerges from the same simulation data when we calculate correlation functions similar to those probed experimentally; this highlights the diversity of temperature dependencies that can be obtained with different probes. Further analysis suggests that the temperature insensitivity observed in the light-scattering experiments stems from the dependence of these measurements on internal as well as rotational molecular motion. Within the temperature range of our OTP simulations, our results strongly suggest that this archetypal glass-former behaves as anticipated by theories of the glass transition that predict increasing non-exponentiality with cooling, and our simulations thus strengthen the evidence supporting such theories.",

Here, we simulate these measurements, conducting hundreds of unfolding trajectories using our fast Upside algorithm for slow enough speeds to reproduce key experimental features that may be missed using all-atom methods. The speed also enables us to determine the logarithmic dependence of pulling velocities on the rupture levels to better compare to experimental values. For simulations of atomic force microscope measurements in which force is applied vertically to the C-terminus of bacteriorhodopsin, we reproduce the major experimental features including even the back-and-forth unfolding of single helical turns. When pulling laterally on GlpG to mimic the experiment, we observe quite different behavior depending on the stiffness of the spring. With a soft spring, as used in the experimental studies with magnetic tweezers, the force remains nearly constant after the initial unfolding event, and a few pathways and a high degree of cooperativity are observed in both the experiment and simulation. With a stiff spring, however, the force drops to near zero after each major unfolding event, and numerous intermediates are observed along a wide variety of pathways. Hence, the mode of force application significantly alters the perception of the folding landscape, including the number of intermediates and the degree of folding cooperativity, important issues that should be considered when designing experiments and interpreting unfolding data.",

This unique IGFBP5 anchor peptide that mediates the specific PAPP-A-IGFBP5 interaction is not found in other PAPP-A substrates. Additionally, we illustrate the critical role of the PAPP-A central domain as it mediates both IGFBP5 recognition and trans-dimerization.

To address parameterization of coarse-grained forcefields, we use the contrastive divergence technique from machine learning to train directly from simulation trajectories on 450 proteins. In our scheme, the computational efficiency of the model enables high accuracy through precise tuning of the Boltzmann ensemble over a large collection of proteins. This method is applied to our recently developed Upside model [1], where the free energy for side chains are rapidly calculated at every time-step, allowing for a smooth energy landscape without steric rattling of the side chains. After our contrastive divergence training, the model is able to fold proteins up to approximately 100 residues de novo on a single core in CPU core-days. Additionally, the improved Upside model is a strong starting point both for investigation of folding dynamics and as an inexpensive Bayesian prior for protein physics that can be integrated with additional experimental or bioinformatic data.",

How to accurately identify DNA-binding residues from only protein sequence remains a challenging task. Currently, most existing sequence-based methods only consider contextual features of the sequential neighbors, which are limited to capture spatial information. Based on the recent breakthrough in protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2, we propose an accurate predictor, GraphSite, for identifying DNA-binding residues based on the structural models predicted by AlphaFold2.

The former provides a static structure, while the latter explains the dynamic folding pathway to that structure. We challenge the current status quo and advocate that AF2 has indeed learned some protein folding principles, despite being designed for structure prediction. AF2's high-dimensional parameters encode an imperfect biophysical scoring function. Typically, AF2 uses multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to guide the search within a narrow region of its learned surface. In our study, we operate AF2 without MSAs or initial templates, forcing it to sample its entire energy landscape - more akin to an ab initio approach. Among over 7,000 proteins, a fraction fold using sequence alone, highlighting the smoothness of AF2's learned energy surface.

It predicts protein structure by building an alignment between the query sequence under prediction and the templates with solved structures. However, it is still very challenging to build the optimal sequence-template alignment, especially when only distantly related templates are available. Here we report a novel deep learning approach ProALIGN that can predict much more accurate sequence-template alignment. Like protein sequences consisting of sequence motifs, protein alignments are also composed of frequently occurring alignment motifs with characteristic patterns. Alignment motifs are context-specific as their characteristic patterns are tightly related to sequence contexts of the aligned regions. Inspired by this observation, we represent a protein alignment as a binary matrix (in which 1 denotes an aligned residue pair) and then use a deep convolutional neural network to predict the optimal alignment from the query protein and its template. The trained neural network implicitly but effectively encodes an alignment scoring function, which reduces inaccuracies in the handcrafted scoring functions widely used by the current threading approaches. For a query protein and a template, we apply the neural network to directly infer likelihoods of all possible residue pairs in their entirety, which could effectively consider the correlations among multiple residues. We further construct the alignment with maximum likelihood, and finally build a structure model according to the alignment. Tested on three independent data sets with a total of 6688 protein alignment targets and 80 CASP13 TBM targets, our method achieved much better alignments and 3D structure models than the existing methods, including HHpred, CNFpred, CEthreader, and DeepThreader.

However, the functions of most proteins remain unannotated. Traditional experimental methods for annotation of protein functions are costly and time-consuming. Current deep learning methods typically rely on Graph Convolutional Networks to propagate features between protein residues. However, these methods fail to capture fine atomic-level geometric structural features and cannot directly compute or propagate structural features (such as distances, directions, and angles) when transmitting features, often simplifying them to scalars. Additionally, difficulties in capturing long-range dependencies limit the model's ability to identify key nodes (residues). To address these challenges, we propose a geometric graph network (GGN-GO) for predicting protein function that enriches feature extraction by capturing multi-scale geometric structural features at the atomic and residue levels. We use a geometric vector perceptron to convert these features into vector representations and aggregate them with node features for better understanding and propagation in the network. Moreover, we introduce a graph attention pooling layer captures key node information by adaptively aggregating local functional motifs, while contrastive learning enhances graph representation discriminability through random noise and different views. The experimental results show that GGN-GO outperforms six comparative methods in tasks with the most labels for both experimentally validated and predicted protein structures. Furthermore, GGN-GO identifies functional residues corresponding to those experimentally confirmed, showcasing its interpretability and the ability to pinpoint key protein regions.
