        "abstract": "The Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) and the Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) methods calculate binding free energies for macromolecules by combining molecular mechanics calculations and continuum solvation models. To systematically evaluate the performance of these methods, we report here an extensive study of 59 ligands interacting with six different proteins. First, we explored the effects of the length of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, ranging from 400 to 4800 ps, and the solute dielectric constant (1, 2, or 4) on the binding free energies predicted by MM/PBSA. The following three important conclusions could be observed: (1) MD simulation length has an obvious impact on the predictions, and longer MD simulation is not always necessary to achieve better predictions. (2) The predictions are quite sensitive to the solute dielectric constant, and this parameter should be carefully determined according to the characteristics of the protein/ligand binding interface. (3) Conformational entropy often show large fluctuations in MD trajectories, and a large number of snapshots are necessary to achieve stable predictions. Next, we evaluated the accuracy of the binding free energies calculated by three Generalized Born (GB) models. We found that the GB model developed by Onufriev and Case was the most successful model in ranking the binding affinities of the studied inhibitors. Finally, we evaluated the performance of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA in predicting binding free energies. Our results showed that MM/PBSA performed better in calculating absolute, but not necessarily relative, binding free energies than MM/GBSA. Considering its computational efficiency, MM/GBSA can serve as a powerful tool in drug design, where correct ranking of inhibitors is often emphasized.",

In silico ADMET evaluation models have been developed as an additional tool to assist medicinal chemists in the design and optimization of leads. Here, we announced the release of ADMETlab 2.0, a completely redesigned version of the widely used AMDETlab web server for the predictions of pharmacokinetics and toxicity properties of chemicals, of which the supported ADMET-related endpoints are approximately twice the number of the endpoints in the previous version, including 17 physicochemical properties, 13 medicinal chemistry properties, 23 ADME properties, 27 toxicity endpoints and 8 toxicophore rules (751 substructures). A multi-task graph attention framework was employed to develop the robust and accurate models in ADMETlab 2.0. The batch computation module was provided in response to numerous requests from users, and the representation of the results was further optimized. The ADMETlab 2.0 server is freely available, without registration, at https://admetmesh.scbdd.com/.",

        "abstract": "As one of the most popular computational approaches in modern structure-based drug design, molecular docking can be used not only to identify the correct conformation of a ligand within the target binding pocket but also to estimate the strength of the interaction between a target and a ligand. Nowadays, as a variety of docking programs are available for the scientific community, a comprehensive understanding of the advantages and limitations of each docking program is fundamentally important to conduct more reasonable docking studies and docking-based virtual screening. In the present study, based on an extensive dataset of 2002 protein-ligand complexes from the PDBbind database (version 2014), the performance of ten docking programs, including five commercial programs (LigandFit, Glide, GOLD, MOE Dock, and Surflex-Dock) and five academic programs (AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, LeDock, rDock, and UCSF DOCK), was systematically evaluated by examining the accuracies of binding pose prediction (sampling power) and binding affinity estimation (scoring power). Our results showed that GOLD and LeDock had the best sampling power (GOLD: 59.8% accuracy for the top scored poses; LeDock: 80.8% accuracy for the best poses) and AutoDock Vina had the best scoring power (rp/rs of 0.564/0.580 and 0.569/0.584 for the top scored poses and best poses), suggesting that the commercial programs did not show the expected better performance than the academic ones. Overall, the ligand binding poses could be identified in most cases by the evaluated docking programs but the ranks of the binding affinities for the entire dataset could not be well predicted by most docking programs. However, for some types of protein families, relatively high linear correlations between docking scores and experimental binding affinities could be achieved. To our knowledge, this study has been the most extensive evaluation of popular molecular docking programs in the last five years. It is expected that our work can offer useful information for the successful application of these docking tools to different requirements and targets.",

        "abstract": "In molecular docking, it is challenging to develop a scoring function that is accurate to conduct high-throughput screenings. Most scoring functions implemented in popular docking software packages were developed with many approximations for computational efficiency, which sacrifices the accuracy of prediction. With advanced technology and powerful computational hardware nowadays, it is feasible to use rigorous scoring functions, such as molecular mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) and molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) in molecular docking studies. Here, we systematically investigated the performance of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA to identify the correct binding conformations and predict the binding free energies for 98 protein-ligand complexes. Comparison studies showed that MM/GBSA (69.4%) outperformed MM/PBSA (45.5%) and many popular scoring functions to identify the correct binding conformations. Moreover, we found that molecular dynamics simulations are necessary for some systems to identify the correct binding conformations. Based on our results, we proposed the guideline for MM/GBSA to predict the binding conformations. We then tested the performance of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA to reproduce the binding free energies of the 98 protein-ligand complexes. The best prediction of MM/GBSA model with internal dielectric constant 2.0, produced a Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.66, which is better than MM/PBSA (0.49) and almost all scoring functions used in molecular docking. In summary, MM/GBSA performs well for both binding pose predictions and binding free-energy estimations and is efficient to re-score the top-hit poses produced by other less-accurate scoring functions.",

        "abstract": "By using different evaluation strategies, we systemically evaluated the performance of Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) and Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) methodologies based on more than 1800 protein-ligand crystal structures in the PDBbind database. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) for the one-protein-family/one-binding-ligand case which represents the unbiased protein-ligand complex sampling, both MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA methodologies achieve approximately equal accuracies at the interior dielectric constant of 4 (with rp = 0.408 ± 0.006 of MM/GBSA and rp = 0.388 ± 0.006 of MM/PBSA based on the minimized structures); while for the total dataset (1864 crystal structures), the overall best Pearson correlation coefficient (rp = 0.579 ± 0.002) based on MM/GBSA is better than that of MM/PBSA (rp = 0.491 ± 0.003), indicating that biased sampling may significantly affect the accuracy of the predicted result (some protein families contain too many instances and can bias the overall predicted accuracy). Therefore, family based classification is needed to evaluate the two methodologies; (2) the prediction accuracies of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA for different protein families are quite different with rp ranging from 0 to 0.9, whereas the correlation and ranking scores (an averaged rp/rs over a list of protein folds and also representing the unbiased sampling) given by MM/PBSA (rp-score = 0.506 ± 0.050 and rs-score = 0.481 ± 0.052) are comparable to those given by MM/GBSA (rp-score = 0.516 ± 0.047 and rs-score = 0.463 ± 0.047) at the fold family level; (3) for the overall prediction accuracies, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation may not be quite necessary for MM/GBSA (rp-minimized = 0.579 ± 0.002 and rp-1ns = 0.564 ± 0.002), but is needed for MM/PBSA (rp-minimized = 0.412 ± 0.003 and rp-1ns = 0.491 ± 0.003). However, for the individual systems, whether to use MD simulation is depended. (4) both MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA may be unable to give successful predictions for the ligands with high formal charges, with the Pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0.621 ± 0.003 (neutral ligands) to 0.125 ± 0.142 (ligands with a formal charge of 5). Therefore, it can be summarized that, although MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA perform similarly in the unbiased dataset, for the currently available crystal structures in the PDBbind database, compared with MM/GBSA, which may be used in multi-target comparisons, MM/PBSA is more sensitive to the investigated systems, and may be more suitable for individual-target-level binding free energy ranking. This study may provide useful guidance for the post-processing of docking based studies.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of computational techniques and hardware, more rigorous and precise theoretical models have been used to predict the binding affinities of a large number of small molecules to biomolecules. By employing continuum solvation models, the MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA methodologies achieve a good balance between low computational cost and reasonable prediction accuracy. In this study, we have thoroughly investigated the effects of interior dielectric constant, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and the number of top-scored docking poses on the performance of the MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA rescoring of docking poses for three tyrosine kinases, including ABL, ALK, and BRAF. Overall, the MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA rescoring achieved comparative accuracies based on a relatively higher solute (or interior) dielectric constant (i.e. ε = 2, or 4), and could markedly improve the 'screening power' and 'ranking power' given by Autodock. Moreover, with a relatively higher solute dielectric constant, the MM/PBSA or MM/GBSA rescoring based on the best scored docking poses and the multiple top-scored docking poses gave similar predictions, implying that much computational cost can be saved by considering the best scored docking poses only. Besides, compared with the rescoring based on the minimized structures, the rescoring based on the MD simulations might not be completely necessary due to its negligible impact on the docking performance. Considering the much higher computational demand of MM/PBSA, MM/GBSA with a high solute dielectric constant (ε = 2 or 4) is recommended for the virtual screening of tyrosine kinases.",

Based on our simulation results, the following important conclusions can be obtained: (1) for short time-scale MD simulations (1 ns or less), the ff03 force field gives the best predictions by both MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA; (2) for middle time-scale MD simulations (2-4 ns), MM/GBSA based on the ff99 force field yields the best predictions, while MM/PBSA based on the ff99SB force field does the best; however, longer MD simulations, for example, 5 ns or more, may not be quite necessary; (3) for most cases, MM/PBSA with the Tan's parameters shows better ranking capability than MM/GBSA (GB(OBC1)); (4) the RESP charges show the best performance for both MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA, and the AM1-BCC and ESP charges can also give fairly satisfactory predictions.

        "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNN) has been considered as an attractive modelling method for molecular property prediction, and numerous studies have shown that GNN could yield more promising results than traditional descriptor-based methods. In this study, based on 11 public datasets covering various property endpoints, the predictive capacity and computational efficiency of the prediction models developed by eight machine learning (ML) algorithms, including four descriptor-based models (SVM, XGBoost, RF and DNN) and four graph-based models (GCN, GAT, MPNN and Attentive FP), were extensively tested and compared. The results demonstrate that on average the descriptor-based models outperform the graph-based models in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. SVM generally achieves the best predictions for the regression tasks. Both RF and XGBoost can achieve reliable predictions for the classification tasks, and some of the graph-based models, such as Attentive FP and GCN, can yield outstanding performance for a fraction of larger or multi-task datasets. In terms of computational cost, XGBoost and RF are the two most efficient algorithms and only need a few seconds to train a model even for a large dataset. The model interpretations by the SHAP method can effectively explore the established domain knowledge for the descriptor-based models. Finally, we explored use of these models for virtual screening (VS) towards HIV and demonstrated that different ML algorithms offer diverse VS profiles. All in all, we believe that the off-the-shelf descriptor-based models still can be directly employed to accurately predict various chemical endpoints with excellent computability and interpretability.",

The molecular visualization was supported by 3Dmol.js. For the structural modeling of PPIs, HawkDock could achieve a better performance than ZDOCK 3.0.2 in the benchmark testing. For the prediction of key residues, the important residues that play an essential role in PPIs could be identified in the top 10 residues for ∼81.4% predicted models and ∼95.4% crystal structures in the benchmark dataset.

        "abstract": "Understanding protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is quite important to elucidate crucial biological processes and even design compounds that interfere with PPIs with pharmaceutical significance. Protein-protein docking can afford the atomic structural details of protein-protein complexes, but the accurate prediction of the three-dimensional structures for protein-protein systems is still notoriously difficult due in part to the lack of an ideal scoring function for protein-protein docking. Compared with most scoring functions used in protein-protein docking, the Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) and Molecular Mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) methodologies are more theoretically rigorous, but their overall performance for the predictions of binding affinities and binding poses for protein-protein systems has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we first evaluated the performance of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA to predict the binding affinities for 46 protein-protein complexes. On the whole, different force fields, solvation models, and interior dielectric constants have obvious impacts on the prediction accuracy of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA. The MM/GBSA calculations based on the ff02 force field, the GB model developed by Onufriev et al. and a low interior dielectric constant (εin = 1) yield the best correlation between the predicted binding affinities and the experimental data (rp = -0.647), which is better than MM/PBSA (rp = -0.523) and a number of empirical scoring functions used in protein-protein docking (rp = -0.141 to -0.529). Then, we examined the capability of MM/GBSA to identify the possible near-native binding structures from the decoys generated by ZDOCK for 43 protein-protein systems. The results illustrate that the MM/GBSA rescoring has better capability to distinguish the correct binding structures from the decoys than the ZDOCK scoring. Besides, the optimal interior dielectric constant of MM/GBSA for re-ranking docking poses may be determined by analyzing the characteristics of protein-protein binding interfaces. Considering the relatively high prediction accuracy and low computational cost, MM/GBSA may be a good choice for predicting the binding affinities and identifying correct binding structures for protein-protein systems.",

Characterization of the factors that stabilize transition structures in solution and in enzyme active sites provides a basis for design and optimization of catalysts. Continued technological advances allowed for expansion from prototypical cases to mechanistic studies featuring detailed enzyme and condensed-phase environments with full integration of the QM calculations and configurational sampling. This required improved algorithms featuring fast QM methods, advances in computing changes in free energies including free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations, and enhanced configurational sampling. In particular, the present Account highlights development of the PDDG/PM3 semi-empirical QM method, computation of multi-dimensional potentials of mean force (PMF), incorporation of on-the-fly QM in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and a polynomial quadrature method for efficient modeling of proton-transfer reactions. The utility of this QM/MM/MC/FEP methodology is illustrated for a variety of organic reactions including substitution, decarboxylation, elimination, and pericyclic reactions. A comparison to experimental kinetic results on medium effects has verified the accuracy of the QM/MM approach in the full range of solvents from hydrocarbons to water to ionic liquids. Corresponding results from ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) methods with continuum-based treatments of solvation reveal deficiencies, particularly for protic solvents. Also summarized in this Account are three specific QM/MM applications to biomolecular systems: (1) a recent study that clarified the mechanism for the reaction of 2-pyrone derivatives catalyzed by macrophomate synthase as a tandem Michael-aldol sequence rather than a Diels-Alder reaction, (2) elucidation of the mechanism of action of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), an unusual Ser-Ser-Lys proteolytic enzyme, and (3) the construction of enzymes for Kemp elimination of 5-nitrobenzisoxazole that highlights the utility of QM/MM in the design of artificial enzymes.",

In the current work, the binding of amprenavir to both of the wild-type and the drug-resistant V82F/I84V mutant of the HIV-1 protease was investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and was compared to those of two inhibitors in development, TMC126 and TMC114. Absolute binding free energies were calculated by molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/ PBSA) methodology. The predicted binding affinities give a good explanation of structure-affinity relationship (SAR) of three studied inhibitors. Furthermore, in the 18 ns MD simulations on the free wild-type and the mutated proteases, we observed that the free mutated protease shows similar dynamic characteristics of the flap opening and a little higher structural stability than the free wild-type protease. This suggests that the effect of the mutations may not significantly affect the equilibrium between the semiopen and the closed conformations. Finally, decomposition analysis of binding free energies and the further structural analysis indicate that the dominating effect of the V82F/I84V double mutation is to distort the geometry of the binding site and hence weaken the interactions of inhibitors preshaped to the wild-type binding site.",

Each atom in a molecule has its own contribution to aqueous solubility and was developed. Altogether 76 atom types were used to classify atoms with different chemical environments. Moreover, two correction factors, including hydrophobic carbon and square of molecular weight, were used to account for the inter-/intramolecular hydrophobic interactions and bulkiness effect. The contribution coefficients of different atom types and correction factors were generated based on a multiple linear regression using a learning set consisting of 1290 organic compounds. The obtained linear regression model possesses good statistical significance with an overall correlation coefficient (r) of 0.96, a standard deviation (s) of 0.61, and an unsigned mean error (UME) of 0.48. The actual prediction potential of the model was validated through an external test set with 21 pharmaceutically and environmentally interesting compounds. For the test set, a predictive r=0.94, s=0.84, and UME=0.52 were achieved. Comparisons among eight procedures of solubility calculation for those 21 molecules demonstrate that our model bears very good accuracy and is comparable to or even better than most reported techniques based on molecular descriptors. Moreover, we compared the performance of our model to a test set of 120 molecules with a popular group contribution method developed by Klopman et al. For this test set, our model gives a very effective prediction (r=0.96, s=0.79, UME=0.57), which is obviously superior to the predicted results (r=0.96, s=0.84, UME=0.70) given by the Klopman's group contribution approach. Because of the adoption of atoms as the basic units, our addition model does not contain a \"missing fragment\" problem and thus may be more simple and universal than the group contribution models and can give predictions for any organic molecules. A program, drug-LOGS, had been developed to identify the occurrence of atom types and estimate the aqueous solubility of a molecule.",

        "abstract": "Entropy effects play an important role in drug-target interactions, but the entropic contribution to ligand-binding affinity is often neglected by end-point binding free energy calculation methods, such as MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA, due to the expensive computational cost of normal mode analysis (NMA). Here, we systematically investigated entropy effects on the prediction power of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA using >1500 protein-ligand systems and six representative AMBER force fields. Two computationally efficient methods, including NMA based on truncated structures and the interaction entropy approach, were used to estimate the entropic contributions to ligand-target binding free energies. In terms of the overall accuracy, we found that, for the minimized structures, in most cases the inclusion of the conformational entropies predicted by truncated NMA (enthalpynmode_min_9Å) compromises the overall accuracy of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA compared with the enthalpies calculated based on the minimized structures (enthalpymin). However, for the MD trajectories, the binding free energies can be improved by the inclusion of the conformation entropies predicted by either truncated-NMA for a relatively high dielectric constant (εin = 4) or the interaction entropy method for εin = 1-4. In terms of reproducing the absolute binding free energies, the binding free energies estimated by including the truncated-NMA entropies based on the MD trajectories (ΔGnmode_md_9Å) give the lowest average absolute deviations against the experimental data among all the tested strategies for both MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA. Although the inclusion of the truncated NMA based on the MD trajectories (ΔGnmode_md_9Å) for a relatively high dielectric constant gave the overall best result and the lowest average absolute deviations against the experimental data (for the ff03 force field), it needs too much computational time. Alternatively, considering that the interaction entropy method does not incur any additional computational cost and can give comparable (at high dielectric constant, εin = 4) or even better (at low dielectric constant, εin = 1-2) results than the truncated-NMA entropy (ΔGnmode_md_9Å), the interaction entropy approach is recommended to estimate the entropic component for MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA based on MD trajectories, especially for a diverse dataset. Furthermore, we compared the predictions of MM/GBSA with six different AMBER force fields. The results show that the ff03 force field (ff03 for proteins and gaff with AM1-BCC charges for ligands) performs the best, but the predictions given by the tested force fields are comparable, implying that the MM/GBSA predictions are not very sensitive to force fields.",

The correlation analysis between the intestinal absorption and several important molecular properties demonstrated that no single molecular property could be used as a good discriminator to efficiently distinguish the poorly absorbed compounds from those that are well absorbed. The theoretical correlation models for a training set of 455 compounds were proposed by using the genetic function approximation technique. The best prediction model contains four molecular descriptors: topological polar surface area, the predicted distribution coefficient at pH = 6.5, the number of violations of the Lipinski's rule-of-five, and the square of the number of hydrogen-bond donors. The model was able to predict the fractional absorption with an r = 0.84 and a prediction error (absolute mean error) of 11.2% for the training set. Moreover, it achieves an r = 0.90 and a prediction error of 7.8% for a 98-compound test set. The recursive partitioning technique was applied to find the simple hierarchical rules to classify the compounds into poor (%FA < or = 30%) and good (%FA > 30%) intestinal absorption classes. The high quality of the classification model was validated by the satisfactory predictions on the training set (correctly identifying 95.9% of the compounds in the poor-absorption class and 96.1% of the compounds in the good-absorption class) and on the test set (correctly identifying 100% of the compounds in the poor-absorption class and 96.8% of the compounds in the good-absorption class). We expect that, in the future, the rules for the prediction of carrier-mediated transporting and first pass metabolism can be integrated into the current hierarchical rules, and the classification model may become more powerful in the prediction of intestinal absorption or even human bioavailability.

        "abstract": "The correlations between Caco-2 permeability (logPapp) and molecular properties have been investigated. A training set of 77 structurally diverse organic molecules was used to construct significant QSAR models for Caco-2 cell permeation. Cellular permeation was found to depend primarily upon experimental distribution coefficient (logD) at pH = 7.4, high charged polar surface area (HCPSA), and radius of gyration (rgyr). Among these three descriptors, logD may have the largest impact on diffusion through Caco-2 cell because logD shows obvious linear correlation with logPapp (r=0.703) when logD is smaller than 2.0. High polar surface area will be unfavorable to achieve good Caco-2 permeability because higher polar surface area will introduce stronger H-bonding interactions between Caco-2 cells and drugs. The comparison among HCPSA, PSA (polar surface area), and TPSA (topological polar surface area) implies that high-charged atoms may be more important to the interactions between Caco-2 cell and drugs. Besides logD and HCPSA, rgyr is also closely connected with Caco-2 permeabilities. The molecules with larger rgyr are more difficult to cross Caco-2 monolayers than those with smaller rgyr. The descriptors included in the prediction models permit the interpretation in structural terms of the passive permeability process, evidencing the main role of lipholiphicity, H-bonding, and bulk properties. Besides these three molecular descriptors, the influence of other molecular descriptors was also investigated. From the calculated results, it can be found that introducing descriptors concerned with molecular flexibility can improve the linear correlation. The resulting model with four descriptors bears good statistical significance, n = 77, r = 0.82, q = 0.79, s = 0.45, F = 35.7. The actual predictive abilities of the QSAR model were validated through an external validation test set of 23 diverse compounds. The predictions for the tested compounds are as the same accuracy as the compounds of the training set and significantly better than those predicted by using the model reported. The good predictive ability suggests that the proposed model may be a good tool for fast screening of logPapp for compound libraries or large sets of new chemical entities via combinatorial chemistry synthesis.",

The use of smart computational methods in the life cycle of drug design is relatively a recent development that has gained much popularity and interest over the last few years. Central to this methodology is the notion of computational docking which is the process of predicting the best pose (orientation + conformation) of a small molecule (drug candidate) when bound to a target larger receptor molecule (protein) in order to form a stable complex molecule. In computational docking, a large number of binding poses are evaluated and ranked using a scoring function. The scoring function is a mathematical predictive model that produces a score that represents the binding free energy, and hence the stability, of the resulting complex molecule. Generally, such a function should produce a set of plausible ligands ranked according to their binding stability along with their binding poses. In more practical terms, an effective scoring function should produce promising drug candidates which can then be synthesized and physically screened using high throughput screening process. Therefore, the key to computer-aided drug design is the design of an efficient highly accurate scoring function (using ML techniques).",

We developed generic MIEC-SVM models to infer SH3 domain-peptide recognition specificity that achieved satisfactory prediction accuracy. By investigating the domain-peptide recognition mechanisms at the residue level, we found that the class-I and class-II binding peptides have different binding modes even though they occupy the same binding site of SH3. Furthermore, we predicted the potential binding partners of SH3 domains in the yeast proteome and constructed the SH3-mediated protein-protein interaction network. Comparison with the experimentally determined interactions confirmed the effectiveness of our approach. This study showed that our sophisticated computational approach not only provides a powerful platform to decipher protein recognition code at the molecular level but also allows identification of peptide-mediated protein interactions at a proteomic scale.

        "abstract": "Many important protein-protein interactions are mediated by peptide recognition modular domains, such as the Src homology 3 (SH3), SH2, PDZ, and WW domains. Characterizing the interaction interface of domain-peptide complexes and predicting binding specificity for modular domains are critical for deciphering protein-protein interaction networks. Here, we propose the use of an energetic decomposition analysis to characterize domain-peptide interactions and the molecular interaction energy components (MIECs), including van der Waals, electrostatic, and desolvation energy between residue pairs on the binding interface. We show a proof-of-concept study on the amphiphysin-1 SH3 domain interacting with its peptide ligands. The structures of the human amphiphysin-1 SH3 domain complexed with 884 peptides were first modeled using virtual mutagenesis and optimized by molecular mechanics (MM) minimization. Next, the MIECs between domain and peptide residues were computed using the MM/generalized Born decomposition analysis. We conducted two types of statistical analyses on the MIECs to demonstrate their usefulness for predicting binding affinities of peptides and for classifying peptides into binder and non-binder categories. First, combining partial least squares analysis and genetic algorithm, we fitted linear regression models between the MIECs and the peptide binding affinities on the training data set. These models were then used to predict binding affinities for peptides in the test data set; the predicted values have a correlation coefficient of 0.81 and an unsigned mean error of 0.39 compared with the experimentally measured ones. The partial least squares-genetic algorithm analysis on the MIECs revealed the critical interactions for the binding specificity of the amphiphysin-1 SH3 domain. Next, a support vector machine (SVM) was employed to build classification models based on the MIECs of peptides in the training set. A rigorous training-validation procedure was used to assess the performances of different kernel functions in SVM and different combinations of the MIECs. The best SVM classifier gave satisfactory predictions for the test set, indicated by average prediction accuracy rates of 78% and 91% for the binding and non-binding peptides, respectively. We also showed that the performance of our approach on both binding affinity prediction and binder/non-binder classification was superior to the performances of the conventional MM/Poisson-Boltzmann solvent-accessible surface area and MM/generalized Born solvent-accessible surface area calculations. Our study demonstrates that the analysis of the MIECs between peptides and the SH3 domain can successfully characterize the binding interface, and it provides a framework to derive integrated prediction models for different domain-peptide systems.",

We showed that the percentages of compounds meeting the criteria based on molecular properties does not distinguish compounds with poor oral bioavailability from those with acceptable values, which may suggest that no simple rule based on molecular properties can be used as general filters to predict oral bioavailability with high confidence. A data set of intestinal absorption was also examined and compared with that of oral bioavailability. The performance of these rules based on molecular properties in the prediction of intestinal absorption is obviously much better than that of oral bioavailability in term of false positive rate, and, therefore, the applications of the \"rule-based\" approaches on the prediction of human bioavailability should be very cautious.",

An efficient sampling strategy has been proposed and tested in the calculation of the diffusion coefficients of solutes in solutions. There are two major findings of this study. First of all, the diffusion coefficients of organic solutes in aqueous solution can be well predicted: the average unsigned errors and the root mean square errors are 0.137 and 0.171 × 10(-5) cm(-2) s(-1), respectively. Second, although the absolute values of D cannot be predicted, good correlations have been achieved for eight organic solvents with experimental data (R(2) = 0.784), four proteins in aqueous solutions (R(2) = 0.996), and nine organic compounds in nonaqueous solutions (R(2) = 0.834).

It is important but challenging to determine the binding specificity of these domains accurately and to predict their physiological interacting partners. In this study, the interactions between 35 peptide ligands (15 binders and 20 non-binders) and the Abl SH3 domain were analyzed using molecular dynamics simulation and the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Solvent Area method. The calculated binding free energies correlated well with the rank order of the binding peptides and clearly distinguished binders from non-binders. Free energy component analysis revealed that the van der Waals interactions dictate the binding strength of peptides, whereas the binding specificity is determined by the electrostatic interaction and the polar contribution of desolvation. The binding motif of the Abl SH3 domain was then determined by a virtual mutagenesis method, which mutates the residue at each position of the template peptide relative to all other 19 amino acids and calculates the binding free energy difference between the template and the mutated peptides using the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Solvent Area method. A single position mutation free energy profile was thus established and used as a scoring matrix to search peptides recognized by the Abl SH3 domain in the human genome. Our approach successfully picked ten out of 13 experimentally determined binding partners of the Abl SH3 domain among the top 600 candidates from the 218,540 decapeptides with the PXXP motif in the SWISS-PROT database.

The best model is based on three descriptors: n-octanol/water partition coefficient calculated using the SLOGP approach, logP; high-charged polar surface areas based on the Gasteiger partial charges, HCPSA, and the excessive molecular weight larger than 360, MW(360). The model bears good statistical significance, n = 78, r = 0.88, q = 0.86, s = 0.36, F = 81.5. The actual prediction potential of the model was validated through two external validation sets of 37 diverse compounds. The predicted results demonstrate that the model bears better prediction potential than many other models and can be used for logBB estimations for drug and drug-like molecules. Comparison of several logP calculation approaches suggests that logP calculated by SLOGP can be used as a significant descriptor for the prediction of molecular transport properties because SLOGP gives the most similar results with CLOGP. The QSPR model indicates that larger polar surface areas have a more negative contribution to logBB, but the absolute partial charges on the atoms surrounded by the polar surfaces should be larger than 0.10|e|. Meanwhile, tight junction membranes limit the size of hydrophilic molecules that can cross the membrane with a molecular weight of approximately 360, because when a molecule's weight is larger than 360 it shows a negative contribution to logBB. The computations of molecular surface, partial charges, logP, and logBB have been accomplished using a program called Drug-BB. Moreover, to improve the efficiency of the computations of logP, we made an extensive reparametrization of SLOGP, and the newly developed SLOGP model is only based on simple atomic addition. Further, we developed a set of parameters to calculate the topological polar surface area (TPSA), thus the high-charged topological polar surface area (HCTPSA) could be estimated from the 2D connection information of a molecule. Adopting the new strategies, the estimations of logP, HCTPSA, and logBB are only based on the topological structure of a molecule and therefore, can be used for fast screening of virtual libraries having millions of molecules.",

MPAD, a metric of molecular polarization anisotropy difference based on the diagonal terms of molecular polarizability tensors was defined and applied to assess the polarizable models in reproducing the ab initio molecular polarization anisotropy. The MPADs are 3.71, 4.70, 4.11, and 4.77% for the pGM, Thole linear, Thole exponential, and Thole Amoeba USF models, respectively. The APEs are reduced further to 2.85, 3.58, 2.90, and 3.15% for the four corresponding VSF models. Thus, the new pGM and Thole models notably improve molecular polarization anisotropy. Since pGM attenuates all short-range electrostatic interactions, its application is expected to improve stability in charge fitting, energy, and force calculations and the accuracy of multibody polarization.",

The development of in silico tools to filter out potential hERG potassium channel blockers in early stages of the drug discovery process is of considerable interest. Here, a diverse set of 806 compounds with hERG inhibition data was assembled, and the binary hERG classification models using naive Bayesian classification and recursive partitioning (RP) techniques were established and evaluated. The naive Bayesian classifier based on molecular properties and the ECFP_8 fingerprints yielded 84.8% accuracy for the training set using the leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation procedure and 85% accuracy for the test set of 120 molecules. For the two additional test sets, the model achieved 89.4% accuracy for the WOMBAT-PK test set, and 86.1% accuracy for the PubChem test set. The naive Bayesian classifiers gave better predictions than the RP classifiers.

        "abstract": "Molecular mechanical force field (FF) methods are useful in studying condensed phase properties. They are complementary to experiment and can often go beyond experiment in atomic details. Even a FF is specific for studying structures, dynamics and functions of biomolecules, it is still important for the FF to accurately reproduce the experimental liquid properties of small molecules that represent the chemical moieties of biomolecules. Otherwise, the force field may not describe the structures and energies of macromolecules in aqueous solutions properly. In this work, we have carried out a systematic study to evaluate the General AMBER Force Field (GAFF) in studying densities and heats of vaporization for a large set of organic molecules that covers the most common chemical functional groups. The latest techniques, such as the particle mesh Ewald (PME) for calculating electrostatic energies, and Langevin dynamics for scaling temperatures, have been applied in the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For density, the average percent error (APE) of 71 organic compounds is 4.43% when compared to the experimental values. More encouragingly, the APE drops to 3.43% after the exclusion of two outliers and four other compounds for which the experimental densities have been measured with pressures higher than 1.0 atm. For heat of vaporization, several protocols have been investigated and the best one, P4/ntt0, achieves an average unsigned error (AUE) and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.93 and 1.20 kcal/mol, respectively. How to reduce the prediction errors through proper van der Waals (vdW) parameterization has been discussed. An encouraging finding in vdW parameterization is that both densities and heats of vaporization approach their \"ideal\" values in a synchronous fashion when vdW parameters are tuned. The following hydration free energy calculation using thermodynamic integration further justifies the vdW refinement. We conclude that simple vdW parameterization can significantly reduce the prediction errors. We believe that GAFF can greatly improve its performance in predicting liquid properties of organic molecules after a systematic vdW parameterization, which will be reported in a separate paper.",

Methods: Rather than giving detailed descriptions of the ADME prediction models, we focus on the discussions of the prediction accuracies of the in silico models.

        "abstract": "Human intestinal absorption (HIA) is an important roadblock in the formulation of new drug substances. In silico models for predicting the percentage of HIA based on calculated molecular descriptors are highly needed for the rapid estimation of this property. Here, we have studied the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) to classify compounds with high or low fractional absorption (%FA > 30% or %FA < or = 30%). The analyzed data set consists of 578 structural diverse druglike molecules, which have been divided into a 480-molecule training set and a 98-molecule test set. Ten SVM classification models have been generated to investigate the impact of different individual molecular properties on %FA. Among these studied important molecule descriptors, topological polar surface area (TPSA) and predicted apparent octanol-water distribution coefficient at pH 6.5 (logD6.5) show better classification performance than the others. To obtain the best SVM classifier, the influences of different kernel functions and different combinations of molecular descriptors were investigated using a rigorous training-validation procedure. The best SVM classifier can give satisfactory predictions for the training set (97.8% for the poor-absorption class and 94.5% for the good-absorption class). Moreover, 100% of the poor-absorption class and 97.8% of the good-absorption class in the external test set could be correctly classified. Finally, the influence of the size of the training set and the unbalanced nature of the data set have been studied. The analysis demonstrates that large data set is necessary for the stability of the classification models. Furthermore, the weights for the poor-absorption class and the good-absorption class should be properly balanced to generate unbiased classification models. Our work illustrates that SVMs used in combination with simple molecular descriptors can provide an extremely reliable assessment of intestinal absorption in an early in silico filtering process.",

Compared to traditional photocatalysts, GeS and GeSe possess a large intrinsic dipole and introduce an internal electric field directing from Ge surface to S/Se surface, which causes notable band bending. The band bending means they possess favorable band positions located outside the reduction potential and oxidation potential of water, overcoming the restriction of their band gaps.

It is related to absorption and distribution in the ADME-Tox (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity). Aqueous solubility and membrane permeability are the two key factors that affect a drug's oral bioavailability. Because of the importance of aqueous solubility, a lot of efforts have been spent on developing reliable models to predict this physiochemical property. Although some progress has been made and a lot of models have been constructed, it is concluded that accurate and reliable aqueous models targeted to predict solubility of drug-like molecules, have not emerged based on the outcome of an aqueous solubility prediction campaign sponsored by Goodman et al. In this review paper, we provide a snapshot of the latest development in the field. The challenges of developing high quality aqueous solubility models as well as the strategies of surmounting those challenges have been discussed. We conclude that the biggest challenge of modeling aqueous solubility is to collect more high quality, unskewed and drug-relevant solubility data which are sufficient diverse to cover most the chemical space of drugs. The second challenge is to develop good descriptors to account for the lattice energy of solvation. In order to develop accurate and predictable in silico solubility models, the key is to collect a sufficient number of high quality experimental data and the suspicious data must be verified. In addition, the molecular descriptors must be relevant to the energies in the solvation process (the lattice energy for crystal packing, the energy of forming cavity in solvent, and the solvation energy), and the models must be carefully cross-validated and evaluated using the external data sets.",

In the present work, we report a database of oral bioavailability of 1014 molecules determined in humans. A systematic examination of the relationships between various physicochemical properties and oral bioavailability were carried out to investigate the influence of these properties on oral bioavailability. A number of property-based rules for bioavailability classification were generated and evaluated. We found that no rule was an effective predictor for oral bioavailability because these simple rules cannot characterize the influence of important metabolic processes on bioavailability. Finally, the genetic function approximation (GFA) technique was employed to construct the multiple linear regression models for oral bioavailability using structural fingerprints as the basic parameters, together with several important molecular properties. The best model is able to predict human oral bioavailability with an r of 0.79, a q of 0.72, and a RMSE (root-mean-square error) of 22.30% of the compounds from the training set. The analysis of the descriptors chosen by GFA shows that the important structural fingerprints are primarily related to important intestinal absorption and well-known metabolic processes. The predictive power of the models was further evaluated using a separate test set of 80 compounds, and the consensus model can predict the oral bioavailability with r(test) = 0.71 and RMSE = 23.55% for the tested compounds. Since the necessary molecular properties and structural fingerprints can be calculated easily and quickly, the models we proposed here may help speed up the process of finding or designing compounds with improved oral bioavailability.",

For ASMS (without using ClogP as a descriptor), the leave-one-out q(2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were 0.872 and 0.748 log unit, respectively. ASMS-LOGP was slightly better than ASMS (q(2) = 0.886, RMSE = 0.705). Both models were extensively validated by three cross-validation tests and encouraging predictability was achieved. High throughput aqueous solubility prediction was conducted for a number of data sets extracted from several widely used databases. We found that real drugs are about 20-fold more soluble than the so-called druglike molecules in the ZINC database, which have no violation of Lipinski's \"Rule of 5\" at all. Specifically, oral drugs are about 16-fold more soluble, while injection drugs are 50-60-fold more soluble. If the criterion of a molecule to be soluble is set to -5 log unit, about 85% of real drugs are predicted as soluble; in contrast only 50% of druglike molecules in ZINC are soluble.

In IGN, two independent graph convolution modules were stacked to sequentially learn the intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, and the learned intermolecular interactions can be efficiently used for subsequent tasks. Extensive binding affinity prediction, large-scale structure-based virtual screening, and pose prediction experiments demonstrated that IGN achieved better or competitive performance against other state-of-the-art ML-based baselines and docking programs.

Recently, the most stable surface structures of CH3NH3PbX3 have been successfully characterized by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with the high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results. The two coexisting phases of the perovskite surfaces have been ascribed to the alternate orientation of the methylammonium (MA) cations. Notably, similar surface defect images (a dark depression at the sites of X atoms) have been observed on surfaces produced with various experimental methods. As such, these defects are expected to be intrinsic to the perovskite crystals and may play an important role in the structural decomposition of perovskite materials. Understanding the nature of such defects should provide some useful information toward understanding the instability of perovskite materials. Thus, we investigate the chemical identity of the surface defects systematically with first-principles density functional theory calculations and STM simulations. The calculated STM images of the Br and Br-MA vacancies are both in good agreement with the experimental measurements. In vacuum conditions, the formation energy of Br-MA is 0.43 eV less than the Br vacancy. In the presence of solvation effects, however, the formation energy of a Br vacancy becomes 0.42 eV lower than the Br-MA vacancy. In addition, at the vacancy sites, the adsorption energies of water, oxygen, and acetonitrile molecules are significantly higher than those on the pristine surfaces. This clearly demonstrated that the structural decomposition of perovskites are much easier to start from these vacancy sites than the pristine surfaces. Combining DFT calculations and STM simulations, this work reveals the chemical identities of the intrinsic defects in the CH3NH3PbX3 perovskite crystals and their effects on the stability of perovskite materials.",

In this study, we first identified residues that have significant contributions to binding with six substrates using molecular dynamics simulations and Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area calculations. Among the critical residues, Asp25, Gly27, Ala28, Asp29, and Gly49 are well conserved, with which the potent drugs should form strong interactions. We then calculated the contribution of each residue to binding with eight FDA approved drugs. We analyzed the conservation of each protease residue and also compared the interaction between the HIV protease and individual residues of the drugs and substrates. Our analyses showed that resistant mutations usually occur at less conserved residues forming more favorable interactions with drugs than with substrates. To quantitatively integrate the binding free energy and conservation information, we defined an empirical parameter called free energy/variability (FV) value, which is the product of the contribution of a single residue to the binding free energy and the sequence variability at that position. As a validation, the FV value was shown to identify single resistant mutations with an accuracy of 88%.

        "abstract": "Extensive efforts have been devoted to determining the binding specificity of Src homology 3 (SH3) domains usually in a case-by-case manner. A generic structure-based model is necessary to decipher the protein recognition code of the entire domain family. In this study, we have developed a general framework that combines molecular modeling and a machine learning algorithm to capture the energetic characteristics of the domain-peptide interactions and predict the binding specificity of the SH3 domain family. Our model is not trained for individual SH3 domains; rather it is a generic model for the entire domain family. Our model not only achieved satisfactory prediction accuracy but also provided structural insights into which residues are important for the binding specificity. The success of our framework on SH3 domains suggests that it is possible to establish a theoretical model to decipher the protein recognition code of any modular domain.",

        "title": "Develop and test a solvent accessible surface area-based model in conformational entropy calculations",
        "abstract": "great interest in modern drug design to accurately calculate the free energies of protein-ligand or nucleic acid-ligand binding. MM-PBSA (molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area) and MM-GBSA (molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area) have gained popularity in this field. For both methods, the conformational entropy, which is usually calculated through normal-mode analysis (NMA), is needed to calculate the absolute binding free energies. Unfortunately, NMA is computationally demanding and becomes a bottleneck of the MM-PB/GBSA-NMA methods. In this work, we have developed a fast approach to estimate the conformational entropy based upon solvent accessible surface area calculations. In our approach, the conformational entropy of a molecule, S, can be obtained by summing up the contributions of all atoms, no matter they are buried or exposed. Each atom has two types of surface areas, solvent accessible surface area (SAS) and buried SAS (BSAS). The two types of surface areas are weighted to estimate the contribution of an atom to S. Atoms having the same atom type share the same weight and a general parameter k is applied to balance the contributions of the two types of surface areas. This entropy model was parametrized using a large set of small molecules for which their conformational entropies were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level taking the solvent effect into account. The weighted solvent accessible surface area (WSAS) model was extensively evaluated in three tests. For convenience, TS values, the product of temperature T and conformational entropy S, were calculated in those tests. T was always set to 298.15 K through the text. First of all, good correlations were achieved between WSAS TS and NMA TS for 44 protein or nucleic acid systems sampled with molecular dynamics simulations (10 snapshots were collected for postentropy calculations): the mean correlation coefficient squares (R²) was 0.56. As to the 20 complexes, the TS changes upon binding; TΔS values were also calculated, and the mean R² was 0.67 between NMA and WSAS. In the second test, TS values were calculated for 12 proteins decoy sets (each set has 31 conformations) generated by the Rosetta software package. Again, good correlations were achieved for all decoy sets: the mean, maximum, and minimum of R² were 0.73, 0.89, and 0.55, respectively. Finally, binding free energies were calculated for 6 protein systems (the numbers of inhibitors range from 4 to 18) using four scoring functions. Compared to the measured binding free energies, the mean R² of the six protein systems were 0.51, 0.47, 0.40, and 0.43 for MM-GBSA-WSAS, MM-GBSA-NMA, MM-PBSA-WSAS, and MM-PBSA-NMA, respectively. The mean rms errors of prediction were 1.19, 1.24, 1.41, 1.29 kcal/mol for the four scoring functions, correspondingly. Therefore, the two scoring functions employing WSAS achieved a comparable prediction performance to that of the scoring functions using NMA. It should be emphasized that no minimization was performed prior to the WSAS calculation in the last test. Although WSAS is not as rigorous as physical models such as quasi-harmonic analysis and thermodynamic integration (TI), it is computationally very efficient as only surface area calculation is involved and no structural minimization is required. Moreover, WSAS has achieved a comparable performance to normal-mode analysis. We expect that this model could find its applications in the fields like high throughput screening (HTS), molecular docking, and rational protein design. In those fields, efficiency is crucial since there are a large number of compounds, docking poses, or protein models to be evaluated.

        "abstract": "P-glycoprotein (P-gp) actively transports a wide variety of chemically diverse compounds out of cells. It is highly associated with the ADMET properties of drugs and drug candidates and, moreover, plays a major role in the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenomenon, which leads to the failure of chemotherapy in cancer treatments. Therefore, the recognition of potential P-gp substrates at the early stages of the drug discovery process is quite important. Here, we compiled an extensive data set containing 423 P-gp substrates and 399 nonsubstrates, which is the largest P-gp substrate/nonsubstrate data set yet published. Comparison of the distributions of eight important physicochemical properties for the substrates and nonsubstrates reveals that molecular weight and molecular solubility are the informative attributes differentiating P-gp substrates from nonsubstrates. Examination of the distributions of eight physicochemical properties for 735 P-gp inhibitors and 423 substrates gives the fact that inhibitors are significantly more hydrophobic than substrates while substrates tend to have more H-bond donors than inhibitors. Then, the classification models based on simple molecular properties, topological descriptors, and molecular fingerprints were developed using the naive Bayesian classification technique. The best naive Bayesian classifier yields a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.824 and a prediction accuracy of 91.2% for the training set from a 5-fold cross-validation procedure, and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.667 and a prediction accuracy of 83.5% for the test set containing 200 molecules. Analysis of the important structural fragments given by the Bayesian classifier shows that the essential H-bond acceptors arranged in distinct spatial patterns and flexibility are quite essential for P-gp substrate-likeness, which affords a deeper understanding on the molecular basis of substrate/P-gp interaction. Finally, the reasons for mispredictions were discussed. It turns out that the presented classifier could be used as a reliable virtual screening tool for identifying potential substrates of P-gp.",

        "abstract": "Although a wide variety of machine learning (ML) algorithms have been utilized to learn quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs), there is no agreed single best algorithm for QSAR learning. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the performance characteristics of popular ML algorithms used in QSAR learning is highly desirable. In this study, five linear algorithms [linear function Gaussian process regression (linear-GPR), linear function support vector machine (linear-SVM), partial least squares regression (PLSR), multiple linear regression (MLR) and principal component regression (PCR)], three analogizers [radial basis function support vector machine (rbf-SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and radial basis function Gaussian process regression (rbf-GPR)], six symbolists [extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), Cubist, random forest (RF), multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and classification and regression tree (CART)] and two connectionists [principal component analysis artificial neural network (pca-ANN) and deep neural network (DNN)] were employed to learn the regression-based QSAR models for 14 public data sets comprising nine physicochemical properties and five toxicity endpoints. The results show that rbf-SVM, rbf-GPR, XGBoost and DNN generally illustrate better performances than the other algorithms. The overall performances of different algorithms can be ranked from the best to the worst as follows: rbf-SVM > XGBoost > rbf-GPR > Cubist > GBM > DNN > RF > pca-ANN > MARS > linear-GPR ≈ KNN > linear-SVM ≈ PLSR > CART ≈ PCR ≈ MLR. In terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, SVM and XGBoost are recommended to the regression learning for small data sets, and XGBoost is an excellent choice for large data sets. We then investigated the performances of the ensemble models by integrating the predictions of multiple ML algorithms. The results illustrate that the ensembles of two or three algorithms in different categories can indeed improve the predictions of the best individual ML algorithms.",

Nowadays, as a powerful computation tool, molecular docking has been widely utilized to predict the binding structures of protein-peptide complexes. However, although a number of docking programs have been available, the systematic study on the assessment of their performance for PpIs has never been reported. In this study, a benchmark data set called PepSet consisting of 185 protein-peptide complexes with peptide length ranging from 5 to 20 residues was employed to evaluate the performance of 14 docking programs, including three protein-protein docking programs (ZDOCK, FRODOCK, and HawkDock), three small molecule docking programs (GOLD, Surflex-Dock, and AutoDock Vina), and eight protein-peptide docking programs (GalaxyPepDock, MDockPeP, HPEPDOCK, CABS-dock, pepATTRACT, DINC, AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP), and HADDOCK peptide docking). A new evaluation parameter, named IL_RMSD, was proposed to measure the docking accuracy with fnat (the fraction of native contacts). In global docking, HPEPDOCK performs the best for the entire data set and yields the success rates of 4.3%, 24.3%, and 55.7% at the top 1, 10, and 100 levels, respectively. In local docking, overall, ADCP achieves the best predictions and reaches the success rates of 11.9%, 37.3%, and 70.3% at the top 1, 10, and 100 levels, respectively. It is expected that our work can provide some helpful insights into the selection and development of improved docking programs for PpIs.

Implantation of biomaterial scaffolds and stem cells has been demonstrated to be a promising strategy. However, a comprehensive recovery effect is difficult to achieve. In the comprehensive treatment process, the specific roles of the implanted scaffolds and of stem cells in combined strategy are usually neglected. In this study, a peptide-modified scaffold is developed based on hyaluronic acid and an adhesive peptide PPFLMLLKGSTR. Synchrotron radiation micro computed tomography measurement provides insights to the three-dimensional inner topographical property and perspective porous structure of the scaffold. The modified scaffold significantly improves cellular survival and adhesive growth of mesenchymal stem cells during 3D culture in vitro. After implantation in transected spinal cord, the modified scaffold and mesenchymal stems are found to function in synergy to restore injured spinal cord tissue, with respective strengths. Hindlimb motor function scores exhibit the most significant impact of the composite implant at 2 weeks post injury, which is the time secondary injury factors begin to take hold. Investigation on the secondary injury factors including inflammatory response and astrocyte overactivity at 10 days post injury reveals the possible underlying reason. Implants of the scaffold, cells, and especially the combination of both elicit inhibitory effects on these adverse factors. The study develops a promising implant for spinal cord tissue engineering and reveals the roles of the scaffold and stem cells. More importantly, the results provide the first understanding of the bioactive peptide PPFLMLLKGSTR concerning its functions on mesenchymal stem cells and spinal cord tissue restoration.",

In this study, pharmacophore modeling and machine learning approaches were combined to construct classification models to distinguish hERG active from inactive compounds based on a diverse data set. First, an optimal ensemble of pharmacophore hypotheses that had good capability to differentiate hERG active from inactive compounds was identified by the recursive partitioning (RP) approach. Then, the naive Bayesian classification (NBC) and support vector machine (SVM) approaches were employed to construct classification models by integrating multiple important pharmacophore hypotheses. The integrated classification models showed improved predictive capability over any single pharmacophore hypothesis, suggesting that the broad binding polyspecificity of hERG can only be well characterized by multiple pharmacophores. The best SVM model achieved the prediction accuracies of 84.7% for the training set and 82.1% for the external test set. Notably, the accuracies for the hERG blockers and nonblockers in the test set reached 83.6% and 78.2%, respectively. Analysis of significant pharmacophores helps to understand the multimechanisms of action of hERG blockers. We believe that the combination of pharmacophore modeling and SVM is a powerful strategy to develop reliable theoretical models for the prediction of potential hERG liability.",

First, for each target, the representative crystal structures were selected by structural clustering, and the capability of molecular docking based on each representative structure to discriminate inhibitors from non-inhibitors was examined. Then, for each target, 50 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to generate an ensemble of the conformations, and multiple representative structures/snapshots were extracted from each MD trajectory by structural clustering. On average, the representative crystal structures outperform the representative structures extracted from MD simulations in terms of the capabilities to separate inhibitors from non-inhibitors. Finally, by using the naïve Bayesian classification technique, an integrated VS strategy was developed to combine the prediction results of molecular docking based on different representative conformations chosen from crystal structures and MD trajectories. It was encouraging to observe that the integrated VS strategy yields better performance than the docking-based VS based on any single rigid conformation. This novel protocol may provide an improvement over existing strategies to search for more diverse and promising active compounds for a target of interest.",

For this purpose, the theoretical models for drug-likeness to discriminate between drug-like and non-drug-like based on molecular physicochemical properties and structural fingerprints were developed by using the naive Bayesian classification (NBC) and recursive partitioning (RP) techniques, and then the drug-likeness of the compounds from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Compound Database (TCMCD) was evaluated. First, the impact of molecular physicochemical properties and structural fingerprints on the prediction accuracy of drug-likeness was examined. We found that, compared with simple molecular properties, structural fingerprints were more essential for the accurate prediction of drug-likeness. Then, a variety of Bayesian classifiers were constructed by changing the ratio of drug-like to non-drug-like molecules and the size of the training set. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy of the Bayesian classifiers was closely related to the size and the degree of the balance of the training set. When a balanced training set was used, the best Bayesian classifier based on 21 physicochemical properties and the LCFP_6 fingerprint set yielded an overall leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validated accuracy of 91.4% for the 140,000 molecules in the training set and 90.9% for the 40,000 molecules in the test set. In addition, the RP classifiers with different maximum depth were constructed and compared with the Bayesian classifiers, and we found that the best Bayesian classifier outperformed the best RP model with respect to overall prediction accuracy. Moreover, the Bayesian classifier employing structural fingerprints highlights the important substructures favorable or unfavorable for drug-likeness, offering extra valuable information for getting high quality lead compounds in the early stage of the drug design/discovery process. Finally, the best Bayesian classifier was used to predict the drug-likeness of 33,961 compounds in TCMCD. Our calculations show that 59.37% of the molecules in TCMCD were identified as drug-like molecules, indicating that traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) are therefore an excellent source of drug-like molecules. Furthermore, the important structural fingerprints in TCMCD were detected and analyzed. Considering that the pharmacology of TCMCD and MDDR (MDL Drug Data Report) was linked by the important common structural features, the potential pharmacology of the compounds in TCMCD may therefore be annotated by these important structural signatures identified from Bayesian analysis, which may be valuable to promote the development of TCMs.",

These compounds belonging to six different structural classes were randomly divided into a training set of 122 compounds and a test set of 13 compounds. The statistical results showed that the 3D-QSAR models derived from CoMFA were superior to those generated from CoMSIA. The most optimal CoMFA model after region focusing bears significant cross-validated r(2)(cv) of 0.60 and conventional r(2) of 0.92. The predictive power of the best CoMFA model was further validated by the accurate estimation to these compounds in the external test set, and the mean agreement of experimental and predicted log(IC(50)) values of the inhibitors is 0.6 log unit. Separate CoMFA models were conducted to evaluate the influence of different partial charges (Gasteiger-Marsili, Gasteiger-Hückel, MMFF94, ESP-AM1, and MPA-AM1) on the statistical quality of the models. The resulting CoMFA field map provides information on the geometry of the binding site cavity and the relative weights of various properties in different site pockets for each of the substrates considered. Moreover, in the current work, we applied MD simulations combined with MM/PBSA (Molecular mechanics/Possion-Boltzmann Surface Area) to determine the correct binding mode of the best inhibitor for which no ligand-protein crystal structure was present. To proceed, we define the following procedure: three hundred picosecond molecular dynamics simulations were first performed for the four binding modes suggested by DOCK 4.0 and manual docking, and then MM/PBSA was carried out for the collected snapshots. The most favorable binding mode identified by MM/PBSA has a binding free energy about 10 kcal/mol more favorable than the second best one. The most favorable binding mode identified by MM/PBSA can give satisfactory explanation of the SAR data of the studied molecules and is in good agreement with the contour maps of CoMFA. The most favorable binding mode suggests that with the quinazoline-based inhibitor, the N3 atom is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule which, in turn, interacts with Thr 766, not Thr 830 as proposed by Wissner et al. (J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 3244). The predicted complex structure of quinazoline type inhibitor with EGF-R as well as the pharmacophore mapping from CoMFA can interpret the structure activities of the inhibitors well and afford us important information for structure-based drug design.",

Therefore, accurate prediction of the inhibition capability of a given compound against a specific CYP450 isoform is highly desirable. In this study, three ensemble learning methods, including random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and two deep learning methods, including deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), were used to develop classification models to discriminate inhibitors and non-inhibitors for five major CYP450 isoforms (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4). The results demonstrate that the ensemble learning models generally give better predictions than the deep learning models for the external test sets. Among all the models, the XGBoost models achieve the best classification capability (average prediction accuracy of 90.4%) for the test sets, which even outperform the previously reported model developed by multitask deep autoencoder neural network (88.5%). The Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method was then used to interpret the models and analyze the misclassified molecules. The important molecular descriptors given by our models are consistent with the structural preferences for inhibitors of different CYP450 isoforms, which may provide valuable clues to detect potential drug-drug interactions in early stage of drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "A significant number of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are mediated through the interactions between proteins and peptide segments, and therefore determination of protein-peptide interactions (PpIs) is critical to gain an in-depth understanding of the PPI network and even design peptides or small molecules capable of modulating PPIs. Computational approaches, especially molecular docking, provide an efficient way to model PpIs, and a reliable scoring function that can recognize the correct binding conformations for protein-peptide complexes is one of the most important components in protein-peptide docking. The end-point binding free energy calculation methods, such as MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA, are theoretically more rigorous than most empirical and semi-empirical scoring functions designed for protein-peptide docking, but their performance in predicting binding affinities and binding poses for protein-peptide systems has not been systematically assessed. In this study, we first evaluated the capability of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA with different solvation models, interior dielectric constants (εin) and force fields to predict the binding affinities for 53 protein-peptide complexes. For the 19 short peptides with 5-12 residues, MM/PBSA based on the minimized structures in explicit solvent with the ff99 force field and εin = 2 yields the best correlation between the predicted binding affinities and the experimental data (rp = 0.748), while for the 34 medium-size peptides with 20-25 residues, MM/GBSA based on 1 ns of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in implicit solvent with the ff03 force field, the GBOBC1 model and a low interior dielectric constant (εin = 1) yields the best accuracy (rp = 0.735). Then, we assessed the rescoring capability of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA to distinguish the correct binding conformations from the decoys for 112 protein-peptide systems. The results illustrate that MM/PBSA based on the minimized structures with the ff99 or ff14SB force field and MM/GBSA based on the minimized structures with the ff03 force field show excellent capability to recognize the near-native binding poses for the short and medium-size peptides, respectively, and they outperform the predictions given by two popular protein-peptide docking algorithms (pepATTRACT and HPEPDOCK). Therefore, MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA are powerful tools to predict the binding affinities and identify the correct binding poses for protein-peptide systems.",

Although SBVS has been a common and proven technology, it still shows some challenges and problems that are needed to be addressed, where the negative influence regardless of protein flexibility and the inaccurate prediction of binding affinity are the two major challenges.

        "abstract": "A genetic algorithm (GA) combined with a tabu search (TA) has been applied as a minimization method to rake the appropriate associated sites for some biomolecular systems. In our docking procedure, surface complementarity and energetic complementarity of a ligand with its receptor have been considered separately in a two-stage docking method. The first stage was to find a set of potential associated sites mainly based on surface complementarity using a genetic algorithm combined with a tabu search. This step corresponds with the process of finding the potential binding sites where pharmacophores will bind. In the second stage, several hundreds of GA minimization steps were performed for each associated site derived from the first stage mainly based on the energetic complementarity. After calculations for both of the two stages, we can offer several solutions of associated sites for every complex. In this paper, seven biomolecular systems, including five bound complexes and two unbound complexes, were chosen from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to test our method. The calculated results were very encouraging-the hybrid minimization algorithm successfully reaches the correct solutions near the best binded modes for these protein complexes. The docking results not only predict the bound complexes very well, but also get a relatively accurate complexed conformation for unbound systems. For the five bound complexes, the results show that surface complementarity is enough to find the precise binding modes, the top solution from the tabu list generally corresponds to the correct binding mode. For the two unbound complexes, due to the conformational changes upon binding, it seems more difficult to get their correct binding conformations. The predicted results show that the correct binding mode also corresponds to a relatively large surface complementarity score. In these two test cases, the correct solution can be found in the top several solutions from the tabu list. For unbound complexes, the interaction energy from energetic complementarity is very important, it can be used to filter these solutions from the surface complementarity. After the evaluation of the energetic complementarity, the conformations and orientations close to the crystallographically determined structures are resolved. In most cases, the smallest root mean square distance (r.m.s.d.) from the GA combined with TA solutions is in a relatively small region. Our program of automatic docking is really a universal one among the procedures used for the theoretical study of molecular recognition.",

Recently, GO has been shown to be the most efficient inhibitor for α-chymotrypsin (ChT) compared with all other artificial inhibitors. However, how GO interacts with bioactive proteins and its potential in enzyme engineering have been rarely explored. In this study, we investigate the interactions between ChT and graphene/GO by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. We find that ChT is adsorbed onto the surface of GO or graphene during 100 ns MD simulations. The α-helix of ChT plays as an important anchor to interact with GO. The cationic and hydrophobic residues of ChT form strong interactions with GO, which leads to the deformation of the active site of ChT and the inhibition of ChT. In comparison, the active site of ChT is only slightly affected after ChT adsorbed onto the graphene surface. In addition, the secondary structure of ChT is not affected after it is adsorbed onto GO or graphene surface. Our results illustrate the mechanism of the interaction between GO/graphene and enzyme and provide guidelines for designing efficient artificial inhibitors.",

In this study, we evaluated the impact of enhanced sampling methods and solute dielectric constants on the overall accuracy of the molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) and molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) approaches for the protein-protein binding free energy calculations. Here, two widely used enhanced sampling methods, including aMD and GaMD, and conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations with two AMBER force fields (ff03 and ff14SB) were used to sample the conformations for 21 protein-protein complexes. The MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA calculation results illustrate that the standard MM/GBSA based on the cMD simulations yields the best Pearson correlation (rp = -0.523) between the predicted binding affinities and the experimental data, which is much higher than that given by MM/PBSA (rp = -0.212). Two enhanced sampling methods (aMD and GaMD) are indeed more efficient for conformational sampling, but they did not improve the binding affinity predictions for protein-protein systems, suggesting that the aMD or GaMD sampling (at least in short timescale simulations) may not be a good choice for the MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA predictions of protein-protein complexes. The solute dielectric constant of 1.0 is recommended to MM/GBSA, but a higher solute dielectric constant is recommended to MM/PBSA, especially for the systems with higher polarity on the protein-protein binding interfaces. Then, a preliminary assessment of the MM/GBSA calculations based on a variable dielectric generalized Born (VDGB) model was conducted.

        "abstract": "Tyrosine kinases are regarded as excellent targets for chemical drug therapy of carcinomas. However, under strong purifying selection, drug resistance usually occurs in the cancer cells within a short term. Many cases of drug resistance have been found to be associated with secondary mutations in drug target, which lead to the attenuated drug-target interactions. For example, recently, an acquired secondary mutation, G2032R, has been detected in the drug target, ROS1 tyrosine kinase, from a crizotinib-resistant patient, who responded poorly to crizotinib within a very short therapeutic term. It was supposed that the mutation was located at the solvent front and might hinder the drug binding. However, a different fact could be uncovered by the simulations reported in this study. Here, free energy surfaces were characterized by the drug-target distance and the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) conformational change of the crizotinib-ROS1 complex through advanced molecular dynamics techniques, and it was revealed that the more rigid P-loop region in the G2032R-mutated ROS1 was primarily responsible for the crizotinib resistance, which on one hand, impaired the binding of crizotinib directly, and on the other hand, shortened the residence time induced by the flattened free energy surface. Therefore, both of the binding affinity and the drug residence time should be emphasized in rational drug design to overcome the kinase resistance.",

The GA optimizations resulted in a group of linear models with three or four molecular descriptors with good statis- tical significance. The change of descriptor use as the evolution proceeds demonstrates that the octane/water partition coefficient and the partial negative solvent- accessible surface area multiplied by the negative charge are crucial to brain-blood barrier permeability. More- over, we found that the predictions using multiple QSPR models from GA optimization gave quite good results in spite of the diversity of structures, which was better than the predictions using the best single model. The predic- tions for the two external sets with 37 diverse com- pounds using multiple QSPR models indicate that the best linear models with four descriptors are sufficiently effective for predictive use.

Although high response ratio was detected from the patients treated with crizotinib, the cancer has eventually conferred resistance to crizotinib. Several drug resistance mutations have been found in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase domain as the target for crizotinib, but the drug resistance mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, the adaptive biasing force (ABF) method and two-end-state free energy calculation approaches were employed to elucidate the resistance mechanisms of crizotinib induced by the mutations L1152R, G1202R, and S1206Y. The ABF simulation results suggest that the reaction coordinates for the unbinding processes of crizotinib from the binding pockets of the mutated ALKs is different from that of the wild type ALK. The potentials of mean force for the crizotinib unbinding and the binding free energies predicted by the two-end-state free energy calculations are consistent with the experimental data. Our results indicate that the three mutations weaken the binding affinity of crizotinib obviously and lead to drug resistance. The free energy decomposition analysis illustrates the importance of the loss of two important H-bonds in the L1152R and S1206Y mutants on drug resistance. The entropy analysis shows that the entropy term plays a critical role in the substantial change of the conformational entropies of G1202R and L1152R.

Therefore, precise prediction of resistant viral mutants is particularly useful for developing effective drugs and designing therapeutic regimen. In this study, we applied a structure-based computational approach to predict mutants of the HIV-1 protease resistant to the seven FDA approved drugs. We analyzed the energetic pattern of the protease-drug interaction by calculating the molecular interaction energy components (MIECs) between the drug and the protease residues. Support vector machines (SVMs) were trained on MIECs to classify protease mutants into resistant and nonresistant categories. The high prediction accuracies for the test sets of cross-validations suggested that the MIECs successfully characterized the interaction interface between drugs and the HIV-1 protease. We conducted a proof-of-concept study on a newly approved drug, darunavir (TMC114), on which no drug resistance data were available in the public domain. Compared with amprenavir, our analysis suggested that darunavir might be more potent to combat drug resistance. To quantitatively estimate binding affinities of drugs and study the contributions of protease residues to causing resistance, linear regression models were trained on MIECs using partial least squares (PLS). The MIEC-PLS models also achieved satisfactory prediction accuracy. Analysis of the fitting coefficients of MIECs in the regression model revealed the important resistance mutations and shed light into understanding the mechanisms of these mutations to cause resistance. Our study demonstrated the advantages of characterizing the protease-drug interaction using MIECs.

The stability of a borophene nanoribbon increases with its width and only the lined-edged borophene nanoribbons are stable in the free-standing form. Such anisotropic stability dependence is ascribed to the large scale delocalization of π electrons along the boron rows. In particular, all line-edge borophene nanoribbons undergo edge reconstructions, in which the out-of-plane bulking edge atoms are reconstructed to form quasi planar edge structures. Such edge reconstructions have not yet been reported, which is critical for the formation of boron nanostructrues. Subsequent electronic transport calculations based on a non-equilibrium Green’s function indicated that line-edge borophene nanoribbons exhibit low-resistivity Ohmic conductance. Our results indicated that the line-edge borophene nanoribbons present remarkable properties (high thermal stabilities, Ohmic conductance with low electrical resistivity and good rigidities) and are promising for applications as one-dimensional electrical connections in compact nanoscale circuits.",

        "abstract": "Molecular polarizability of a molecule characterizes the capability of its electronic system to be distorted by the external field, and it plays an important role in modeling many molecular properties and biological activities. In this paper, a set of fast empirical models have been developed to predict molecular polarizability using two types of approaches. The first type of approaches is based on Slater's rules of calculating the effective atomic nuclear shielding constants. The best model (model 1A) of this category has achieved an average unsigned error (AUE), root-mean square error (RMSE), and average percent error (APE) of 2.23 au, 3.29 au, and 2.77%, respectively. The second type of model is based on an additive hypothesis of molecular polarizability. Five models have been constructed using different schemes of atom types. The best model that applies 14 atom types, model 2e, achieves AUE, RMSE, and APE of 0.99 au, 1.48 au, and 1.24%, respectively. This performance is much better than those of the models purely based upon chemical composition (model 2A and the Bosque and Sales model), for which errors are about 2-fold higher. It is expected that both model 1A and model 2E will have broad applications in QSAR and QSPR studies.",

In this paper, first-principle calculations and grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations are performed and used to show that the MoS2 layer is efficient at absorbing non-polar gases. Compared with the popular gas sorbents (metal organic frameworks and carbon-based materials), MoS2 has additional advantages, including large surface to volume ratio and tunable properties. The non-polar gas [carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)] adsorption on the MoS2 layer with and without vacancies has been systematically studied. The perfect MoS2 shows little or no adsorption for CO2 and CH4 molecules, but the MoS2 with a single S vacancy and double S vacancies exhibits an excellent adsorption ability for CO2 and CH4 gases. The adsorption energies were 65 kJ mol(-1) for CO2 and 47 kJ mol(-1) for CH4 (van der Waals-D2), respectively. An orbital coupling between the p orbital of the CO2 (or CH4) molecule and the d orbital of the Mo atom was observed. GCMC simulation results show that MoS2 with a single S vacancy could absorb 42.1 wt% of CO2 and 37.6 wt% of CH4 under a pressure of 80 bar at room temperature. The results given in this paper indicate that monolayer MoS2 with defects is a highly efficient absorbent for non-polar gases.",

Chemical-induced urinary tract toxicity is one of the main reasons that cause failure during drug development, and it is a common adverse event for medications, natural supplements, and environmental chemicals. Despite its importance, there are only a few in silico models for assessing urinary tract toxicity for a large number of compounds with diverse chemical structures. Here, we developed a series of qualitative and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting urinary tract toxicity. In our study, the recursive feature elimination method incorporated with random forests (RFE-RF) was used for dimension reduction, and then eight machine learning approaches were used for QSAR modeling, i.e., relevance vector machine (RVM), support vector machine (SVM), regularized random forest (RRF), C5.0 trees, eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), AdaBoost.M1, SVM boosting (SVMBoost), and RVM boosting (RVMBoost). For building classification models, the synthetic minority oversampling technique was used to handle the imbalance data set problem. Among all the machine learning approaches, SVMBoost based on the RBF kernel achieves both the best quantitative (qext2 = 0.845) and qualitative predictions for the test set (MCC of 0.787, AUC of 0.893, sensitivity of 89.6%, specificity of 94.1%, and global accuracy of 90.8%). The application domains were then analyzed, and all of the tested chemicals fall within the application domain coverage. We also examined the structure features of the chemicals with large prediction errors. In brief, both the regression and classification models developed by the SVMBoost approach have reliable prediction capability for assessing chemical-induced urinary tract toxicity.",

Here, by using enhanced sampling simulations (umbrella sampling, US) and two-end-state free energy calculations (MM/GSBA), we systemically studied the dissociation processes of two distinct small molecules escaping from the binding pocket of p38 MAP kinase through the allosteric channel and the ATP channel. The results show that the unbinding pathways along the allosteric channel have much lower PMF depths than those along the ATP channel, suggesting that the allosteric channel is more favorable for the dissociations of the two inhibitors and thereby supporting the general understanding that the largest channel of a target is usually the entry/exit pathway for the binding/dissociation of small molecules. Interestingly, the MM/GBSA approach yielded similar PMF profiles compared with those based on US, a much time consuming approach, indicating that for a general study, such as detecting the important transition state of a ligand binding/unbinding process, MM/GBSA may be a feasible choice.",

In order to gain a deeper insight into the microscopic binding of this inhibitor with ROCK1 and design derivatives with improved potency, the interactions between ROCK1 and a series of triazine/pyrimidine-based inhibitors were studied by using an integrated computational protocol that combines molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding free energy calculations, and binding energy decomposition analysis. First, three docking protocols, rigid receptor docking, induced fit docking, QM-polarized ligand docking, were used to determine the binding modes of the studied inhibitors in the active site of ROCK1. The results illustrate that rigid receptor docking achieves the best performance to rank the binding affinities of the studied inhibitors. Then, based on the predicted structures from molecular docking, MD simulations and MM/GBSA free energy calculations were employed to determine the dynamic binding process and compare the binding modes of the inhibitors with different activities. The binding free energies predicted by MM/GBSA are in good agreement with the experimental bioactivities, and the analysis of the individual energy terms suggests that the van der Waals interaction is the major driving force for ligand binding. In addition, the residue-inhibitor interaction spectra were obtained by the MM/GBSA free energy decomposition analysis, and the important residues for achieving strong binding were highlighted, which affords important guidance for the rational design of novel ROCK inhibitors. Finally, a variety of derivatives of inhibitor 1 were designed and four of them showed promising potency according to the predictions. We expect that our study can provide significant insight into the development of improved inhibitors of ROCK1.",

Three-dimensional quantitative structure-affinity relationship (3D-QSAR) analyses on the 200 peptides with known binding affinities to the amphiphysin-1 SH3 domain was then performed using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA). The best CoMSIA model showed promising predictive power, giving good predictions for about 95% of the peptides in the test set (absolute prediction errors less than 1.0). It was used to validate peptide-SH3 binding structure and provide insight into the structural requirements for binding of peptides to SH3 domains. Finally, MD simulations were performed to analyze the interaction between the SH3 domain and another peptide GFPRRPPPRG that contains with the PXRPXsR (s represents residues with small side chains) motif. MD simulations demonstrated that the binding conformation of GFPRRPPPRG is quite different from that of PLPRRPPRAA especially the four residues at the C terminal, which may explain why the CoMSIA model cannot give good predictions on the peptides of the PXRPXsR motif. Because of its efficiency and predictive power, the 3D-QSAR model can be used as a scoring filter for predicting peptide sequences bound to SH3 domains.",

In the present study, we demonstrated that amitriptyline inhibited cyclin D2 transactivation and displayed potential antimyeloma activity by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs). Amitriptyline markedly decreased cyclin D2 promoter-driven luciferase activity, reduced cyclin D2 expression, and arrested cells at the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle. Amitriptyline-induced apoptosis was confirmed by Annexin V staining, and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1. D-Cyclin expression is reported to be epigenetically regulated by histone acetylation. Thus, we examined the effects of amitriptyline on histone 3 (H3) acetylation and demonstrated that amitriptyline increased acetylation of H3 and expression of p27 and p21. Further studies indicated that amitriptyline interfered with HDAC function by down-regulation of HDAC3, -6, -7, and -8, but not HDAC2, and by interacting with HDAC7. Molecular docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that amitriptyline bound to HDAC7 and formed strong van der Waals interactions with five residues of HDAC7, including Phe162, His192, Phe221, Leu293, and His326, thus inhibiting HDAC activity.

        "abstract": "Cancer expression of PD-L1 suppresses anti-tumor immunity. PD-L1 has emerged as a remarkable therapeutic target. However, the regulation of PD-L1 degradation is not understood. Here, we identify several compounds as inducers of PD-L1 degradation using a high-throughput drug screen. We find EGFR inhibitors promote PD-L1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation following GSK3α-mediated phosphorylation of Ser279/Ser283. We identify ARIH1 as the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for targeting PD-L1 to degradation. Overexpression of ARIH1 suppresses tumor growth and promotes cytotoxic T cell activation in wild-type, but not in immunocompromised mice, highlighting the role of ARIH1 in anti-tumor immunity. Moreover, combining EGFR inhibitor ES-072 with anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy results in an additive effect on both tumor growth and cytotoxic T cell activation. Our results delineate a mechanism of PD-L1 degradation and cancer escape from immunity via EGFR-GSK3α-ARIH1 signaling and suggest GSK3α and ARIH1 might be potential drug targets to boost anti-tumor immunity and enhance immunotherapies.",

        "abstract": "The morphology of active layers in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is critical to the performance of organic photovoltaics (OPV). Currently, there is limited information for the morphology from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. Meanwhile, there are limited approaches to predict the morphology /efficiency of OPV. Here we use Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) to determine 3D morphology of BHJ solar cells and show DPD to be an efficient approach to predict the 3D morphology. Based on the 3D morphology, we estimate the performance indicator of BHJ solar cells by using graph theory. Specifically, we study poly (3-hexylthiophene)/[6, 6]-phenyl-C61butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT/PCBM) BHJ solar cells. We find that, when the volume fraction of PCBM is in the region 0.4 ∼ 0.5, P3HT/PCBM will show bi-continuous morphology and optimum performance, consistent with experimental results. Further, the optimum temperature (413 K) for the morphology and performance of P3HT/PCBM is in accord with annealing results. We find that solvent additive plays a critical role in the desolvation process of P3HT/PCBM BHJ solar cell. Our approach provides a direct method to predict dynamic 3D morphology and performance indicator for BHJ solar cells.",

        "abstract": "The outbreak and high speed global spread of the new strain of influenza A/H1N1 virus in 2009 posed a serious threat to global health. It is more likely that drug-resistant influenza strains will arise after the extensive use of anti-influenza drugs. Consequently, the identification of the potential resistant sites for drugs in advance and the understanding of the corresponding molecular mechanisms that cause drug resistance are quite important in the design of new drug candidates with better potency to combat drug resistance. Here, we performed molecular simulations to evaluate the potency of oseltamivir to combat drug resistance caused by the mutations in 2009 A/H1N1 neuraminidase (NA). We examined three representative drug-resistant mutations in NA, consisting of H274Y, N294S, and Y252H. First, a theoretical structure of A/H1N1 NA in complex with oseltamivir was constructed using homology modeling. Then, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculations, and MM/GBSA free energy decomposition were used to characterize the binding of oseltamivir with the wild type (WT) and three mutated NAs. Our predictions show that N294S and H274Y, two popular drug-resistant mutations in different variants of NA, still cause significant resistance to oseltamivir. However, the Y252H mutation does not impair the interactions between oseltamivir and A/H1N1 NA. An examination of individual energy components shows that the loss of polar interactions is the key source for the resistance of the studied mutations to oseltamivir. Moreover, free energy decomposition analysis and structural analysis reveal that the N294S or H274Y mutation triggers the large-scale conformational changes of the binding pocket and then impairs the affinity of oseltamivir. We expect that our results will be useful for the rational design of NA inhibitors with high potency against drug-resistant A/H1N1 mutants.",

        "abstract": "As a dangerous end point, respiratory toxicity can cause serious adverse health effects and even death. Meanwhile, it is a common and traditional issue in occupational and environmental protection. Pharmaceutical and chemical industries have a strong urge to develop precise and convenient computational tools to evaluate the respiratory toxicity of compounds as early as possible. Most of the reported theoretical models were developed based on the respiratory toxicity data sets with one single symptom, such as respiratory sensitization, and therefore these models may not afford reliable predictions for toxic compounds with other respiratory symptoms, such as pneumonia or rhinitis. Here, based on a diverse data set of mouse intraperitoneal respiratory toxicity characterized by multiple symptoms, a number of quantitative and qualitative predictions models with high reliability were developed by machine learning approaches. First, a four-tier dimension reduction strategy was employed to find an optimal set of 20 molecular descriptors for model building. Then, six machine learning approaches were used to develop the prediction models, including relevance vector machine (RVM), support vector machine (SVM), regularized random forest (RRF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), naïve Bayes (NB), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Among all of the models, the SVM regression model shows the most accurate quantitative predictions for the test set (q2ext = 0.707), and the XGBoost classification model achieves the most accurate qualitative predictions for the test set (MCC of 0.644, AUC of 0.893, and global accuracy of 82.62%). The application domains were analyzed, and all of the tested compounds fall within the application domain coverage. We also examined the structural features of the compounds and important fragments with large prediction errors. In conclusion, the SVM regression model and the XGBoost classification model can be employed as accurate prediction tools for respiratory toxicity.",

However, designing potent PROTACs with desirable drug-like properties still remains a great challenge. Here, we report an updated online database, PROTAC-DB 2.0, which is a repository of structural and experimental data about PROTACs. In this 2nd release, we expanded the number of PROTACs to 3270, which corresponds to a 96% expansion over the first version. Meanwhile, the numbers of warheads (small molecules targeting the proteins of interest), linkers, and E3 ligands (small molecules recruiting E3 ligases) have increased to over 360, 1500 and 80, respectively. In addition, given the importance and the limited number of the crystal target-PROTAC-E3 ternary complex structures, we provide the predicted ternary complex structures for PROTACs with good degradation capability using our PROTAC-Model method.

Thereafter, by combining different model construction protocols, the issues related to developing best MIEC-SVM models were firstly discussed upon three kinase targets (ABL, ALK, and BRAF).

In many cases, it has been shown that the binding affinities predicted by classical scoring functions (SFs) cannot correlate well with experimentally measured biological activities. In the past few years, machine learning (ML)-based SFs have gradually emerged as potential alternatives and outperformed classical SFs in a series of studies. In this study, to better recognize the potential of classical SFs, we have conducted a comparative assessment of 25 commonly used SFs. Accordingly, the scoring power was systematically estimated by using the state-of-the-art ML methods that replaced the original multiple linear regression method to refit individual energy terms. The results show that the newly-developed ML-based SFs consistently performed better than classical ones. In particular, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and random forest (RF) achieved the best predictions in most cases. The newly-developed ML-based SFs were also tested on another benchmark modified from PDBbind v2007, and the impacts of structural and sequence similarities were evaluated. The results indicated that the superiority of the ML-based SFs could be fully guaranteed when sufficient similar targets were contained in the training set. Moreover, the effect of the combinations of features from multiple SFs was explored, and the results indicated that combining NNscore2.0 with one to four other classical SFs could yield the best scoring power. However, it was not applicable to derive a generic target-specific SF or SF combination.",

        "abstract": "sition metals, such as Rh, Ir, Pd and Pt, have a strong tendency to form a square-planar 16-electron complex. Although this feature has been widely used in organometallics to develop homogeneous catalysts, a single-atom heterogeneous analogue has not yet been reported. In this work, we show that a 16-electron complex may act as an important transition state in the CO oxidation over a single Pt atom supported by a MoS2 monolayer (Pt/MoS2). The catalytic oxidation reaction prefers to start with the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) reaction, where the CO and O2 molecules are first co-adsorbed on the Pt atom, then cross a small barrier of 0.40 eV to form a square-planar 16-electron intermediate state, and subsequently the first CO2 is released. The activation barrier of the following Eley–Rideal (E–R) reaction is only 0.23 eV. The superior catalytic reactivity of the Pt/MoS2 surface can be explained by the quantum confinement effect of the Pt-5d orbitals and the stability of the square-planar 16-electron transition state. In addition, MoS2 may serve as a defect-free two dimensional anchoring substrate for Pt atomic adsorption. It provides not only a very large surface-to-volume ratio, but also a well-defined structure with a uniform distribution of anchoring points. The square-planar 16-electron intermediate state of the L–H reaction, together with the new MoS2 anchoring substrate, may provide a new opportunity for the design of single-atom catalysts on two-dimensional surfaces.",

The prediction of BCRP inhibition can facilitate evaluating potential drug resistance and drug-drug interactions in early stage of drug discovery. Here we reported a structurally diverse dataset consisting of 1098 BCRP inhibitors and 1701 non-inhibitors. Analysis of various physicochemical properties illustrates that BCRP inhibitors are more hydrophobic and aromatic than non-inhibitors. We then developed a series of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to discriminate between BCRP inhibitors and non-inhibitors. The optimal feature subset was determined by a wrapper feature selection method named rfSA (simulated annealing algorithm coupled with random forest), and the classification models were established by using seven machine learning approaches based on the optimal feature subset, including a deep learning method, two ensemble learning methods, and four classical machine learning methods. The statistical results demonstrated that three methods, including support vector machine (SVM), deep neural networks (DNN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), outperformed the others, and the SVM classifier yielded the best predictions (MCC = 0.812 and AUC = 0.958 for the test set). Then, a perturbation-based model-agnostic method was used to interpret our models and analyze the representative features for different models. The application domain analysis demonstrated the prediction reliability of our models. Moreover, the important structural fragments related to BCRP inhibition were identified by the information gain (IG) method along with the frequency analysis. In conclusion, we believe that the classification models developed in this study can be regarded as simple and accurate tools to distinguish BCRP inhibitors from non-inhibitors in drug design and discovery pipelines.",

Human neutrophil peptides 1-3 (HNP1-3) are the most abundant neutrophil granule proteins but their neutrophil content varies because of unusually extensive gene copy number polymorphism. A genetic association study found that increased copy number of the HNP-encoding gene DEFA1/DEFA3 is a risk factor for organ dysfunction during sepsis development. However, direct experimental evidence demonstrating that these risk alleles are pathogenic for sepsis is lacking because the genes are present only in some primates and humans. Here, we generate DEFA1/DEFA3 transgenic mice with neutrophil-specific expression of the peptides. We show that mice with high copy number of DEFA1/DEFA3 genes have more severe sepsis-related vital organ damage and mortality than mice with low copy number of DEFA1/DEFA3 or wild-type mice, resulting from more severe endothelial barrier dysfunction and endothelial cell pyroptosis after sepsis challenge. Mechanistically, HNP-1 induces endothelial cell pyroptosis via P2X7 receptor-mediating canonical caspase-1 activation in a NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent manner. Based on these findings, we engineered a monoclonal antibody against HNP-1 to block the interaction with P2X7 and found that the blocking antibody protected mice carrying high copy number of DEFA1/DEFA3 from lethal sepsis. We thus demonstrate that DEFA1/DEFA3 copy number variation strongly modulates sepsis development in vivo and explore a paradigm for the precision treatment of sepsis tailored by individual genetic information.",

On average, particularly from the perspective of unique fragments and scaffolds, MNPs usually possess more long chains and large rings, especially 8- to 10-membered rings. MNPs also have more nitrogen atoms and halogens, notably bromines, and fewer oxygen atoms, suggesting that MNPs may be synthesized by more diverse biosynthetic pathways than TNPs. Analysis of the frequently occurring Murcko frameworks in MNPs and TNPS also reveals a striking difference between MNPs and TNPs. The scaffolds of the former tend to be longer and often contain ester bonds connected to 10-membered rings, while the scaffolds of the latter tend to be shorter and often bear more stable ring systems and bond types. Besides, the prediction from the naïve Bayesian drug-likeness classification model suggests that most compounds in MNPs and TNPs are drug-like, although MNPs are slightly more drug-like than TNPs. We believe that MNPs and TNPs with novel drug-like scaffolds have great potential to be drug leads or drug candidates in drug discovery campaigns.",

        "title": "The inflammatory cytokine IL-6 induces FRA1 deacetylation promoting colorectal cancer stem-like properties",
        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) has long been known for its tight association with chronic inflammation, thought to play a key role in tumor onset and malignant progression through the modulation of cancer stemness. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are still largely elusive. Here we show that the IL-6/STAT3 inflammatory signaling axis induces the deacetylation of FRA1 at the Lys-116 residue located within its DNA-binding domain. The HDAC6 deacetylase underlies this key modification leading to the increase of FRA1 transcriptional activity, the subsequent transactivation of NANOG expression, and the acquisition of stem-like cellular features. As validated in a large (n = 123) CRC cohort, IL-6 secretion was invariably accompanied by increased FRA1 deacetylation at K116 and an overall increase in its protein levels, coincident with malignant progression and poor prognosis. Of note, combined treatment with the conventional cytotoxic drug 5-FU together with Tubastatin A, a HDAC6-specific inhibitor, resulted in a significant in vivo synergistic inhibitory effect on tumor growth through suppression of CRC stemness. Our results reveal a novel transcriptional and posttranslational regulatory cross-talk between inflammation and stemness signaling pathways that underlie self-renewal and maintenance of CRC stem cells and promote their malignant behavior. Combinatorial treatment aimed at the core regulatory mechanisms downstream of IL-6 may offer a novel promising approach for CRC treatment.",

        "abstract": "Deciphering the structural determinants of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is essential to gain a deep understanding of many important biological functions in the living cells. Computational approaches for the structural modeling of PPIs, such as protein-protein docking, are quite needed to complement existing experimental techniques. The reliability of a protein-protein docking method is dependent on the ability of the scoring function to accurately distinguish the near-native binding structures from a huge number of decoys. In this study, we developed HawkRank, a novel scoring function designed for the sampling stage of protein-protein docking by summing the contributions from several energy terms, including van der Waals potentials, electrostatic potentials and desolvation potentials. First, based on the solvation free energies predicted by the Generalized Born model for ~ 800 proteins, a SASA (solvent accessible surface area)-based solvation model was developed, which can give the aqueous solvation free energies for proteins by summing the contributions of 21 atom types. Then, the van der Waals potentials and electrostatic potentials based on the Amber ff14SB force field were computed. Finally, the HawkRank scoring function was derived by determining the most optimal weights for five energy terms based on the training set. Here, MSR (modified success rate), a novel protein-protein scoring quality index, was used to assess the performance of HawkRank and three other popular protein-protein scoring functions, including ZRANK, FireDock and dDFIRE. The results show that HawkRank outperformed the other three scoring functions according to the total number of hits and MSR. HawkRank is available at http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/programs/hawkrank .",

Although lots of ABCG2 inhibitors were identified, none of them has been tested clinically, maybe because of several problems such as toxicity or safety and pharmacokinetic uncertainty of compounds with novel chemical structures. One efficient solution is to rediscover new uses for existing drugs with known pharmacokinetics and safety profiles. Here, we found the new use for sorafenib, which has a dual-mode action by inducing ABCG2 degradation in lysosome in addition to inhibiting its function. Previously, we reported some novel dual-acting ABCG2 inhibitors that showed closer similarity to degradation-induced mechanism of action. On the basis of these ABCG2 inhibitors with diverse chemical structures, we developed a pharmacophore model for identifying the critical pharmacophore features necessary for dual-acting ABCG2 inhibitors. Sorafenib forms impressive alignment with the pharmacophore hypothesis, supporting the argument that sorafenib is a potential ABCG2 inhibitor. This is the first article that sorafenib may be a good candidate for chemosensitizing agent targeting ABCG2-mediated MDR. This study may facilitate the rediscovery of new functions of structurally diverse old drugs and provide a more effective and safe way of sensitizing MDR in cancer chemotherapy.",

Significant progress in computational simulation is making it possible to understand the mechanism of drug delivery.

In this study, fastDRH, a free and open accessed web server, was developed to predict and analyze protein-ligand complex structures. In fastDRH server, AutoDock Vina and AutoDock-GPU docking engines, structure-truncated MM/PB(GB)SA free energy calculation procedures and multiple poses based per-residue energy decomposition analysis were well integrated into a user-friendly and multifunctional online platform. Benefit from the modular architecture, users can flexibly use one or more of three features, including molecular docking, docking pose rescoring and hotspot residue prediction, to obtain the key information clearly based on a result analysis panel supported by 3Dmol.js and Apache ECharts. In terms of protein-ligand binding mode prediction, the integrated structure-truncated MM/PB(GB)SA rescoring procedures exhibit a success rate of >80% in benchmark, which is much better than the AutoDock Vina (~70%). For hotspot residue identification, our multiple poses based per-residue energy decomposition analysis strategy is a more reliable solution than the one using only a single pose, and the performance of our solution has been experimentally validated in several drug discovery projects. To summarize, the fastDRH server is a useful tool for predicting the ligand binding mode and the hotspot residue of protein for ligand binding.

Current computational approaches aiming to filter out aggregated molecules based on their similarity to known aggregators, such as Aggregator Advisor, have low prediction accuracy, and therefore development of reliable in silico models to detect aggregators is highly desirable. In this study, we built a data set consisting of 12 119 aggregators and 24 172 drugs or drug candidates and then developed a group of classification models based on the combination of two ensemble learning approaches and five types of molecular representations. The best model yielded an accuracy of 0.950 and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.987 for the training set, and an accuracy of 0.937 and an AUC of 0.976 for the test set. The best model also gave reliable predictions to the external validation set with 5681 aggregators since 80% of molecules were predicted to be aggregators with a prediction probability higher than 0.9. More importantly, we explored the relationship between colloidal aggregation and molecular features, and generalized a set of simple rules to detect aggregators. Molecular features, such as log D, the number of hydroxyl groups, the number of aromatic carbons attached to a hydrogen atom, and the number of sulfur atoms in aromatic heterocycles, would be helpful to distinguish aggregators from nonaggregators. A comparison with numerous existing druglikeness and aggregation filtering rules and models used in virtual screening verified the high reliability of the model and rules proposed in this study. We also used the model to screen several curated chemical databases, and almost 20% of molecules in the evaluated databases were predicted as aggregators, highlighting the potential high risk of aggregation in screening.

        "abstract": "The G protein-coupled chemokine receptor CXCR4 is implicated in a variety of physiological responses that also share several downstream effectors involved in multiple pathological processes. The interaction between CXCR4 and its natural ligand CXCL12/stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) plays important roles in cancer metastasis, HIV-1 infection, and inflammatory diseases. Therefore, investigating the CXCR4-CXCL12 interaction is critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the modulation of chemokine-receptor functions and designing new pharmaceutical agents to target the CXCR4-CXCL12 pathway. Based on known experimental data, the interaction between CXCR4 and CXCL12 was predicted by an integrated protocol, which combines protein-protein docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy calculations, and MM/GBSA binding free energy decomposition analysis. The predicted CXCR4-CXCL12 binding pattern is in good agreement with the experimental data. Analysis of the binding structure reveals an obvious electrostatic complementarity between CXCR4 and CXCL12. Moreover, significant conformational rearrangements were observed during the 50 ns MD simulations. In particular, the basic Lys1 at the CXCL12 N-terminus, an essential residue in receptor activation, forms a strong polar interaction with the Glu32 in the CXCR4 extracellular region. It facilitates the significant movement of TM5 and TM6 in the conformational transition, which is coupled to the association with the intracellular signal transduction pathways via heterotrimer G-protein. Based on the dynamic and energetic analyses, a two-site binding model was proposed. We believe that our study provides useful information for understanding the mechanisms of CXCR4 ligand binding and structure-based drug design of CXCR4.",

        "abstract": "A novel method for the calculations of 1-octanol/water partition coefficient (log P) of organic molecules has been presented here. The method, SLOGP v1.0, estimates the log P values by summing the contribution of atom-weighted solvent accessible surface areas (SASA) and correction factors. Altogether 100 atom/group types were used to classify atoms with different chemical environments, and two correlation factors were used to consider the intermolecular hydrophobic interactions and intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Coefficient values for 100 atom/group and two correction factors have been derived from a training set of 1850 compounds. The parametrization procedure for different kinds of atoms was performed as follows: first, the atoms in a molecule were defined to different atom/group types based on SMARTS language, and the correction factors were determined by substructure searching; then, SASA for each atom/group type was calculated and added; finally, multivariate linear regression analysis was applied to optimize the hydrophobic parameters for different atom/group types and correction factors in order to reproduce the experimental log P. The correlation based on the training set gives a model with the correlation coefficient (r) of 0.988, the standard deviation (SD) of 0.368 log units, and the absolute unsigned mean error of 0.261. Comparison of various procedures of log P calculations for the external test set of 138 organic compounds demonstrates that our method bears very good accuracy and is comparable or even better than the fragment-based approaches. Moreover, the atom-additive approach based on SASA was compared with the simple atom-additive approach based on the number of atoms. The calculated results show that the atom-additive approach based on SASA gives better predictions than the simple atom-additive one. Due to the connection between the molecular conformation and the molecular surface areas, the atom-additive model based on SASA may be a more universal model for log P estimation especially for large molecules.",

The pharmacophore conditioning and docking-based Bayesian sampling were applied to efficiently navigate the vast chemical space for the design of molecules with desired geometric properties and pharmacophore features.

An exception was observed for RFscore-VS trained on the Directory of Useful Decoys-Enhanced dataset, which showed its superiority for most targets. However, in most cases, it clearly illustrated rather limited performance on the targets that were dissimilar to the proteins in the corresponding training sets. We also used the top three docking poses rather than the top one for rescoring and retrained the models with the updated versions of the training set, but only minor improvements were observed. Taken together, generic MLSFs may have poor generalization capabilities to be applicable for the real VS campaigns. Therefore, it should be quite cautious to use this type of methods for VS.",

In this work, we theoretically investigate the practical feasibility and catalytic activity of two-dimensional (2D) group IVA monochalcogenides MXs (M = Ge/Sn and X = S/Se) as potential and efficient ORR catalysts. Through first-principles calculations, it is found that these 2D MXs are semiconductors with high adsorption affinity and dissociation activity for oxygen molecules. Furthermore, the free energy diagrams along the four-electron pathway are simulated to elucidate the whole ORR mechanism catalyzed by the monolayer MXs (GeS, GeSe, and SnSe here), with all the energetically favorable intermediates being exothermic in free energy. In the acidic environment, the GeS monolayer exhibits the best performance due to its considerably low overpotential (0.52 V). While in the alkaline environment, there is no overpotential for the ORR catalyzed by the 2D MXs (GeS, GeSe, and SnSe). Our work provides a novel insight into the electrochemical applications of IVA monochalcogenides, which is expected to realize experimentally.",

        "abstract": "Androgen receptor (AR) plays important roles in the development of prostate cancer (PCa). The antagonistic drugs, which suppress the activity of AR, are widely used in the treatment of PCa. However, the molecular mechanism of antagonism about how ligands affect the structures of AR remains elusive. To better understand the conformational variability of ARs bound with agonists or antagonists, we performed long time unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and enhanced sampling simulations for the ligand binding domain of AR (AR-LBD) in complex with various ligands. Based on the simulation results, we proposed an allosteric pathway linking ligands and helix 12 (H12) of AR-LBD, which involves the interactions among the ligands and the residues W741, H874, and I899. The interaction pathway provides an atomistic explanation of how ligands affect the structure of AR-LBD. A repositioning of H12 was observed, but it is facilitated by the C-terminal of H12, instead of by the loop between helix 11 (H11) and H12. The bias-exchange metadynamics simulations further demonstrated the above observations. More importantly, the free energy profiles constructed by the enhanced sampling simulations revealed the transition process between the antagonistic form and agonistic form of AR-LBD. Our results would be helpful for the design of more efficient antagonists of AR to combat PCa.",

        "abstract": "Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has gained increased attention as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of various cancers, especially non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recently, piperidine carboxamides were reported as Type I1/2 inhibitors of ALK, which occupy both the ATP binding site and the back ATP hydrophobic cavity in DFG-in conformation. Due to the dynamic behavior of ALK in the binding of Type I1/2 inhibitors, the accurate predictions of the binding structures and relative binding potencies of these inhibitors are quite challenging. In this study, different modeling techniques, including molecular docking, ensemble docking based on multiple receptor conformations, molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations, were utilized to explore the binding mechanisms of piperidine carboxamides. Our predictions show that the conventional docking protocols are not sufficient to predict the relative binding potencies of the studied inhibitors with high accuracy, but incorporating protein flexibility before or after docking is quite effective to improve the prediction accuracy. Notably, the binding free energies predicted by MM/GBSA or MM/PBSA based on the MD simulations for the docked poses give the highest correlation with the experimental data, highlighting the importance of the inclusion of receptor flexibility for the accurate predictions of the binding potencies for Type I1/2 inhibitors of ALK. Furthermore, the comprehensive analysis of several pairs of representative inhibitors demonstrates the importance of hydrophobic interactions in improving the binding affinities of the inhibitors with the hot-spot residues surrounding the binding pocket. This work is expected to provide valuable clues for further rational design of novel and potent Type I1/2 ALK inhibitors.",

Compared with the mainstream descriptor- and graph-based methods for molecular property predictions, SMILES-based methods can directly extract molecular features from SMILES without human expert knowledge, but they require more powerful algorithms for feature extraction and a larger amount of data for training, which makes SMILES-based methods less popular. Here, we show the great potential of pre-training in promoting the predictions of important pharmaceutical properties. By utilizing three pre-training tasks based on atom feature prediction, molecular feature prediction and contrastive learning, a new pre-training method K-BERT, which can extract chemical information from SMILES like chemists, was developed. The calculation results on 15 pharmaceutical datasets show that K-BERT outperforms well-established descriptor-based (XGBoost) and graph-based (Attentive FP and HRGCN+) models. In addition, we found that the contrastive learning pre-training task enables K-BERT to 'understand' SMILES not limited to canonical SMILES. Moreover, the general fingerprints K-BERT-FP generated by K-BERT exhibit comparative predictive power to MACCS on 15 pharmaceutical datasets and can also capture molecular size and chirality information that traditional binary fingerprints cannot capture. Our results illustrate the great potential of K-BERT in the practical applications of molecular property predictions in drug discovery.",

Two of the most successful analogs of CPT, topotecan and irinotecan, have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of colon cancer and ovarian cancer, as well as other cancers. However, the emergence of drug resistance mutations in topoisomerase I is a big challenge for the effective therapy of these drugs. Therefore, in this study, a series of computational approaches from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations and Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy calculations were employed to uncover the molecular principle of the topotecan resistance induced by three mutations in DNA topoisomerase I, including E418K, G503S, and D533G. Our results demonstrate a remarkable correlation between the binding free energies predicted by MM/GBSA and the rupture forces computed by SMD, and moreover, the theoretical results given by MM/GBSA and SMD are in excellent agreement with the experimental data for ranking the inhibitory activities: WT > E418K > G503S > D533G. In order to explore the drug resistance mechanism that underlies the loss of the binding affinity of topotecan, the binding modes of topotecan bound to the WT and mutated receptors were presented, and comparisons of the binding geometries and energy contributions on a per residue basis of topotecan between the WT complex and each mutant were also discussed. The results illustrate that the mutations of E418K, G503S, and D533G have great influence on the binding of topotecan to topoisomerase I bound with DNA, and the variations of the polar interactions play critical roles in the development of drug resistance. The information obtained from this study provides useful clues for designing improved topoisomerase I inhibitors for combating drug resistance.",

The common pharmacophore model based on these 31 compounds was used as a template to obtain the aligned molecular aggregate, which provided a good starting point for 3D-QSAR analysis of only the 19 benzylidene malononitriles. Two molecular field analysis (MFA) techniques, including CoMFA and CoMSIA, were used to derive the quantitative structure-activity relationships of the studied molecules. From the studied results, it was obvious that the 3D-QSAR models based on the pharmacophore alignment were superior to those based on the simple atom-by-atom fits. Considering the flexibility of the studied molecules and the difference between the active conformers and the energy-lowest conformers, the pharmacophore model can usually provide the common features for the flexible regions. Moreover, the best CoMSIA model based on the pharmacophore hypothesis gave good statistical measure from partial least-squares analysis (PLS) (q(2) = 0.71), which was slightly better than the CoMFA one. Our study demonstrated that pharmacophore modeling and CoMSIA research could be effectively combined.

The high adsorption energies (−1.09 to −0.75 eV) of NH3 on different adsorption sites of the B40 surface indicate that NH3 strongly chemisorbs to B40. The charge transfer induced by the NH3 adsorption results in a modification of the density of states (DOS) of B40 near the Fermi level, and therefore changes its electronic transport properties. For all possible adsorption sites, the adsorption of NH3 exclusively leads to a decrease of the conductance of B40. Taking into consideration that the non-polar gas molecules (e.g. N2, H2 and CH4) are only physisorbed and show negligible effect on the conductance properties of B40, we would expect that B40 can be used as a single-molecular gas sensor to distinguish NH3 from non-polar gas molecules at low bias.",

        "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in molecular property prediction, but explaining their black-box predictions is still a challenge. Most existing explanation methods for GNNs in chemistry focus on attributing model predictions to individual nodes, edges or fragments that are not necessarily derived from a chemically meaningful segmentation of molecules. To address this challenge, we propose a method named substructure mask explanation (SME). SME is based on well-established molecular segmentation methods and provides an interpretation that aligns with the understanding of chemists. We apply SME to elucidate how GNNs learn to predict aqueous solubility, genotoxicity, cardiotoxicity and blood-brain barrier permeation for small molecules. SME provides interpretation that is consistent with the understanding of chemists, alerts them to unreliable performance, and guides them in structural optimization for target properties. Hence, we believe that SME empowers chemists to confidently mine structure-activity relationship (SAR) from reliable GNNs through a transparent inspection on how GNNs pick up useful signals when learning from data.",

However, high structural conservation of the catalytic domains of DNMTs poses a big challenge to design selective inhibitors for a specific DNMT isoform. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, end-point free energy calculations and umbrella sampling (US) simulations were performed to reveal the molecular basis of the binding selectivity of three representative DNMT inhibitors towards DNMT1 and DNMT3A, including SFG (DNMT1 and DNMT3A dual inhibitors), DC-05 (DNMT1 selective inhibitor) and GSKex1 (DNMT3A selective inhibitor). The binding selectivity of the studied inhibitors reported in previous experiments is reproduced by the MD simulation and binding free energy prediction. The simulation results also suggest that the driving force to determine the binding selectivity of the studied inhibitors stems from the difference in the protein-inhibitor van der Waals interactions. Meanwhile, the per-residue free energy decomposition reveals that the contributions from several non-conserved residues in the binding pocket of DNMT1/DNMT3A, especially Val1580/Trp893, Asn1578/Arg891 and Met1169/Val665, are the key factors responsible for the binding selectivity of DNMT inhibitors. In addition, the binding preference of the studied inhibitors was further validated by the potentials of mean force predicted by the US simulations.

Currently available drugs are all type-I inhibitors bound to the ATP-binding pocket and are most likely to be resistant in patients harboring genetic mutations surrounding the ATP pocket. To overcome drug resistance, we rationally designed a novel kind of “bridge” inhibitor, which specially bind into an extended hydrophobic back pocket adjacent to the ATP-binding site of ALK. The novel type-I1/2 inhibitors display excellent antiproliferation activity against ALK-positive cancer cells and appear superior to two clinically used drugs, crizotinib and ceritinib. Structural and molecular modeling analyses indicate that the inhibitor induces dramatic conformational transition and stabilizes unique DFG-shifted loop conformation, enabling persistent sensitivity to different genetic mutations in ALK.

Here, EAT specifically refers to the output of the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) scoring, including the energy scores of five different classical SFs and the Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprint (PLIF) terms. The performance of EAT-Score to discriminate actives from decoys was strictly validated on the DUD-E diverse subset by using different performance metrics. The results showed that EAT-Score performed much better than classical SFs in VS, with its AUC values exhibiting an improvement of around 0.3. Meanwhile, EAT-Score could achieve comparable even better prediction performance compared with other state-of-the-art VS methods, such as some machine learning (ML)-based SFs and classical SFs implemented in docking programs, in terms of AUC, LogAUC, or BEDROC. Furthermore, the EAT-Score model can capture important binding pattern information from protein-ligand complexes by Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis, which may be very helpful in interpreting the ligand binding mechanism for a certain target and thereby guiding drug design.",

Deep analysis shows that stereospecificity is prevalent in the binding of crizotinib to MTH1, where the target is more preferred to bind with the (S)-enantiomer of crizotinib. Surprisingly, very similar binding modes were found for the two enantiomers (Huber et al.

Thereafter, by using advanced all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we characterized the free energy surfaces of the binding/unbinding processes of the (S) and (R)-crizotinib enantiomers to/from MTH1. Interestingly, we found that rather than the induced-fit process, which is prevalent in drug selectivity and specificity (Wilson et al.

First, the prediction capabilities of molecular docking and pharmacophore mapping to distinguish inhibitors from noninhibitors for the selected T2DM-related targets were evaluated. The results show that molecular docking or pharmacophore mapping can give satisfactory predictions for most targets but the validations are still quite necessary because the prediction accuracies of these two methods are variable across different targets. Then, the Bayesian classifiers by integrating the predictions from molecular docking and pharmacophore mapping were developed, and the well-validated Bayesian classifiers for 15 targets were utilized to find the potential inhibitors from TCM and establish the compound-target interaction network. The analysis of the compound-target network demonstrates that a small portion (18.6%) of the predicted inhibitors can interact with multitargets. The pharmacological activities for some potential inhibitors have been experimentally confirmed, highlighting the reliability of the Bayesian classifiers. Besides, it is interesting to find that a considerable number of the predicted multitarget inhibitors have free radical scavenging/antioxidant activities, which are closely related to T2DM. It appears that the pharmacological effect of the TCM formulas is determined not only by the compounds that interact directly with one or more T2DM-related targets, but also by the compounds with other supplementary bioactivities important for relieving T2DM, such as free radical scavenging/antioxidant effects. The mechanism uncovered by this study may offer a deep insight for understanding the theory of the classical TCM formulas for combating T2DM. Moreover, the predicted inhibitors for the T2DM-related targets may provide a good source to find new lead compounds against T2DM.",

The communications between the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) and its coactivator are critical to the activation of AR. It is still unclear how the ligand binding would affect the AR-coactivator interactions. In this work, the effects of the ligand binding on the AR-coactivator communications were explored by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results showed that the ligand binding regulates the residue interactions in the function site AF-2. The ligand-to-coactivator allosteric pathway, which involves the coactivator, helix 3 (H3), helix 4 (H4), the loop between H3 and H4 (L3), and helix 12 (H12), and ligands, was characterized. In addition, the interactions of residues on the function site BF-3, especially on the boundary of AF-2 and BF-3, are also affected by the ligands. The MM/GBSA free energy calculations demonstrated that the binding affinity between the coactivator and apo-AR is roughly weaker than those between the coactivator and antagonistic ARs but stronger than those between the coactivator and agonistic ARs. The results indicated that the long-range electrostatic interactions and the conformational entropies are the main factors affecting the binding free energies. In addition, the F876L mutation on AR-LBD affects the ligand-to-coactivator allosteric pathway, which could be the reason for point mutation induced tolerance for the antagonistic drugs such as enzalutamide.

For 2D-GeXs, Li4O4 with a ring-like structure is the final discharge product. The free energy diagram demonstrates that 2D-GeSe is more energetically favorable than 2D-GeS due to its considerably lower oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) overpotential (0.94 V) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential (1.30 V), which originate from its weaker binding with LiO2 and stronger binding with the inserted Li atom. The analyses on electronic properties elucidate that the final product of Li4O4 on 2D-GeSe induces the semiconductor to semi-metal transition.

Because paclitaxel is metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, the possibility of drug-drug interactions mediated by enzyme inhibition may exist between the combining agents. In the present study, a total of 12 kinase inhibitors were evaluated for inhibitory potency in human liver microsomes by monitoring the formation of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 metabolites simultaneously. For reversible inhibition, nilotinib was found to be the most potent inhibitor against both CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and the inhibition potency could be explained by strong hydrogen binding based on molecular docking simulations and type II binding based on spectral analysis. Comparison of K(i) values revealed that the CYP2C8 pathway was more sensitive toward some kinase inhibitors (such as axitinib), while the CYP3A4 pathway was preferentially inhibited by others (such as bosutinib). Pathway-dependent inactivation (time-dependent inhibition) was also observed for a number of kinase inhibitors against CYP3A4 but not CYP2C8. Further studies showed that axitinib had a K(I) of 0.93 μM and k(inact) of 0.0137 min(-1), and the observed inactivation toward CYP3A4 was probably due to the formation of reactive intermediate(s). Using a static model, a reasonably accurate prediction of drug-drug interactions was achieved by incorporating parallel pathways and hepatic extraction ratio. The present results suggest that potent and pathway-dependent inhibition of CYP2C8 and/or CYP3A4 pathways by kinase inhibitors may alter the ratio of paclitaxel metabolites in vivo, and that such changes can be clinically relevant as differential metabolism has been linked to paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity in cancer patients.",

The 4d electrons of Mo introduce localized states into the forbidden band of TiO(2), and this shifts the absorption edge into the visible-light region and enhances the photocatalytic activity. Since defects are universally distributed in TiO(2) or doped TiO(2), the effect of oxygen deficiency due to oxygen vacancies or interstitial Mo atoms is systemically studied. Oxygen vacancies associated with the Mo dopant atoms or interstitial Mo will reduce the spin polarization and magnetic moment of Mo-doped TiO(2).

Therefore, AR ligands have great potential to treat these diseases. In this study, we searched for novel AR ligands by performing a docking-based virtual screening (VS) on the basis of the crystal structure of the AR ligand binding domain (LBD) in complex with its agonist. A total of 58 structurally diverse compounds were selected and subjected to LBD affinity assay, with five of them (HBP1-3, HBP1-17, HBP1-38, HBP1-51, and HBP1-58) exhibiting strong binding to AR-LBD.

Further bioactivity assays suggest that HBP1-51 is an AR agonist, whereas HBP1-58 is an AR antagonist. In addition, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and principal components analysis (PCA) were carried out to reveal the binding principle of the newly-identified AR ligands toward AR. Our modeling results indicate that the conformational changes of helix 12 induced by the bindings of antagonist and agonist are visibly different.

Our results demonstrate that Z-590 significantly decreases the production of nitric oxide (NO), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, cyclooxygenase (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in inhibiting MAKPs signalling pathway in LPS-stimulated microglia cells. Furthermore, Z-590 reduced cytotoxicity of activated microglia toward HT-22 hippocampal cells in a microglia-conditioned medium system. Taken together, these results indicate that MIF inhibitor Z-590 elicits a potent inhibitor for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.",

Defective graphene is potential material for electronic devices and sensors. Under irradiation or heat treatment, defects may diffuse and aggregate together.

We find that the presence of single-vacancy (SV) defect stimulates the migration of another SV defect to bring them together and form the adjacent single vacancy defects. The adjacent single vacancy defects can combine into a divacancy defect, and we study the path. We also study the structural rearrangement of divacancy defect and conclude the relative stability of different types of divacancy defects.

Currently, a total of 41 kinase inhibitors have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, along with a large number of kinase inhibitors being evaluated in clinical and preclinical trials. Among all, allosteric inhibitors, such as type II kinase inhibitors, have attracted extensive attention owing to their potential high selectivity. Nowadays, molecular docking has become a powerful tool to search for novel kinase inhibitors. However, as for type II kinase inhibitors, their allosteric characteristics may exert a deep influence on docking accuracy. In this study, a comprehensive assessment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of nine docking algorithms towards type II kinase inhibitors. The calculation results showed that most tested docking programs, especially Glide with XP scoring, LeDock and Surflex-Dock, succeeded in the accurate identification of near-native binding poses, with the success rates ranging from 0.80 to 0.90, and the scoring functions in GOLD and LeDock outperformed the others in the prediction of relative binding affinities. In terms of the P-values, areas under the curve and enrichment factors, Glide with XP scoring, Surflex-Dock, GOLD with Astex Statistical Potential scoring and LeDock had better screening power to discriminate between active compounds and decoys. However, the screening power is sensitive to different initial conformations of the same target. It is expected that our study can provide some guidance for docking-based virtual screening to discover novel type II kinase inhibitors, as well as other allosteric inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Androgen receptor (AR), as a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily, regulates the gene transcription in response to the sequential binding of diverse agonists and coactivators. Great progress has been made in studies on the pharmacology and structure of AR, but the atomic level mechanism of the bidirectional communications between the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) and the activation function-2 (AF2) region of AR remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations were carried out to explore the interactions among water, agonist (DHT) or antagonist (HFT), AR, and coactivator (SRC3). Upon the binding of an agonist (DHT) or antagonist (HFT), the LBP structure would transform to the agonistic or antagonistic state, and the conformational changes of the LBP would regulate the structure of the AF2 surface. As a result, the binding of the androgen DHT could promote the recruitment of the coactivator SRC3 to the AF2, and on the contrary, the binding of the antagonist HFT would induce a perturbation to the shape of the AF2 and then weaken its accommodating capability of the coactivators with the LXXLL motif. The simulation results illustrated that the DHT-AR binding affinity was enhanced by the association of the coactivator SRC3, which would reduce the conformational fluctuation of the AR-LBD and expand the size of the AR LBP. On the other hand, the coactivator-to-HFT allosteric pathway, which involves the SRC3, helix 3 (H3), helix 4 (H4), the loop (L1-3) between helix 1 (H1) and H3, and HFT, was characterized. The HFT's skewness and different interactions between HFT and the LBP were observed in the SRC3-present AR. The mutual communications between the AF2 surface and LBP, together with the processes involving the interplay of the ligand binding and coactivator recruitment events, would help in understanding the association of coactivators and rationally develop potent drugs to inhibit the activity of AR.",

Field expressions in terms of similarity indices in CoMSIA were applied instead of the usually used Lennard-Jones and Coulomb-type potentials in CoMFA. Two different kinds of alignment techniques including field-fit alignment and atom-by-atom fits were used to produce the molecular aggregate. The results indicated that those two alignment rules generated comparative 3D-QSAR models with similar statistical significance. However, from the predictive ability of the test set, the models from the alignment after maximal steric and electrostatic optimization were slightly better than those from the simple atom-by-atom fits. Moreover, systematic variations of some parameters in CoMSIA were performed to search the best 3D-QSAR model. A significant cross-validated q2 was obtained, indicating the predictive potential of the model for the untested compounds; meanwhile the predicted biological activities of the five compounds in the test set were in good agreement with the experimental values. The CoMSIA coefficient contour plots identified several key features explaining the wide range of activities, which were very valuable for us in tracing the properties that really matter and getting insight into the potential mechanisms of the intermolecular interactions between inhibitor and receptor, especially with respect to the design of new compounds.",

Currently, SFs relying on sophisticated machine learning techniques have shown great potential in binding affinity prediction and virtual screening. As one of the most indispensable components in the workflow of training a machine learning scoring function (MLSF), the featurization or representation process enables us to catch certain physical processes that are important for protein–ligand interactions and to obtain machine‐readable descriptors. Currently, according to how they are derived, the descriptors used in MLSFs for both continuous and binary binding affinity estimates can be grouped into two broad categories: handcrafted features and automated‐extraction features. Moreover, the automated‐extraction features emerge as a new featurization trend along with the application of deep learning algorithms. Here, we make a thorough summary of the advances in the featurization strategies for protein–ligand interactions in the context of MLSFs, with emphasis on the recently rising automated‐extraction features. We also discuss the similarity between protein–ligand interaction representations and small‐molecule representations, and the challenges confronted by the scientific community in characterizing protein–ligand interactions.

However, clouds of doubts have still been raised against the benefits of this novel type of scoring functions (SFs). In this study, to benchmark the performance of target-specific MLSFs on a relatively unbiased dataset, the MLSFs trained from three representative protein-ligand interaction representations were assessed on the LIT-PCBA dataset, and the classical Glide SP SF and three types of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were also utilized for comparison. Two major aspects in virtual screening campaigns, including prediction accuracy and hit novelty, were systematically explored. The calculation results illustrate that the tested target-specific MLSFs yielded generally superior performance over the classical Glide SP SF, but they could hardly outperform the 2D fingerprint-based QSAR models. Although substantial improvements could be achieved by integrating multiple types of protein-ligand interaction features, the MLSFs were still not sufficient to exceed MACCS-based QSAR models. In terms of the correlations between the hit ranks or the structures of the top-ranked hits, the MLSFs developed by different featurization strategies would have the ability to identify quite different hits. Nevertheless, it seems that target-specific MLSFs do not have the intrinsic attributes of a traditional SF and may not be a substitute for classical SFs. In contrast, MLSFs can be regarded as a new derivative of ligand-based QSAR models. It is expected that our study may provide valuable guidance for the assessment and further development of target-specific MLSFs.",

Using nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, we demonstrate that oxygen vacancies, which are common in TiO2, accelerate nonradiative energy losses by an order of magnitude. Oxygen vacancies produce localized Ti(3+) states hundreds of millielectronvolts below the TiO2 conduction band. The states lower the nanotube band gap, trap excited electrons, induce stronger electron-phonon couplings, and facilitate the relaxation.

Great success has been achieved in developing inhibitors targeting the HCV NS3/4A protease over the past decade, but the rapid emergence of drug resistant mutations greatly compromises the efficacy of antiviral drugs or drug candidates. According to the substrate envelope hypothesis (Romano et al., 2010), severe drug resistant mutations would always occur where the inhibitors protrude from the substrate envelope, defined as a consensus volume occupied by the viral substrates in the active site of the NS3/4A protease. However, the substrate envelope hypothesis just qualitatively assesses the impact of mutations to a specific inhibitor, but no quantitative data is obtained. To remedy the weakness, the dynamic binding patterns of HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors or substrates were investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and continuum solvation binding affinity predictions in this study. By comparing the quantitative binding profiles between the substrates and inhibitors, derived from the free energy decomposition analysis, we observed most residues involved in drug resistance form stronger interactions with the inhibitors than with the substrates, which is roughly coincident with the substrate envelope hypothesis and supports the general mechanism of drug resistance: the critical resistant mutations impair more to the binding of inhibitors than that of substrates. Furthermore, our predictions illustrate that the natural substrates of NS3/4A form balanced interactions with the strands 135-139 and 154-160 whereas the inhibitors cannot. Therefore, to overcome drug resistance, it may be necessary to restore the interaction balance between the two strands and the drug candidates. To our disappointment, the underlying resistant mechanisms of some mutations could not be well captured by just comparing the binding profiles of inhibitors and substrates, and more studies should be proceeded to propose a general drug resistance mechanism.",

AcrB is a homotrimer that acts as a tripartite complex with the outer membrane channel ToIC and the membrane fusion protein AcrA. Recently, the crystal structures of AcrB bound to the high-molecular-mass drugs rifampicin and erythromycin were reported. Here we performed 20 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the AcrB-rifampicin-minocycline complex in a lipid bilayer and explicit water. We found that the bound drugs, rifampicin and erythromycin, made a unidirectional peristaltic movement towards the extrusion funnel of ToIC, which was facilitated by the water efflux in the channel of AcrB. With a shift of the Phe-617 loop, rifampicin in the access monomer moved towards the entrance of the distal binding pocket. Minocycline in the binding monomer moved from the distal binding pocket towards the gate of the central funnel. The channel between the entrance and the gate made a concerted opening during the MD simulations, which was helpful for the peristaltic movement. Our results showed that the mutations of Gly616Pro and Gly619Pro prevented the movement of the Phe-617 loop, which indicated the critical role of the flexibility of the Phe-617 loop. In addition, three putative proton translocation channels were proposed based on our results.

Allosteric inhibitors can stabilize an active conformation of PTP1B by hindering the conformational transition of the WPD loop of PTP1B from the open to the closed state. Here, the umbrella sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to compute the reaction path of the conformational transition of PTP1B, and the snapshots extracted from the MD trajectory were clustered into 58 conformational groups based on the key conformational parameter. Then, the impact of the conformational change of the WPD loop on the interactions between the allosteric site of PTP1B and an allosteric inhibitor BB3 was explored by using the MM/GBSA binding free energy calculations and free energy decomposition analysis. The simulation results show that the binding free energy of BB3 increases gradually from the open to the closed conformation of the WPD loop, providing the molecular mechanism of allosteric inhibition. Correlation analysis of the different energy terms indicates that the allosteric inhibitor with more negative van der Waals contribution cannot only exhibit stronger binding affinity but also hinder the swing of the WPD loop more effectively. Besides, it is found that the energy contribution of Lys292 in the α7 helix undergoes significant change, which reveals that Lys292 is not only the key residue for ligand binding but also plays an important role in hindering the conformational change of the WPD loop.",

First, the representative structures for each kinase target were chosen by structural clustering of available crystal structures.

Finally, the performance of molecular docking to identify the dual-target kinase inhibitors for four kinase pairs was evaluated. The analyses show that molecular docking successfully filters out most noninhibitors and achieves promising performance for identifying dual-kinase inhibitors for CDK2-GSK3B and Lck-VEGFR2. But a high false-positive rate leads to low enrichment of true dual-target inhibitors in the final list.

First, molecular docking was used to predict the binding modes of inhibitors in the binding site of MIF. The good correlation between the predicted docking scores and the experimental activities shows that the binding conformations of the inhibitors in the active site of MIF are well predicted. Moreover, our results suggest that the flexibility of MIF is essential in ligand binding process. Then, MD simulations and MM/GBSA free energy calculations were employed to determine the dynamic binding process and compare the binding modes of the inhibitors with different activities. The predicted binding free energies given by MM/GBSA are not well correlated with the experimental activities for the two subsets of the inhibitors; however, for each subset, a good correlation between the predicted binding free energies and the experimental activities is achieved. The MM/GBSA free energy decomposition analysis highlights the importance of hydrophobic residues for the MIF binding of the studied inhibitors. Based on the essential factors for MIF-inhibitor interactions derived from the theoretical predictions, some derivatives were designed and the higher inhibitory activities of several candidates were confirmed by molecular docking studies.

However, an accurate estimation of protein-ligand binding affinity still remains a challenge due to the intrinsic limitation of the standard generalized Born (GB) model used in MM/GBSA. In this study, we proposed and evaluated the MM/GBSA approach based on a variable dielectric generalized Born (VDGB) model using residue-type-based dielectric constants. In the VDGB model, different dielectric values were assigned for the three types of protein residues, and the magnitude of the dielectric constants for residue types follows this order: charged ≥ polar ≥ nonpolar. We found that MM/GBSA based on a VDGB model (MM/GBSAVDGB) with an optimal dielectric constant of 4.0 for the charged residues and 1.0 for the noncharged residues together with a net-charge-dependent dielectric value for ligands achieved better predictions as judged by Pearson's correlation coefficient than the standard MM/GBSA with a uniform solute dielectric constant of 4.0 for the training set of 130 protein-ligand complexes. The prediction on the test set with 165 protein-ligand complexes also validated the better performance of MM/GBSAVDGB. Moreover, this method exhibited potential in predicting the relative binding free energies for multiple ligands against the same target.

The discovery of drug candidates that act on new targets of PD is required to address the varied pathological aspects and modify the disease process. In this study, a small compound, 2-(5-methyl-1-benzofuran-3-yl)-N-(5-propylsulfanyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl) acetamide (MBPTA) was identified as a novel Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor with significant protective effects against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+))-induced damage in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Further investigation showed that pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with MBPTA significantly suppressed MPP(+)-induced cell death by restoring abnormal changes in nuclear morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential, and numerous apoptotic regulators. MBPTA was able to inhibit MPP(+)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)/NO generation, overexpression of inducible NO synthase, and activation of NF-κB, indicating the critical role of MBPTA in regulating ROS/NO-mediated cell death. Furthermore, MBPTA was shown to activate PI3K/Akt survival signaling, and its cytoprotective effect was abolished by PI3K and Akt inhibitors. The structural comparison of a series of MBPTA analogs revealed that the benzofuran moiety probably plays a crucial role in the anti-oxidative stress action. Taken together, these results suggest that MBPTA protects against MPP(+)-induced apoptosis in a neuronal cell line through inhibition of ROS/NO generation and activation of PI3K/Akt signaling.",

        "abstract": "The activation of pregnane X receptor (PXR), a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily, can mediate potential drug-drug interactions, and therefore, prediction of PXR activation is of great importance for evaluating drug metabolism and toxicity. In this study, based on 532 structurally diverse compounds, we present a comprehensive analysis with the aim to build accurate classification models for distinguishing PXR activators from nonactivators by using a naive Bayesian classification technique. First, the distributions of eight important molecular physicochemical properties of PXR activators versus nonactivators were compared, illustrating that the hydrophobicity-related molecular descriptors (AlogP and log D) show slightly better capability to discriminate PXR activators from nonactivators than the others. Then, based on molecular physicochemical properties, VolSurf descriptors, and molecular fingerprints, naive Bayesian classifiers were developed to separate PXR activators from nonactivators. The results demonstrate that the introduction of molecular fingerprints is quite essential to enhance the prediction accuracy of the classifiers. The best Bayesian classifier based on the 21 physicochemical properties, VolSurf descriptors, and LCFC_10 fingerprints descriptors yields a prediction accuracy of 92.7% for the training set based on leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation and of 85.2% for the test set. Moreover, by exploring the important structural fragments derived from the best Bayesian classifier, we observed that flexibility is an important structural pattern for PXR activation. In addition, chemical compounds containing more halogen atoms, unsaturated alkanes chains relevant to π-π stacking, and fewer nitrogen atoms tend to be PXR activators. We believe that the naive Bayesian classifier can be used as a reliable virtual screening tool to predict PXR activation in the drug design and discovery pipeline.",

Recently, high resolution X-ray crystal structures of mouse P-gp (inward-facing) were reported, which significantly facilitates the understanding of the function of P-gp and the structure-based design of inhibitors for P-gp. Here we perform 20 ns molecular dynamics simulations of inward-facing P-gp with/without ligand in explicit lipid and water to investigate the flexibility of P-gp for its poly-specific drug binding. By analyzing the interactions between P-gp and QZ59-RRR or QZ59-SSS, we summarize the important residues and the flexibility of different parts of P-gp. Particularly, the flexibility of the side chains of aromatic residues (Phe and Tyr) allows them to form rotamers with different orientations in the binding pocket, which plays a critical role for the poly-specificity of the drug-binding cavity of P-gp. MD simulations reveal that trans-membrane (TM) TM12 and TM6 are flexible and contribute to the poly-specific drug binding, while TM4 and TM5 are rigid and stabilize the whole structure. We also construct outward-facing P-gp based on the MsbA structure and perform 20 ns MD simulations. The comparison between the MD results for outward-facing P-gp and those for inward-facing P-gp shows that the TM parts in outward-facing P-gp undergo significant conformational change to facilitate the export of small molecules.",

To understand the allosteric communication within the GR ligand binding domain, the folding pathway of helix 12 (H12) induced by the binding of the agonist dexamethasone (DEX), antagonist RU486, and modulator AZD9567 are explored by molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state model analysis. The ligands can regulate the volume of the activation function-2 through the residues Phe737 and Gln738. Without ligand or with agonist binding, H12 swings from inward to outward to visit different folding positions. However, the binding of RU486 or AZD9567 perturbs the structural state, and the passive antagonist state appears more stable.

In this study, the crystalline water molecules in BRD4 involved in ligand binding were analyzed first, and the simulation results suggest that several conserved crystalline water molecules are quite essential to keep the stability of the crystalline water network and therefore they need to be reserved in structure-based drug design. Then, a docking-based virtual screening workflow with the consideration of the conserved crystalline water network in the binding pocket was utilized to identify the potential inhibitors of BRD4. The in vitro fluorescence resonance energy transfer (HTRF) binding assay illustrates that 4 hits have good inhibitory activity against BRD4 in the micromolar regime, including three compounds with IC50 values below 5 μM and one below 1 μM (0.37 μM). The structural analysis demonstrates that three active compounds possess novel scaffolds.

Therefore, computational techniques, such as homology modeling, have been widely used to produce the theoretical structures of various GPCRs for structure-based drug design (SBDD). Due to the low sequence similarity shared by the transmembrane domains of GPCRs, accurate prediction of GPCR structures by homology modeling is quite challenging. In this study, angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) was taken as a typical case to assess the reliability of class A GPCR homology models for SBDD. Four homology models of angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) at the inactive state were built based on the crystal structures of CXCR4 chemokine receptor, CCR5 chemokine receptor, and δ-opioid receptor, and refined through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and induced-fit docking, to allow for backbone and side-chain flexibility. Then, the quality of the homology models was assessed relative to the crystal structures in terms of two criteria commonly used in SBDD: prediction accuracy of ligand-binding poses and screening power of docking-based virtual screening. It was found that the crystal structures outperformed the homology models prior to any refinement in both assessments. MD simulations could generally improve the docking results for both the crystal structures and homology models. Moreover, the optimized homology model refined by MD simulations and induced-fit docking even shows a similar performance of the docking assessment to the crystal structures.

Traditional feature-engineering approaches heavily rely on handcrafted descriptors and/or fingerprints, which need extensive human expert knowledge. With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence technology, data-driven deep learning methods have shown unparalleled advantages over feature-engineering-based methods. However, existing deep learning methods usually suffer from the scarcity of labeled data and the inability to share information between different tasks when applied to predicting molecular properties, thus resulting in poor generalization capability. Here, we proposed a novel multitask learning BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer) framework, named MTL-BERT, which leverages large-scale pre-training, multitask learning, and SMILES (simplified molecular input line entry specification) enumeration to alleviate the data scarcity problem. MTL-BERT first exploits a large amount of unlabeled data through self-supervised pretraining to mine the rich contextual information in SMILES strings and then fine-tunes the pretrained model for multiple downstream tasks simultaneously by leveraging their shared information. Meanwhile, SMILES enumeration is used as a data enhancement strategy during the pretraining, fine-tuning, and test phases to substantially increase data diversity and help to learn the key relevant patterns from complex SMILES strings. The experimental results showed that the pretrained MTL-BERT model with few additional fine-tuning can achieve much better performance than the state-of-the-art methods on most of the 60 practical molecular datasets. Additionally, the MTL-BERT model leverages attention mechanisms to focus on SMILES character features essential to target properties for model interpretability.",

Traditional feature-engineering approaches heavily rely on expert knowledge to devise useful features, which could be costly and sometimes biased. The emerging deep learning (DL) methods deliver a data-driven method to automatically learn expressive representations from complex raw data. Inspired by this, researchers have attempted to apply various deep neural network models to simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES) strings, which contain all the composition and structure information of molecules. However, current models usually suffer from the scarcity of labeled data. This results in a low generalization ability of SMILES-based DL models, which prevents them from competing with the state-of-the-art computational methods. In this study, we utilized the BiLSTM (bidirectional long short term merory) attention network (BAN) in which we employed a novel multi-step attention mechanism to facilitate the extracting of key features from the SMILES strings. Meanwhile, SMILES enumeration was utilized as a data augmentation method in the training phase to substantially increase the number of labeled data and enlarge the probability of mining more patterns from complex SMILES. We again took advantage of SMILES enumeration in the prediction phase to rectify model prediction bias and provide a more accurate prediction. Combined with the BAN model, our strategies can greatly improve the performance of latent features learned from SMILES strings. In 11 canonical absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity-related tasks, our method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "title": "Identification of active molecules against Mycobacterium tuberculosis through machine learning",
        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and it has been one of the top 10 causes of death globally. Drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), extensively resistant to the commonly used first-line drugs, has emerged as a major challenge to TB treatment. Hence, it is quite necessary to discover novel drug candidates for TB treatment. In this study, based on different types of molecular representations, four machine learning (ML) algorithms, including support vector machine, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and deep neural networks (DNN), were used to develop classification models to distinguish Mtb inhibitors from noninhibitors. The results demonstrate that the XGBoost model exhibits the best prediction performance. Then, two consensus strategies were employed to integrate the predictions from multiple models. The evaluation results illustrate that the consensus model by stacking the RF, XGBoost and DNN predictions offers the best predictions with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.842 and 0.942 for the 10-fold cross-validated training set and external test set, respectively. Besides, the association between the important descriptors and the bioactivities of molecules was interpreted by using the Shapley additive explanations method. Finally, an online webserver called ChemTB (http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/chemtb/) was developed, and it offers a freely available computational tool to detect potential Mtb inhibitors.",

        "title": "Prediction of luciferase inhibitors by the high-performance MIEC-GBDT approach based on interaction energetic patterns",
        "abstract": "High-throughput screening (HTS) is widely applied in many fields ranging from drug discovery to clinical diagnostics and toxicity assessment. Firefly luciferase is commonly used as a reporter to monitor the effect of chemical compounds on the activity of a specific target or pathway in HTS. However, the false positive rate of luciferase-based HTS is relatively high because many artifacts or promiscuous compounds that have direct interaction with the luciferase reporter enzyme are usually identified as active compounds (hits). Therefore, it is necessary to develop a rapid screening method to identify these compounds that can inhibit the luciferase activity directly. In this study, a virtual screening (VS) classification model called MIEC-GBDT (MIEC: Molecular Interaction Energy Components; GBDT: Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) was developed to distinguish luciferase inhibitors from non-inhibitors. The MIECs calculated by Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) free energy decomposition were used to energetically characterize the binding pattern of each small molecule at the active site of luciferase, and then the GBDT algorithm was employed to construct the classifiers based on MIECs. The predictions to the test set show that the optimized MIEC-GBDT model outperformed molecular docking and MM/GBSA rescoring. The best MIEC-GBDT model based on the MIECs with the energy terms of ΔGele, ΔGvdW, ΔGGB, and ΔGSA achieves the prediction accuracies of 87.2% and 90.3% for the inhibitors and non-inhibitors in the test sets, respectively. Moreover, the energetic analysis of the vital residues suggests that the energetic contributions of the vital residues to the binding of inhibitors are quite different from those to the binding of non-inhibitors. These results suggest that the MIEC-GBDT model is reliable and can be used as a powerful tool to identify potential interference compounds in luciferase-based HTS experiments.",

Although some current medicines may temporarily improve their symptoms, no treatments can slow or halt the progression of neuronal death. In this study, a pyrimidine derivative, benzyl 7-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-5-methyl-4,7-dihydrotetrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate (BHDPC), was found to attenuate dramatically the MPTP-induced death of dopaminergic neurons and improve behavior movement deficiency in zebrafish, supporting its potential neuroprotective activity in vivo. Further study in rat organotypic cerebellar cultures indicated that BHDPC was able to suppress MPP(+)-induced cell death of brain tissue slices ex vivo. The protective effect of BHDPC against MPP(+) toxicity was also effective in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells through restoring abnormal changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and numerous apoptotic regulators. Western blotting analysis indicated that BHDPC was able to activate PKA/CREB survival signaling and further up-regulate Bcl2 expression. However, BHDPC failed to suppress MPP(+)-induced cytotoxicity and the increase of caspase 3 activity in the presence of the PKA inhibitor H89. Taken together, these results suggest that BHDPC is a potential neuroprotectant with prosurvival effects in multiple models of neurodegenerative disease in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a multi-functional protein that acts as a cytokine and as an enzyme. Recently, MIF was identified as a non-canonical ligand of G protein-coupled chemokine receptor CXCR2 with low nanomolar affinity in leukocyte arrest and chemotaxis, but the precise knowledge of the molecular determinants of the MIF-CXCR2 interface has remained unknown. Therefore, we employed homology modeling, protein-protein docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy calculations and MM/GBSA binding free energy decomposition to obtain insights into the molecular recognition of MIF with CXCR2. The predicted binding pattern of MIF-CXCR2 is in good agreement with the experimental data and sheds light on the functional role of important MIF-CXCR2 interface residues in association with binding and signaling. According to our predictions, the R11A/D44A double mutations of MIF exhibit a pronounced defect in the binding affinity of MIF to CXCR2, resulting in large conformational changes. The potential two-site binding model for the MIF-CXCR2 recognition was proposed: initialized primarily by the non-polar interactions including the van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions, the N-terminal region of CXCR2 contacts the N-like loop and β-sheet of MIF (site 1), and then the ECL2 and ECL3 regions of CXCR2 form strong interactions with the pseudo-(E)LR motif and C-terminus of MIF, which induces the molecular thermodynamic motion of TMs for signal transduction (site 2). This study will extend our understanding to the binding mechanisms of MIF to CXCR2 and provide useful information for the rational design of potent inhibitors selectively targeting the MIF-CXCR2 interactions.",

The three-stage model consists of the following components: (1) encoders for the protein and ligand to learn the representations of intramolecular interactions; (2) E(n) equivariant graph neural networks with self-attention to update the ligand pose based on both protein-ligand and intramolecular interactions, followed by post-processing to ensure chemically plausible structures; (3) a mixture density network for scoring the binding strength.

Selecting an optimal screening library for a specific VS campaign is quite important to improve the success rates and avoid wasting resources in later experimental phases. Analysis of the structural features and molecular diversity for different screening libraries can provide valuable information to the decision making process when selecting screening libraries for VS. In this study, the structural features and scaffold diversity of eleven purchasable screening libraries and Traditional Chinese Medicine Compound Database (TCMCD) were analyzed and compared. Their scaffold diversity represented by the Murcko frameworks and Level 1 scaffolds was characterized by the scaffold counts and cumulative scaffold frequency plots, and visualized by Tree Maps and SAR Maps. The analysis demonstrates that, based on the standardized subsets with similar molecular weight distributions, Chembridge, ChemicalBlock, Mucle, TCMCD and VitasM are more structurally diverse than the others. Compared with all purchasable screening libraries, TCMCD has the highest structural complexity indeed but more conservative molecular scaffolds. Moreover, we found that some representative scaffolds were important components of drug candidates against different drug targets, such as kinases and guanosine-binding protein coupled receptors, and therefore the molecules containing pharmacologically important scaffolds found in screening libraries might be potential inhibitors against the relevant targets. This study may provide valuable perspective on which purchasable compound libraries are better for you to screen. Graphical abstract Selecting diverse compound libraries with scaffold analyses.",

The key to photocatalysis field is to search materials with suitable oxidizing and reducing potential. Herein we investigated the novel 2D γ-phosphorus nitride (γ-PN) monolayer as a candidate photocatalyst for reducing water into hydrogen and oxygen from the first-principles and molecular dynamics calculations. Our results show that the 2D γ-PN monolayer is an indirect semiconductor whose conduction and valence band edges matches well with the chemical potential of H+/H2 and O2/H2O. Strain effect is considered to tune the electronic properties of γ-PN. The calculation results reveal that tensile strain decreases the band gap and upshifts the work function of the γ-PN monolayer. The γ-PN monolayer at the 10% tensile strain shows the optimal performance in catalysing the water-splitting due to the low band gap and the better absorption spectrum at the UV-visible light range. Furthermore, the molecular dynamics shows that the γ-PN in the aqueous solution always keep stable after 100 ps simulation. Both the density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation reflect that the γ-PN monolayer is reliable and promising as a water-splitting photocatalyst.",

Sampling is used to generate a number of plausible protein-protein binding conformations and scoring can rank all those conformations. Due to large and flexible binding interface of PPI, determination of the near native structures is computationally expensive, and therefore computational efficiency is the most challenging issue in protein-protein docking. Here, we have reviewed the basic concepts and implementations of the sampling, scoring and acceleration algorithms in some established docking programs, and the limitations of these algorithms have been discussed.

We find that the density of water molecules in the trans-membrane domain under reduced state is bigger than that under oxidized state. The connecting elements (helix HL and β-hairpins-helix element) fluctuate stronger under reduced state than that under oxidized state, causing more internal water molecules and facilitating the proton conduction. The conformational changes of helix HL and the crucial charged residue Glu in TM5 play key roles in the mechanism of proton translocation.

In our docking procedure, surface complementarity and energetic complementarity of a ligand with its receptor have been considered separately in a two-stage docking method. The first stage was to find a set of potential associated sites mainly based on surface complementarity using a genetic algorithm combined with a tabu search. This step corresponds with the process of finding the potential binding sites where pharmacophores will bind. In the second stage, several hundreds of GA minimization steps were performed for each associated site derived from the first stage mainly based on the energetic complementarity. After calculations for both of the two stages, we can offer several solutions of associated sites for every complex. In this paper, seven biomolecular systems, including five bound complexes and two unbound complexes, were chosen from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to test our method. The calculated results were very encouraging-the hybrid minimization algorithm successfully reaches the correct solutions near the best binded modes for these protein complexes. The docking results not only predict the bound complexes very well, but also get a relatively accurate complexed conformation for unbound systems. For the five bound complexes, the results show that surface complementarity is enough to find the precise binding modes, the top solution from the tabu list generally corresponds to the correct binding mode. For the two unbound complexes, due to the conformational changes upon binding, it seems more difficult to get their correct binding conformations. The predicted results show that the correct binding mode also corresponds to a relatively large surface complementarity score. In these two test cases, the correct solution can be found in the top several solutions from the tabu list. For unbound complexes, the interaction energy from energetic complementarity is very important, it can be used to filter these solutions from the surface complementarity. After the evaluation of the energetic complementarity, the conformations and orientations close to the crystallographically determined structures are resolved. In most cases, the smallest root mean square distance (r.m.s.d.) from the GA combined with TA solutions is in a relatively small region. Our program of automatic docking is really a universal one among the procedures used for the theoretical study of molecular recognition.",

Recently, aggregated SWCNTs have shown more significant effects on the treatment of methamphetamine addiction (Nat. Nanotech. 2016, 11, 613). However, the mechanisms underlying these actions are unclear. By using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the effects of single and aggregated SWCNTs (single-(10,10)CNT, aggregated-7-(10,10)CNTs, and single-(35,35)CNT with the same diameter as that of the aggregated one) on the activity of dopamine-related proteins [tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrOH) and dopamine transporter (DAT), which are related to the synthesis and transport of dopamine, respectively]. We find that both TyrOH and DAT can adsorb onto these SWCNTs. For TyrOH, the aggregated-7-(10,10)CNTs mainly affect the conformation of the active site of the protein, and hence, they are more effective in inhibiting the expression of TyrOH. For DAT, our results suggest that the aggregated-7-(10,10)CNTs allow DAT to maintain an outward-facing conformation and hence are favorable to the reuptake of dopamine. The binding of a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, [3H]-WIN35,428, to DAT is significantly disrupted by aggregated-7-(10,10)CNTs and hence improve the ability to transport dopamine.

Here, we report, for the first time, the discovery, via structure-based virtual screen and chemical optimization, of such a small molecule, designated as HA-9104. HA-9104 binds to UBE2F, reduces its protein levels, and consequently inhibits cullin-5 neddylation. Blockage of cullin-5 neddylation inactivates cullin-RING ligase-5 (CRL5) activity, leading to accumulation of the CRL5 substrate, NOXA, to induce apoptosis. Moreover, HA-9104 appears to form the DNA adduct via its 7-azaindole group to induce DNA damage and G2/M arrest. Biologically, HA-9104 effectively suppresses the growth and survival of lung cancer cells and confers radiosensitization in both in vitro cell culture and in vivo xenograft tumor models.

A series of complex pathophysiological cascades contribute to the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, and no therapies have proven effective to prevent hemorrhagic stroke. Stabilization of vascular integrity has been considered as a potential therapeutic target for hemorrhagic stroke. ROCKs, which belong to the serine/threonine protein kinase family and participate in the organization of actin cytoskeleton, have become attractive targets for the treatment of strokes. In this study, in vitro enzyme-based assays revealed that a new compound (FPND) with a novel scaffold identified by docking-based virtual screening could inhibit ROCK1 specifically at low micromolar concentration. Molecular modeling showed that FPND preferentially interacted with ROCK1, and the difference between the binding affinity of FPND toward ROCK1 and ROCK2 primarily resulted from non-polar contributions. Furthermore, FPND significantly prevented statin-induced cerebral hemorrhage in a zebrafish model. In addition, in vitro studies using the xCELLigence RTCA system, immunofluorescence and western blotting revealed that FPND prevented statin-induced cerebral hemorrhage by enhancing endothelial cell-cell junctions through inhibiting the ROCK-mediated VE-cadherin signaling pathway. As indicated by the extremely low toxicity of FPND against mice, it is safe and can potentially prevent vascular integrity loss-related diseases, such as hemorrhagic stroke.",

Molecular docking analysis revealed that C98 interfered with the ATP-binding pockets of PI3Ks by forming H-bonds and arene-H interactions with specific amino acid residues. The cellular assays demonstrated that C98 specifically inhibited PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, but had no effects on other kinases and proteins including IGF-1R, ERK, p38, c-Src, PTEN, and STAT3. Inhibition of PI3K by C98 led to myeloma cell apoptosis. Furthermore, oral administration of C98 delayed tumor growth in two independent human myeloma xenograft models in nude mice but did not show overt toxicity.

        "abstract": "Determination of the binding motif and identification of interaction partners of the modular domains such as SH2 domains can enhance our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of protein-protein interactions. We propose here a new computational method to achieve this goal by integrating the orthogonal information obtained from binding free energy estimation and peptide sequence analysis. We performed a proof-of-concept study on the SH2 domains of SAP and Grb2 proteins. The method involves the following steps: (1) estimating the binding free energy of a set of randomly selected peptides along with a sample of known binders; (2) clustering all these peptides using sequence and energy characteristics; (3) extracting a sequence motif, which is represented by a hidden Markov model (HMM), from the cluster of peptides containing the sample of known binders; and (4) scanning the human proteome to identify binding sites of the domain. The binding motifs of the SAP and Grb2 SH2 domains derived by the method agree well with those determined through experimental studies. Using the derived binding motifs, we have predicted new possible interaction partners for the Grb2 and SAP SH2 domains as well as possible interaction sites for interaction partners already known. We also suggested novel roles for the proteins by reviewing their top interaction candidates.",

Currently, comprehensive DDI evaluation has become a major challenge in pharmaceutical research due to the time-consuming and costly process of the experimental assessment and it is of high necessity to develop effective in silico methods to predict and evaluate DDIs accurately and efficiently. In this study, based on a large number of substrates and inhibitors related to five important CYP450 isozymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4), a series of high-performance predictive models for metabolic DDIs were constructed by two machine learning methods (random forest and XGBoost) and 4 different types of descriptors (MOE_2D, CATS, ECFP4 and MACCS). To reduce the uncertainty of individual models, the consensus method was applied to yield more reliable predictions. A series of evaluations illustrated that the consensus models were more reliable and robust for the DDI predictions of new drug combination. For the internal validation, the whole prediction accuracy and AUC value of the DDI models were around 0.8 and 0.9, respectively. When it was applied to the external datasets, the model accuracy was 0.793 and 0.795 for multi-level validation and external validation, respectively. Furthermore, we also compared our model with some recently published tools and then applied the final model to predict FDA-approved drugs and proposed 54,013 possible drug pairs with potential DDIs. In summary, we developed a powerful DDI predictive model from the perspective of the CYP450 enzyme family and it will help a lot in the future drug development and clinical pharmacy research.",

In this study, the inhibition mechanism of 41 pyrrolopyrimidine derivatives as LIMK2 inhibitors was explored through a series of theoretical approaches. First, a model of LIMK2 was generated through molecular homology modeling, and the studied inhibitors were docked into the binding active site of LIMK2 by the docking protocol, taking into consideration the flexibility of the protein. The binding poses predicted by molecular docking for 17 selected inhibitors with different bioactivities complexed with LIMK2 underwent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and the binding free energies for the complexes were predicted by using the molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) method. The predicted binding free energies correlated well with the experimental bioactivities (r(2) = 0.63 or 0.62). Next, the free energy decomposition analysis was utilized to highlight the following key structural features related to biological activity: (1) the important H-bond between Ile408 and pyrrolopyrimidine, (2) the H-bonds between the inhibitors and Asp469 and Gly471 which maintain the stability of the DFG-out conformation, and (3) the hydrophobic interactions between the inhibitors and several key residues (Leu337, Phe342, Ala345, Val358, Lys360, Leu389, Ile408, Leu458 and Leu472). Finally, a variety of LIMK2 inhibitors with a pyrrolopyrimidine scaffold were designed, some of which showed improved potency according to the predictions. Our studies suggest that the use of molecular docking with MD simulations and free energy calculations could be a powerful tool for understanding the binding mechanism of LIMK2 inhibitors and for the design of more potent LIMK2 inhibitors.",

In the present study, we performed a virtual screen against 800,000 of small molecule compounds by targeting PI3Kγ. C96, one of such compounds, inhibited PI3K activated by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), but did not suppress IGF-1R activation. The cell-free assay revealed that C96 preferred to inhibit PI3Kα and δ, but was not active against AKT1, 2, 3 or mTOR. C96 inhibited PI3K activation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Consistent with its inhibition on PI3K/AKT, C96 downregulated the activation of mTOR, p70S6K, 4E-BP1, but did not suppress other kinases such as ERK and c-Src. Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by C96 led to MM cell apoptosis which was demonstrated by Annexin V staining and activation of the pro-apoptotic signals. Furthermore, C96 displayed potent anti-myeloma activity in a MM xenograft model in nude mice. Oral administration of 100 mg/kg bodyweight almost fully suppressed tumor growth within 16 days, but without gross toxicity. Importantly, AKT activation was suppressed in tumor tissues from C96-treated mice, which was consistent with delayed tumor growth. Thus, we identified a novel PI3K inhibitor with a great potential for MM therapy.",

As both receptors dimerize with RXR, and natural PPARgamma ligands activate RXR, DIM-Ph-4-CF(3) was investigated as an RXR ligand. It displaces 9-cis-retinoic acid from RXRalpha but does not activate RXRalpha. Structure-based direct design led to an RXRalpha agonist.1-Di(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl-4-trifluoromethylbenzene (DIM-Ph-4-CF(3)) is reported to inhibit cancer cell growth and to act as a transcriptional agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and nuclear receptor 4A subfamily member 1 (NR4A1). In addition, DIM-Ph-4-CF(3) exerts anticancer effects independent of these receptors because PPARgamma antagonists do not block its inhibition of cell growth, and the small pocket in the NR4A1 crystal structure suggests no ligand can bind. Because PPARgamma and NR4A1 heterodimerize with retinoid X receptor (RXR), and several PPARgamma ligands transcriptionally activate RXR, DIM-Ph-4-CF(3) was investigated as an RXR ligand. DIM-Ph-4-CF(3) displaces 9-cis-retinoic acid from RXRalpha but does not transactivate RXRalpha.

Its docked pose in the RXRalpha ligand binding domain suggests that binding is stabilized by interactions of its carboxylate group with arginine 316, its indoles with cysteines 269 and 432, and its 1-methyl groups with hydrophobic residues lining the binding pocket. As is expected of a selective activator of RXRalpha, but not of RARs and PPARgamma, this RXRalpha agonist, unlike DIM-Ph-4-CF(3), does not appreciably decrease cancer cell growth or induce apoptosis at pharmacologically relevant concentrations.",

The interaction between virus RNA and host protein (IVRHP) is unique compared to other virus-host molecular interactions and represents not only an attempt by viruses to promote their translation/replication, but also the host's endeavor to combat viral pathogenicity. In other words, there is an urgent need to develop a database for providing such IVRHP data. In this study, a new database was therefore constructed to describe the interactions between coronavirus RNAs and host proteins (CovInter). This database is unique in (a) unambiguously characterizing the interactions between virus RNA and host protein, (b) comprehensively providing experimentally validated biological function for hundreds of host proteins key in viral infection and (c) systematically quantifying the differential expression patterns (before and after infection) of these key proteins. Given the devastating and persistent threat of coronaviruses, CovInter is highly expected to fill the gap in the whole process of the 'molecular arms race' between viruses and their hosts, which will then aid in the discovery of new antiviral therapies.

Recently, the crystal structure of human dopamine D3 receptor was reported, which facilitates structure-based drug discovery of D3R significantly. We dock D3R-selective compounds into the crystal structure of D3R and homology structure of D2R. Then we perform 20 ns molecular dynamics (MD) of the receptor with selective compounds bound in explicit lipid and water. Our docking and MD results indicate the important residues related to the selectivity of D3R. Specifically, residue Thr(7.39) in D3R may contribute to the high selectivity of R-22 with D3R. Meanwhile, the 4-carbon linker and phenylpiperazine of R-22 improve the binding affinity and the selectivity with D3R. We also dock the agonists, including dopamine, into D3R and perform MD. Our molecular dynamics results of D3R with agonist bound show strong conformational changes from TM5, TM6, and TM7, outward movement of intracellular part of TM6, fluctuation of \"ionic lock\" motif and conformational change of Tyr(7.53), which is consistent with recent crystal structures of active GPCRs and illustrates the dynamical process during activation.

Recently, the discovery of inhibitors that block a single isoform of PI3K has continued to attract special attention because they may have higher selectivity for certain tumors and less toxicity for healthy cells. The PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ share fewer studies than α/γ, and therefore, in this work, the combination of molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations was employed to explore the binding of three isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors (COM8, IC87114, and GDC-0941) to PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ. The isoform specificities of the studied inhibitors derived from the predicted binding free energies are in good agreement with the experimental data. In addition, the key residues critical for PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ selectivity were highlighted by decomposing the binding free energies into the contributions from individual residues. It was observed that although PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ share the conserved ATP-binding pockets, individual residues do behave differently, particularly the residues critical for PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ selectivity. It can be concluded that the inhibitor specificity between PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ is determined by the additive contributions from multiple residues, not just a single one. This study provides valuable information for understanding the isoform-specific binding mechanisms of PI3K inhibitors, and should be useful for the rational design of novel and selective PI3K inhibitors.",

Here, inspired by stochastic dynamics and recent advances in generative modeling, we developed SDEGen, a novel conformation generation model based on stochastic differential equations. Compared with existing conformation generation methods, it enjoys the following advantages: (1) high model capacity to capture multimodal conformation distribution, thereby searching for multiple low-energy conformations of a molecule quickly, (2) higher conformation generation efficiency, almost ten times faster than the state-of-the-art score-based model, ConfGF, and (3) a clear physical interpretation to learn how a molecule evolves in a stochastic dynamics system starting from noise and eventually relaxing to the conformation that falls in low energy minima. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDEGen has surpassed existing methods in different tasks for conformation generation, interatomic distance distribution prediction, and thermodynamic property estimation, showing great potential for real-world applications.",

Hereby, we developed a new approach named Topology-based and Conformation-based decoys generation (TocoDecoy), which integrates two strategies to generate decoys by tweaking the actives for a specific target, to generate unbiased and expandable datasets for training and benchmarking MLSFs. For hidden bias evaluation, the performance of InteractionGraphNet (IGN) trained on the TocoDecoy, LIT-PCBA, and DUD-E-like datasets was assessed. The results illustrate that the IGN model trained on the TocoDecoy dataset is competitive with that trained on the LIT-PCBA dataset but remarkably outperforms that trained on the DUD-E dataset, suggesting that the decoys in TocoDecoy are unbiased for training and benchmarking MLSFs.",

The results provide a chemical insight into the interactions between inhibitor and enzyme, and can indicate changes in the inhibitor that would enhance inhibitor-enzyme interactions.",

        "abstract": "Computational approaches are useful tools to interpret and guide experiments to expedite the antibiotic drug design process. Structure-based drug design (SBDD) and ligand-based drug design (LBDD) are the two general types of computer-aided drug design (CADD) approaches in existence. SBDD methods analyze macromolecular target 3-dimensional structural information, typically of proteins or RNA, to identify key sites and interactions that are important for their respective biological functions. Such information can then be utilized to design antibiotic drugs that can compete with essential interactions involving the target and thus interrupt the biological pathways essential for survival of the microorganism(s). LBDD methods focus on known antibiotic ligands for a target to establish a relationship between their physiochemical properties and antibiotic activities, referred to as a structure-activity relationship (SAR), information that can be used for optimization of known drugs or guide the design of new drugs with improved activity. In this chapter, standard CADD protocols for both SBDD and LBDD will be presented with a special focus on methodologies and targets routinely studied in our laboratory for antibiotic drug discoveries.",

        "abstract": "Binding affinity prediction largely determines the discovery efficiency of lead compounds in drug discovery. Recently, machine learning (ML)-based approaches have attracted much attention in hopes of enhancing the predictive performance of traditional physics-based approaches. In this study, we evaluated the impact of structural dynamic information on the binding affinity prediction by comparing the models trained on different dimensional descriptors, using three targets (i.e. JAK1, TAF1-BD2 and DDR1) and their corresponding ligands as the examples. Here, 2D descriptors are traditional ECFP4 fingerprints, 3D descriptors are the energy terms of the Smina and NNscore scoring functions and 4D descriptors contain the structural dynamic information derived from the trajectories based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We systematically investigate the MD-refined binding affinity prediction performance of three classical ML algorithms (i.e. RF, SVR and XGB) as well as two common virtual screening methods, namely Glide docking and MM/PBSA. The outcomes of the ML models built using various dimensional descriptors and their combinations reveal that the MD refinement with the optimized protocol can improve the predictive performance on the TAF1-BD2 target with considerable structural flexibility, but not for the less flexible JAK1 and DDR1 targets, when taking docking poses as the initial structure instead of the crystal structures. The results highlight the importance of the initial structures to the final performance of the model through conformational analysis on the three targets with different flexibility.",

Selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators (SGRMs) are expected to have promising anti-inflammatory efficacy but with fewer side effects caused by GCs. Here, we reported HT-15, a prospective SGRM discovered by structure-based virtual screening (VS) and bioassays. HT-15 can selectively act on the NF-κB/AP1-mediated transrepression function of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and repress the expression of pro-inflammation cytokines (i.e., IL-1β, IL-6, COX-2, and CCL-2) as effectively as dexamethasone (Dex). Compared with Dex, HT-15 shows less transactivation potency that is associated with the main adverse effects of synthetic GCs, and no cross activities with other nuclear receptors. Furthermore, HT-15 exhibits very weak inhibition on the ratio of OPG/RANKL. Therefore, it may reduce the side effects induced by normal GCs. The bioactive compound HT-15 can serve as a starting point for the development of novel therapeutics for high dose or long-term anti-inflammatory treatment.",

However, accurate determination of matched molecular pair (MMP) transformations largely depend on the size and quality of existing experimental data. Lack of high-quality experimental data heavily hampers the extraction of more effective medicinal chemistry knowledge. Here, we developed a new strategy called quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)-assisted-MMPA to expand the number of chemical transformations and took the logD7.4 property endpoint as an example to demonstrate the reliability of the new method. A reliable logD7.4 consensus prediction model was firstly established, and its applicability domain was strictly assessed. By applying the reliable logD7.4 prediction model to screen two chemical databases, we obtained more high-quality logD7.4 data by defining a strict applicability domain threshold. Then, MMPA was performed on the predicted data and experimental data to derive more chemical rules. To validate the reliability of the chemical rules, we compared the magnitude and directionality of the property changes of the predicted rules with those of the measured rules. Then, we compared the novel chemical rules generated by our proposed approach with the published chemical rules, and found that the magnitude and directionality of the property changes were consistent, indicating that the proposed QSAR-assisted-MMPA approach has the potential to enrich the collection of rule types or even identify completely novel rules. Finally, we found that the number of the MMP rules derived from the experimental data could be amplified by the predicted data, which is helpful for us to analyze the medicinal chemical rules in local chemical environment. In summary, the proposed QSAR-assisted-MMPA approach could be regarded as a very promising strategy to expand the chemical transformation space for lead optimization, especially when no enough experimental data can support MMPA.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most deadly diseases all around the world. HBV infection is a causative factor of HCC and closely associated with HCC development. Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) is a key enzyme for cellular DNA synthesis and RR small subunit M2 (RRM2) is highly upregulated in HCC with poor survival rates. We have previously shown that HBV can activate the expression of RRM2 and the activity of RR enzyme for the viral DNA replication in host liver cells. Thus, RRM2 may be an important therapeutic target for HCC and HBV-related HCC. Pterostilbene, a natural plant component, potently inhibited in vitro RR enzyme activity with the IC50 of about 0.62 μM through interacting with RRM2 protein, which was much higher than current RRM2 inhibitory drugs. Pterostilbine inhibited cell proliferation with an MTT IC50 of about 20-40 μM in various HCC cell lines, causing DNA synthesis inhibition, cell cycle arrest at S phase, and accordingly apoptosis. On the other hand, the compound significantly inhibited HBV DNA replication in HBV genome integrated and newly transfected HCC cells, and the EC50 for inhibiting HBV replication was significantly lower than the IC50 for inhibiting HCC proliferation. Notably, pterostilbene possessed a similar inhibitory activity in sorafenib and lamivudine resistant HCC cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of pterostilbine against HCC proliferation and HBV replication were significantly reversed by addition of dNTP precursors, suggesting that RR was the intracellular target of the compound. Finally, pterostilbine effectively inhibited HCC xenograft growth with a relatively low toxicity in nude mouse experiments. This study demonstrates that pterostilbene is a novel potent RR inhibitor by targeting RRM2. It can simultaneously inhibit HCC proliferation and HBV replication with a potential new use for treatment of HCC and HBV-related HCC.",

The band gap of the WS2/GO heterostructures can be efficiently tuned in a wide range from 0.13 eV to 1.91 eV by changing the oxygen functionalities and the concentration. The spatial separation of the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum is observed, which are distributed in different layers. In addition, the work function of WS2 can also be modulated by GO in the range of 4.09 eV to 6.34 eV, which potentially increases the carrier concentration and broadens the applications of WS2 and other transition metal dichalcogenide materials in optoelectronic devices.",

This dilemma makes optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) an essential tool for automatically mining knowledge from an enormous amount of literature. However, existing OCSR methods fall far short of our expectations for realistic requirements due to their poor recovery accuracy. In this paper, we developed a deep neural network model named ABC-Net (Atom and Bond Center Network) to predict graph structures directly. Based on the divide-and-conquer principle, we propose to model an atom or a bond as a single point in the center. In this way, we can leverage a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate a series of heat-maps to identify these points and predict relevant properties, such as atom types, atom charges, bond types and other properties. Thus, the molecular structure can be recovered by assembling the detected atoms and bonds. Our approach integrates all the detection and property prediction tasks into a single fully CNN, which is scalable and capable of processing molecular images quite efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our method could achieve a significant improvement in recognition performance compared with publicly available tools. The proposed method could be considered as a promising solution to OCSR problems and a starting point for the acquisition of molecular information in the literature.",

A major challenge for the clinically used AR antagonists is the rapid emergence of resistance induced by the mutations at AR ligand binding domain (LBD), and therefore the discovery of novel anti-AR therapeutics that can combat mutation-induced resistance is quite demanding. Therein, blocking the interaction between AR and DNA represents an innovative strategy. However, the hits confirmed targeting on it so far are all structurally based on a sole chemical scaffold. In this study, an integrated docking-based virtual screening (VS) strategy based on the crystal structure of the DNA binding domain (DBD) of AR was conducted to search for novel AR antagonists with new scaffolds and 2-(2-butyl-1,3-dioxoisoindoline-5-carboxamido)-4,5-dimethoxybenzoicacid (Cpd39) was identified as a potential hit, which was competent to block the binding of AR DBD to DNA and showed decent potency against AR transcriptional activity. Furthermore, Cpd39 was safe and capable of effectively inhibiting the proliferation of PCa cell lines (i.e., LNCaP, PC3, DU145, and 22RV1) and reducing the expression of the genes regulated by not only the full-length AR but also the splice variant AR-V7.

Despite having been activated through phosphorylation and provided with ATP ligands, several near-atomistic cryo-EM structures of CFTR are in a closed state, as inferred from the lack of a continuous passage through a hydrophobic bottleneck region located in the extracellular portion of the pore. Here, we present repeated, microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations of human CFTR solvated in a lipid bilayer and aqueous NaCl. At equilibrium, Cl- ions enter the channel through a lateral intracellular portal and bind to two distinct cationic sites inside the channel pore but do not traverse the narrow, de-wetted bottleneck. Simulations conducted in the presence of a strong hyperpolarizing electric field led to spontaneous Cl- translocation events through the bottleneck region of the channel, suggesting that the protein relaxed to a functionally open state. Conformational changes of small magnitude involving transmembrane helices 1 and 6 preceded ion permeation through diverging exit routes at the extracellular end of the pore. The pore bottleneck undergoes wetting prior to Cl- translocation, suggesting that it acts as a hydrophobic gate. Although permeating Cl- ions remain mostly hydrated, partial dehydration occurs at the binding sites and in the bottleneck. The observed Cl- pathway is largely consistent with the loci of mutations that alter channel conductance, anion binding, and ion selectivity, supporting the model of the open state of CFTR obtained in the present study.",

Understanding NA-ligand interactions at the atomic scale is essential for investigating the molecular mechanism and further assisting in NA-targeted drug discovery. Molecular docking is one of the predominant computational approaches for predicting the interactions between NAs and small molecules. Despite the availability of versatile docking programs, their performance profiles for NA-ligand complexes have not been thoroughly characterized. In this study, we first compiled the largest structure-based NA-ligand binding data set to date, containing 800 noncovalent NA-ligand complexes with clearly identified ligands. Based on this extensive data set, eight frequently used docking programs, including six protein-ligand docking programs (LeDock, Surflex-Dock, UCSF Dock6, AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, and PLANTS) and two specific NA-ligand docking programs (rDock and RLDOCK), were systematically evaluated in terms of binding pose and binding affinity predictions. The results demonstrated that some protein-ligand docking programs, specifically PLANTS and LeDock, produced more promising or comparable results compared with the specialized NA-ligand docking programs. Among the programs evaluated, PLANTS, rDock, and LeDock showed the highest performance in binding pose prediction, and their top-1 and best root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) success rates were as follows: PLANTS (35.93 and 76.05%), rDock (27.25 and 72.16%), and LeDock (27.40 and 64.37%). Compared with the moderate level of binding pose prediction, few programs were successful in binding affinity prediction, and the best correlation (Rp = -0.461) was observed with PLANTS. Finally, further comparison with the latest NA-ligand docking program (NLDock) on four well-established data sets revealed that PLANTS and LeDock outperformed NLDock in terms of binding pose prediction on all data sets, demonstrating their significant potential for NA-ligand docking. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive evaluation of popular molecular docking programs for NA-ligand systems.",

Besides interrupting the PPIs with PPI inhibitors/blockers, increasing evidence shows that stabilizing the interaction between two interacting proteins may also benefit the therapy, such as the development of various types of molecular glues/stabilizers that mostly work by stabilizing the two interacting proteins to regulate the downstream biological effects. However, characterizing the stabilization effect of a stabilizer is usually hard or too complicated for traditional experiments since it involves ternary interactions [protein-protein-stabilizer (PPS) interaction]. Thus, developing reliable computational strategies will facilitate the discovery/design of molecular glues or PPI stabilizers. Here, by fully analyzing the energetic features of the binary interactions in the PPS ternary complex, we systematically investigated the performance of molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) methods on characterizing the stabilization effects of stabilizers in 14-3-3 systems. The results show that both MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA are powerful tools in distinguishing the stabilizers from the decoys (with area under the curves of 0.90-0.93 for all tested cases) and are reasonable for ranking protein-peptide interactions in the presence or absence of stabilizers as well (with the average Pearson correlation coefficient of ~0.6 at a relatively high dielectric constant for both methods). Moreover, to give a detailed picture of the stabilization effects, the stabilization mechanism is also analyzed from the structural and energetic points of view for individual systems containing strong or weak stabilizers. This study demonstrates a potential strategy to accelerate the discovery of PPI stabilizers.",

The free-energy landscape was characterized to elucidate the binding mechanism of S-pro to ACE2 with and without HS fragment DP4. We found that the stability of the T470-F490 loop and the hydrophobic interactions contributed from F486/Y489 in the T470-F490 loop of S-pro are quite crucial for the binding, which is enhanced by the presence of DP4. Our study provides valuable insights for rational drug design to prevent the invasion of SARS-CoV-2.",

        "abstract": "Acriflavine (ACF), a known antibacterial drug, has recently been recognized as a suitable candidate for cancer chemotherapy. However, the molecular target of ACF is not fully understood, which limits its application in cancer therapy. In this study, we established a structure-specific probe-based pull-down approach to comprehensively profile the potential target of ACF, and we identified DNA dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) as the direct target of ACF. Since DNA-PKcs facilitates the repair process following DNA double-strand breaks, we further developed a drug combination strategy that combined ACF with the bifunctional alkylating agent melphalan, which exerted a p53-dependent synergistic efficacy against human cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. With these findings, our study demonstrated that structure-specific probe-based pull-down approaches can be used to identify new functional target of drug, and provided novel opportunities for the development of ACF-based antitumor chemotherapies.",

This BHJ forms during the drying of the wet-deposited solution, because of physical processes such as crystallization and/or liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, the process-structure relationship remains insufficiently understood. In this work, a recently developed, coupled phase-field-fluid mechanics framework is used to simulate the BHJ formation upon drying. For the first time, this allows to investigate the interplay between all the relevant physical processes (evaporation, crystal nucleation and growth, liquid demixing, composition-dependent kinetic properties), within a single coherent theoretical framework. Simulations for the model system P3HT-PCBM are presented. The comparison with previously reported in situ characterization of the drying structure is very convincing: The morphology formation pathways, crystallization kinetics, and final morphology are in line with experimental results. The final BHJ morphology is a subtle mixture of pure crystalline donor and acceptor phases, pure and mixed amorphous domains, which depends on the process parameters and material properties. The expected benefit of such an approach is to identify physical design rules for ink formulation and processing conditions to optimize the cell's performance. It could be applied to recent organic material systems in the future.",

In practice, multiple conflicting objectives and costly evaluations (e.g., wet-lab experiments) make the diversity of candidates paramount. Computational methods have achieved initial success but still struggle with considering diversity in both objective and search space. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) algorithm leveraging the hypernetwork-based GFlowNets (HN-GFN) as an acquisition function optimizer, with the purpose of sampling a diverse batch of candidate molecular graphs from an approximate Pareto front. Using a single preference-conditioned hypernetwork, HN-GFN learns to explore various trade-offs between objectives. We further propose a hindsight-like off-policy strategy to share high-performing molecules among different preferences in order to speed up learning for HN-GFN. We empirically illustrate that HN-GFN has adequate capacity to generalize over preferences. Moreover, experiments in various real-world MOBO settings demonstrate that our framework predominantly outperforms existing methods in terms of candidate quality and sample efficiency.

In this study, we introduce a more elegant transformer-based framework with focused attention for molecular representation (TransFoxMol) to improve the understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) of molecular structure property relationships. TransFoxMol incorporates a multi-scale 2D molecular environment into a graph neural network + Transformer module and uses prior chemical maps to obtain a more focused attention landscape compared to that obtained using existing approaches. Experimental results show that TransFoxMol achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet benchmarks and surpasses the performance of baselines that use self-supervised learning or geometry-enhanced strategies on small-scale datasets. Subsequent analyses indicate that TransFoxMol's predictions are highly interpretable and the clever use of chemical knowledge enables AI to perceive molecules in a simple but rational way, enhancing performance.",

Ischemia-evoked neuroinflammation is implicated in the progressive brain injury after cerebral ischemia, while Caspase-1, an active component of inflammasome, exaggerates ischemic brain injury. Current Caspase-1 inhibitors are inadequate in safety and druggability. Here, we investigated the efficacy of CZL80, a novel Caspase-1 inhibitor, in mice with PIS. Mice and Caspase-1-/- mice were subjected to photothrombotic (PT)-induced cerebral ischemia. CZL80 (10, 30 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.p.) was administered for one week after PT onset. The transient and the progressive neurological dysfunction (as foot faults in the grid-walking task and forelimb symmetry in the cylinder task) was assessed on Day1 and Day4-7, respectively, after PT onset. Treatment with CZL80 (30 mg/kg) during Day1-7 significantly reduced the progressive, but not the transient neurological dysfunction. Furthermore, we showed that CZL80 administered on Day4-7, when the progressive neurological dysfunction occurred, produced significant beneficial effects against PIS, suggesting an extended therapeutic time-window. CZL80 administration could improve the neurological function even as late as Day43 after PT. In Caspase-1-/- mice with PIS, the beneficial effects of CZL80 were abolished. We found that Caspase-1 was upregulated during Day4-7 after PT and predominantly located in activated microglia, which was coincided with the progressive neurological deficits, and attenuated by CZL80. We showed that CZL80 administration did not reduce the infarct volume, but significantly suppressed microglia activation in the peri-infarct cortex, suggesting the involvement of microglial inflammasome in the pathology of PIS. Taken together, this study demonstrates that Caspase-1 is required for the progressive neurological dysfunction in PIS. CZL80 is a promising drug to promote the neurological recovery in PIS by inhibiting Caspase-1 within a long therapeutic time-window.",

Our aim is to generate molecules with low toxicity, good drug-like properties, and structural diversity. For multiobjective optimization, we have developed a method with hierarchical constraints on the toxicity space of small molecules to generate drug-like small molecules, which can also minimize the effect on the diversity of generated results. The evaluation results of the metrics indicate that the developed model has good effectiveness, novelty, and diversity. The generated molecules by this model are mainly distributed in low-toxicity regions, which suggests that our model can efficiently constrain the generation of toxic structures. In contrast to simply filtering toxic ones after generation, the low-toxicity molecular generative model can generate molecules with structural diversity. Our strategy can be used in target-based drug discovery to improve the quality of generated molecules with low-toxicity, drug-like, and highly active properties.",

These two kernels yield very similar results. Each kernel has its own advantages depending on the protein size. K1 performs better than K2 when the size is small and vice versa.

In log D7.4 prediction, graph neural networks (GNNs) can uncover subtle structure-property relationships (SPRs) by automatically extracting features from molecular graphs that facilitate the learning of SPRs, but their performances are often limited by the small size of available datasets. Herein, we present a transfer learning strategy called pretraining on computational data and then fine-tuning on experimental data (PCFE) to fully exploit the predictive potential of GNNs. PCFE works by pretraining a GNN model on 1.71 million computational log D data (low-fidelity data) and then fine-tuning it on 19,155 experimental log D7.4 data (high-fidelity data). The experiments for three GNN architectures (graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), and Attentive FP) demonstrated the effectiveness of PCFE in improving GNNs for log D7.4 predictions. Moreover, the optimal PCFE-trained GNN model (cx-Attentive FP, Rtest2 = 0.909) outperformed four excellent descriptor-based models (random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)). The robustness of the cx-Attentive FP model was also confirmed by evaluating the models with different training data sizes and dataset splitting strategies. Therefore, we developed a webserver and defined the applicability domain for this model. The webserver (http://tools.scbdd.com/chemlogd/) provides free log D7.4 prediction services. In addition, the important descriptors for log D7.4 were detected by the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method, and the most relevant substructures of log D7.4 were identified by the attention mechanism. Finally, the matched molecular pair analysis (MMPA) was performed to summarize the contributions of common chemical substituents to log D7.4, including a variety of hydrocarbon groups, halogen groups, heteroatoms, and polar groups. In conclusion, we believe that the cx-Attentive FP model can serve as a reliable tool to predict log D7.4 and hope that pretraining on low-fidelity data can help GNNs make accurate predictions of other endpoints in drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents AutoTemplate, an innovative data preprocessing protocol, addressing the crucial need for high-quality chemical reaction datasets in the realm of machine learning applications in organic chemistry. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have expanded the application of machine learning in chemistry, particularly in yield prediction, retrosynthesis, and reaction condition prediction. However, the effectiveness of these models hinges on the integrity of chemical reaction datasets, which are often plagued by inconsistencies like missing reactants, incorrect atom mappings, and outright erroneous reactions. AutoTemplate introduces a two-stage approach to refine these datasets. The first stage involves extracting meaningful reaction transformation rules and formulating generic reaction templates using a simplified SMARTS representation. This simplification broadens the applicability of templates across various chemical reactions. The second stage is template-guided reaction curation, where these templates are systematically applied to validate and correct the reaction data. This process effectively amends missing reactant information, rectifies atom-mapping errors, and eliminates incorrect data entries. A standout feature of AutoTemplate is its capability to concurrently identify and correct false chemical reactions. It operates on the premise that most reactions in datasets are accurate, using these as templates to guide the correction of flawed entries. The protocol demonstrates its efficacy across a range of chemical reactions, significantly enhancing dataset quality. This advancement provides a more robust foundation for developing reliable machine learning models in chemistry, thereby improving the accuracy of forward and retrosynthetic predictions. AutoTemplate marks a significant progression in the preprocessing of chemical reaction datasets, bridging a vital gap and facilitating more precise and efficient machine learning applications in organic synthesis. SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: The proposed automated preprocessing tool for chemical reaction data aims to identify errors within chemical databases. Specifically, if the errors involve atom mapping or the absence of reactant types, corrections can be systematically applied using reaction templates, ultimately elevating the overall quality of the database.",

Binding of agonists or antagonists to the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) of NRs can regulate the downstream signaling pathways with different physiological effects. However, it is still hard to determine the molecular type of a LBP-bound ligand because both the agonists and antagonists bind to the same position of the protein. Therefore, it is necessary to develop precise and efficient methods to facilitate the discrimination of agonists and antagonists targeting the LBP of NRs. Here, combining structural and energetic analyses with machine-learning (ML) algorithms, we constructed a series of structure-based ML models to determine the molecular category of the LBP-bound ligands. We show that the proposed models work robustly and with high accuracy (ACC > 0.9) for determining the category of molecules derived from docking-based and crystallized poses. Furthermore, the models are also capable of determining the molecular category of ligands with dual opposite functions on different NRs (i.e., working as an agonist in one NR target, whereas functioning as an antagonist in another) with reasonable accuracy. The proposed method is expected to facilitate the determination of the molecular properties of ligands targeting the LBP of NRs with structural interpretation.",

However, most G4 stabilizers lack selectivity over various G4s in the genomes. By investigating the binding characteristics of a conjugated imidazole/carbazole (IZCZ-3) molecule with the G4s of c-MYC, c-KIT, and telomere through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, the present study demonstrates that though the binding affinities between IZCZ-3 and the monomeric G4s are inconsistent with the experimental data, the dimeric c-MYC and c-KIT G4s can be targeted by IZCZ-3 through forming concomitant π-π stacking interactions with the intermolecular assembly producing significant contributions to the binding affinity. In the intermolecular dimeric G4-IZCZ-3 binding complexes, IZCZ-3 prefers the c-MYC G4 that has two exposed G-tetrads per monomer over the single G-tetrad-exposed c-KIT G4 by creating more aggregation effects. Taking the aggregation effects into account, the binding affinity order of IZCZ-3 follows c-MYC G4 > c-KIT G4 > telomeric G4, agreeing well with the experimental observation. Thus, the selectivity of IZCZ-3 for c-MYC G4 probably comes from its role in stabilizing the sandwichlike intermolecular aggregates, providing a framework for the development of selective stabilizers targeting c-MYC G4.",

Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.",

        "abstract": "The expertise accumulated in deep neural network-based structure prediction has been widely transferred to the field of protein-ligand binding pose prediction, thus leading to the emergence of a variety of deep learning-guided docking models for predicting protein-ligand binding poses without relying on heavy sampling. However, their prediction accuracy and applicability are still far from satisfactory, partially due to the lack of protein-ligand binding complex data. To this end, we create a large-scale complex dataset containing ∼9 M protein-ligand docking complexes for pre-training, and propose CarsiDock, the first deep learning-guided docking approach that leverages pre-training of millions of predicted protein-ligand complexes. CarsiDock contains two main stages, i.e., a deep learning model for the prediction of protein-ligand atomic distance matrices, and a translation, rotation and torsion-guided geometry optimization procedure to reconstruct the matrices into a credible binding pose. The pre-training and multiple innovative architectural designs facilitate the dramatically improved docking accuracy of our approach over the baselines in terms of multiple docking scenarios, thereby contributing to its outstanding early recognition performance in several retrospective virtual screening campaigns. Further explorations demonstrate that CarsiDock can not only guarantee the topological reliability of the binding poses but also successfully reproduce the crucial interactions in crystalized structures, highlighting its superior applicability.",

Due to the high computational cost in the process of feature generation, the numbers of descriptors used in MLSFs and the characterization of protein-ligand interactions are always limited, which may affect the overall accuracy and efficiency. Here, we propose a new SF called TB-IECS (theory-based interaction energy component score), which combines energy terms from Smina and NNScore version 2, and utilizes the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm for model training. In this study, the energy terms decomposed from 15 traditional SFs were firstly categorized based on their formulas and physicochemical principles, and 324 feature combinations were generated accordingly. Five best feature combinations were selected for further evaluation of the model performance in regard to the selection of feature vectors with various length, interaction types and ML algorithms. The virtual screening power of TB-IECS was assessed on the datasets of DUD-E and LIT-PCBA, as well as seven target-specific datasets from the ChemDiv database. The results showed that TB-IECS outperformed classical SFs including Glide SP and Dock, and effectively balanced the efficiency and accuracy for practical virtual screening.",

        "abstract": "Accurate estimation of solvation free energy (SFE) lays the foundation for accurate prediction of binding free energy. The Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) or generalized Born (GB) combined with surface area (SA) continuum solvation method (PBSA and GBSA) have been widely used in SFE calculations because they can achieve good balance between accuracy and efficiency. However, the accuracy of these methods can be affected by several factors such as the charge models, polar and nonpolar SFE calculation methods and the atom radii used in the calculation. In this work, the performance of the ABCG2 (AM1-BCC-GAFF2) charge model as well as other two charge models, that is, RESP (Restrained Electrostatic Potential) and AM1-BCC (Austin Model 1-bond charge corrections), on the SFE prediction of 544 small molecules in water by PBSA/GBSA was evaluated. In order to improve the performance of the PBSA prediction based on the ABCG2 charge, we further explored the influence of atom radii on the prediction accuracy and yielded a set of atom radius parameters for more accurate SFE prediction using PBSA based on the ABCG2/GAFF2 by reproducing the thermodynamic integration (TI) calculation results. The PB radius parameters of carbon, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, chloride, bromide and iodine, were adjusted. New atom types, on, oi, hn1, hn2, hn3, were introduced to further improve the fitting performance. Then, we tuned the parameters in the nonpolar SFE model using the experimental SFE data and the PB calculation results. By adopting the new radius parameters and new nonpolar SFE model, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the SFE calculation for the 544 molecules decreased from 2.38 to 1.05 kcal/mol. Finally, the new radius parameters were applied in the prediction of protein-ligand binding free energies using the MM-PBSA method. For the eight systems tested, we could observe higher correlation between the experiment data and calculation results and smaller prediction errors for the absolute binding free energies, demonstrating that our new radius parameters can improve the free energy calculation using the MM-PBSA method.",

In recent years, various in-silico approaches have been proposed to expedite time- and resource-consuming experiments for target detection. Herein, we developed several chemogenomic models for target prediction based on multi-scale information of chemical structures and protein sequences. By combining the information of a compound with multiple protein targets together and putting these compound-target pairs into a well-established model, the scores to indicate whether there are interactions between compounds and targets can be derived, and thus a target prediction task can be completed by sorting the outputted scores. To improve the prediction performance, we constructed several chemogenomic models using multi-scale information of chemical structures and protein sequences, and the ensemble model with the best performance was used as our final model. The model was validated by various strategies and external datasets and the promising target prediction capability of the model, i.e., the fraction of known targets identified in the top-k (1 to 10) list of the potential target candidates suggested by the model, was confirmed. Compared with multiple state-of-art target prediction methods, our model showed equivalent or better predictive ability in terms of the top-k predictions.

        "abstract": "Lipophilicity (logD) and aqueous solubility (logSw) play a central role in drug development. The accurate prediction of these properties remains to be solved due to data scarcity. Current methodologies neglect the intrinsic relationships between physicochemical properties and usually ignore the ionization effects. Here, we propose an attention-driven mixture-of-experts (MoE) model named ALipSol, which explicitly reproduces the hierarchy of task relationships. We adopt the principle of divide-and-conquer by breaking down the complex end point (logD or logSw) into simpler ones (acidic pKa, basic pKa, and logP) and allocating a specific expert network for each subproblem. Subsequently, we implement transfer learning to extract knowledge from related tasks, thus alleviating the dilemma of limited data. Additionally, we substitute the gating network with an attention mechanism to better capture the dynamic task relationships on a per-example basis. We adopt local fine-tuning and consensus prediction to further boost model performance. Extensive evaluation experiments verify the success of the ALipSol model, which achieves RMSE improvement of 8.04%, 2.49%, 8.57%, 12.8%, and 8.60% on the Lipop, ESOL, AqSolDB, external logD, and external logS data sets, respectively, compared with Attentive FP and the state-of-the-art in silico tools. In particular, our model yields more significant advantages (Welch's t-test) for small training data, implying its high robustness and generalizability. The interpretability analysis proves that the atom contributions learned by ALipSol are more reasonable compared with the vanilla Attentive FP, and the substitution effects in benzene derivatives agreed well with empirical constants, revealing the potential of our model to extract useful patterns from data and provide guidance for lead optimization.",

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine that is involved in the pathophysiology of various inflammatory diseases by inducing various proinflammatory cytokines. Compound 3-({[4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-6-methyl-2-pyrimidinyl]thio}methyl)benzoic acid (Z-312) is a novel small -molecule inhibitor of MIF tautomeric activity. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of Z-312 on liposaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that Z-312 significantly decreased the production of nitric oxide (NO), interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated microglial cells. Mechanistically, nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, degradation and phosphorylation of IκBα, NF-κB transcriptional activity and phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and JNK were markedly attenuated by pretreatment with Z-312 in BV-2 microglial cells. In addition, Z-312 suppressed the neurotoxic effects of cell culture medium of LPS-activated BV-2 microglia on cocultured mouse HT22 neuroblastoma cells. An in vivo study demonstrated that Z-312 markedly ameliorated microglial activation and subsequent DA neuron loss in an LPS-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model. These results suggest that MIF inhibitor Z-312 may be a promising neuroprotective agent for the treatment of neuroinflammation-mediated neurological diseases.",

        "abstract": "By means of estimators based on non-equilibrium work, equilibrium free energy differences or potentials of mean force (PMFs) of a system of interest can be computed from biased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The approach, however, is often plagued by slow conformational sampling and poor convergence, especially when the solvent effects are taken into account. Here, as a possible way to alleviate the problem, several widely used implicit-solvent models, which are derived from the analytic generalized Born (GB) equation and implemented in the AMBER suite of programs, were employed in free energy calculations based on non-equilibrium work and evaluated for their abilities to emulate explicit water. As a test case, pulling MD simulations were carried out on an alanine polypeptide with different solvent models and protocols, followed by comparisons of the reconstructed PMF profiles along the unfolding coordinate. The results show that when employing the non-equilibrium work method, sampling with an implicit-solvent model is several times faster and, more importantly, converges more rapidly than that with explicit water due to reduction of dissipation. Among the assessed GB models, the Neck variants outperform the OBC and HCT variants in terms of accuracy, whereas their computational costs are comparable. In addition, for the best-performing models, the impact of the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) dependent nonpolar solvation term was also examined. The present study highlights the advantages of implicit-solvent models for non-equilibrium sampling.",

However, most DL-assisted synthesis planning methods offer either none or very limited capability to recommend suitable reaction conditions (RCs) for their reaction predictions. Currently, the prediction of RCs with a DL framework is hindered by several factors, including: (a) lack of a standardized dataset for benchmarking, (b) lack of a general prediction model with powerful representation, and (c) lack of interpretability. To address these issues, we first created 2 standardized RC datasets covering a broad range of reaction classes and then proposed a powerful and interpretable Transformer-based RC predictor named Parrot. Through careful design of the model architecture, pretraining method, and training strategy, Parrot improved the overall top-3 prediction accuracy on catalysis, solvents, and other reagents by as much as 13.44%, compared to the best previous model on a newly curated dataset. Additionally, the mean absolute error of the predicted temperatures was reduced by about 4 °C. Furthermore, Parrot manifests strong generalization capacity with superior cross-chemical-space prediction accuracy. Attention analysis indicates that Parrot effectively captures crucial chemical information and exhibits a high level of interpretability in the prediction of RCs. The proposed model Parrot exemplifies how modern neural network architecture when appropriately pretrained can be versatile in making reliable, generalizable, and interpretable recommendation for RCs even when the underlying training dataset may still be limited in diversity.",

GR TA is involved in many adverse effects of GR-targeting drugs, and therefore, the discovery of novel GR ligands with lower TA activity and longer residence time is quite urgent. Undoubtedly, understanding the ligand dissociation mechanisms and the structural basis of the TA regulation is crucial for the development of novel GR-targeting drugs. Here, we used random accelerated molecular dynamics (RAMD) and funnel metadynamics (FM) simulations to explore the dissociation mechanisms of 5 classic glucocorticoids and 6 nonsteroidal GR ligands. Multiple ligand dissociation pathways were discovered. The classic glucocorticoids exhibit a strong preference for Path I, and most nonsteroidal ligands tend to dissociate along mixed pathways. We also find that the distinct unbinding preferences for AZD2906 and AZD9567, two representative nonsteroidal ligands with similar scaffolds but different TA activities, are primarily determined by their different polar interactions with the surrounding residues. Notably, the binding of AZD9567 poses a substantial impact on the conformation of the GR homodimer interface, which provides a valuable clue to understand the mechanisms of the TA-related side effects induced by the adjustments of the homodimerization process. These findings are critical for the structure-based rational design of novel GR ligands with more potent anti-inflammatory potency and reduced side effects.",

Traditional methods to derive Born radii are mostly based on a complicated formula, while our method is easier and more direct. Atoms are classified according to their atom type, and the Born radii of each type are obtained by fitting to experimental solvation free energy. The SMARTS language is used for the exact definition of atoms types, and Ullmann's subgraph isomorphism algorithm is used to deduce the environment. A generic algorithm is used for the parameter fitting because of its efficiency in searching a huge phase space, and its results are then optimized by using the conjugate gradient method. The final parameter set is fitting from a training set containing 357 molecules and is tested using a test set of 44 small organic molecules, and the average error is 0.58 kcal/mol for 36 neutral molecules and is 1.67 kcal/mol for 8 ions. The model is further tested under organic molecules, biopolymers, and a protein-inhibitor complex and yields reliable results in all these cases.

        "abstract": "The Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) and the Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) methods calculate binding free energies for macromolecules by combining molecular mechanics calculations and continuum solvation models. To systematically evaluate the performance of these methods, we report here an extensive study of 59 ligands interacting with six different proteins. First, we explored the effects of the length of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, ranging from 400 to 4800 ps, and the solute dielectric constant (1, 2, or 4) on the binding free energies predicted by MM/PBSA. The following three important conclusions could be observed: (1) MD simulation length has an obvious impact on the predictions, and longer MD simulation is not always necessary to achieve better predictions. (2) The predictions are quite sensitive to the solute dielectric constant, and this parameter should be carefully determined according to the characteristics of the protein/ligand binding interface. (3) Conformational entropy often show large fluctuations in MD trajectories, and a large number of snapshots are necessary to achieve stable predictions. Next, we evaluated the accuracy of the binding free energies calculated by three Generalized Born (GB) models. We found that the GB model developed by Onufriev and Case was the most successful model in ranking the binding affinities of the studied inhibitors. Finally, we evaluated the performance of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA in predicting binding free energies. Our results showed that MM/PBSA performed better in calculating absolute, but not necessarily relative, binding free energies than MM/GBSA. Considering its computational efficiency, MM/GBSA can serve as a powerful tool in drug design, where correct ranking of inhibitors is often emphasized.",

        "abstract": "A new method is proposed for calculating aqueous solvation free energy based on atom-weighted solvent accessible surface areas. The method, SAWSA v2.0, gives the aqueous solvation free energy by summing the contributions of component atoms and a correction factor. We applied two different sets of atom typing rules and fitting processes for small organic molecules and proteins, respectively. For small organic molecules, the model classified the atoms in organic molecules into 65 basic types and additionally. For small organic molecules we proposed a correction factor of \"hydrophobic carbon\" to account for the aggregation of hydrocarbons and compounds with long hydrophobic aliphatic chains. The contributions for each atom type and correction factor were derived by multivariate regression analysis of 379 neutral molecules and 39 ions with known experimental aqueous solvation free energies. Based on the new atom typing rules, the correlation coefficient (r) for fitting the whole neutral organic molecules is 0.984, and the absolute mean error is 0.40 kcal mol(-1), which is much better than those of the model proposed by Wang et al. and the SAWSA model previously proposed by us. Furthermore, the SAWSA v2.0 model was compared with the simple atom-additive model based on the number of atom types (NA). The calculated results show that for small organic molecules, the predictions from the SAWSA v2.0 model are slightly better than those from the atom-additive model based on NA. However, for macromolecules such as proteins, due to the connection between their molecular conformation and their molecular surface area, the atom-additive model based on the number of atom types has little predictive power. In order to investigate the predictive power of our model, a systematic comparison was performed on seven solvation models including SAWSA v2.0, GB/SA_1, GB/SA_2, PB/SA_1, PB/SA_2, AM1/SM5.2R and SM5.0R. The results showed that for organic molecules the SAWSA v2.0 model is better than the other six solvation models. For proteins, the model classified the atoms into 20 basic types and the predicted aqueous free energies of solvation by PB/SA were used for fitting. The solvation model based on the new parameters was employed to predict the solvation free energies of 38 proteins. The predicted values from our model were in good agreement with those from the PB/SA model and were much better than those given by the other four models developed for proteins.",

        "abstract": "Accurate and reliable calculation of protein-ligand binding free energy is of central importance in computational biophysics and structure-based drug design. Among the various methods to calculate protein-ligand binding affinities, alchemical free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations performed by way of explicitly solvated molecular dynamics simulations (FEP/MD) provide a thermodynamically rigorous and complete description of the binding event and should in turn yield highly accurate predictions. Although the original theory of FEP was proposed more than 60 years ago, subsequent applications of FEP to compute protein-ligand binding free energies in the context of drug discovery projects over much of that time period was sporadic and generally unsuccessful. This was mainly due to the limited accuracy of the available force fields, inadequate sampling of the protein-ligand conformational space, complexity of simulation set up and analysis, and the large computational resources required to pursue such calculations. Over the past few years, there have been advances in computing power, classical force field accuracy, enhanced sampling algorithms, and simulation setup. This has led to newer FEP implementations such as the FEP+ technology developed by Schrödinger Inc., which has enabled accurate and reliable calculations of protein-ligand binding free energies and positioned free energy calculations to play a guiding role in small-molecule drug discovery. In this chapter, we outline the methodological advances in FEP+, including the OPLS3 force fields, the REST2 (Replica Exchange with Solute Tempering) enhanced sampling, the incorporation of REST2 sampling with conventional FEP (Free Energy Perturbation) through FEP/REST, and the advanced simulation setup and data analysis. The validation of FEP+ method in retrospective studies and the prospective applications in drug discovery projects are also discussed. We then present the recent extension of FEP+ method to handle challenging perturbations, including core-hopping transformations, macrocycle modifications, and reversible covalent inhibitor optimization. The limitations and pitfalls of the current FEP+ methodology and the best practices in real applications are also examined.",

        "abstract": "Contemporary structure-based molecular generative methods have demonstrated their potential to model the geometric and energetic complementarity between ligands and receptors, thereby facilitating the design of molecules with favorable binding affinity and target specificity. Despite the introduction of deep generative models for molecular generation, the atom-wise generation paradigm that partially contradicts chemical intuition limits the validity and synthetic accessibility of the generated molecules. Additionally, the dependence of deep learning models on large-scale structural data has hindered their adaptability across different targets. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel search-based framework, 3D-MCTS, for structure-based de novo drug design. Distinct from prevailing atom-centric methods, 3D-MCTS employs a fragment-based molecular editing strategy. The fragments decomposed from small-molecule drugs are recombined under predefined retrosynthetic rules, offering improved drug-likeness and synthesizability, overcoming the inherent limitations of atom-based approaches. Leveraging multi-threaded parallel simulations combined with a real-time energy constraint-based pruning strategy, 3D-MCTS achieves remarkable efficiency. At a fixed computational cost, it outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by producing molecules with enhanced binding affinity. Furthermore, its fragment-based approach ensures the generation of more dependable binding conformations, exhibiting a success rate 43.6% higher than that of other SOTAs. This advantage becomes even more pronounced when handling targets that significantly deviate from the training dataset. 3D-MCTS is capable of achieving thirty times more hits with high binding affinity than traditional virtual screening methods, which demonstrates the superior ability of 3D-MCTS to explore chemical space. Moreover, the flexibility of our framework makes it easy to incorporate domain knowledge during the process, thereby enabling the generation of molecules with desirable pharmacophores and enhanced binding affinity. The adaptability of 3D-MCTS is further showcased in metalloprotein applications, highlighting its potential across various drug design scenarios.",

However, the information of negative data used to construct MLSFs was rarely reported in the literature, and meanwhile the putative inactive molecules recorded in existing databases usually have obvious bias from active molecules. Here we proposed an easy-to-use method named AMLSF that combines active learning using negative molecular selection strategies with MLSF, which can iteratively improve the quality of inactive sets and thus reduce the false positive rate of virtual screening. We chose energy auxiliary terms learning as the MLSF and validated our method on eight targets in the diverse subset of DUD-E. For each target, we screened the IterBioScreen database by AMLSF and compared the screening results with those of the four control models. The results illustrate that the number of active molecules in the top 1000 molecules identified by AMLSF was significantly higher than those identified by the control models. In addition, the free energy calculation results for the top 10 molecules screened out by the AMLSF, null model and control models based on DUD-E also proved that more active molecules can be identified, and the false positive rate can be reduced by AMLSF.",

Designing drugs targeting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) with high selectivity is challenging because of their highly conserved binding pockets. To reveal the underlying general selectivity mechanism, we carried out comprehensive analyses from both the thermodynamics and kinetics points of view on a representative CDK12 inhibitor. To fully capture the binding features of the drug-target recognition process, we proposed to use kinetic residue energy analysis (KREA) in conjunction with the community network analysis (CNA) to reveal the underlying cooperation effect between individual residues/protein motifs to the binding/dissociating process of the ligand. The general mechanism of drug selectivity in CDKs can be summarized as that the difference of structural cooperation between the ligand and the protein motifs leads to the difference of the energetic contribution of the key residues to the ligand. The proposed mechanisms may be prevalent in drug selectivity issues, and the insights may help design new strategies to overcome/attenuate the drug selectivity associated problems.",

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, VLCFAs are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through a four-step elongation cycle. However, the functions of VLCFA elongases in phytopathogenic fungi remain largely unexplored. Here, we identified a single copy of the VLCFA elongase gene FgELO2 in Fusarium graminearum that causes Fusarium head blight worldwide. FgElo2 localized to ER membrane, and deletion mutant of FgELO2 exhibited serious defects in vegetative growth and conidiation. Importantly, ΔFgElo2 led to ergosterol content reduction and disrupted the ER-localization of 14-α-demethylase FgCyp51s, indicating that the scarce of SLs reduced ergosterol, which ultimately elevated the sensitivity of ΔFgElo2 to tebuconazole. Fluorescent microscopic examination suggested that FgElo2 was degraded upon cell membrane stress. ΔFgElo2 showed decreased phosphorylation of high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway and subsequently exhibited remarkable sensitivity to osmotic stress. In addition, fungal virulence was dramatically reduced in ΔFgElo2 via inhibiting deoxynivalenol production and formation of infection structures. Together, this study demonstrates that the VLCFA elongase FgElo2 modulates fungal development, tebuconazole sensitivity, stress responses and virulence, which may advance our understanding of pathogen-host interactions mediated by VLCFAs.",

This system was further applied for high-throughput screening of HDAC1 inhibitors over a natural compound library containing 147 compounds, resulting in the identification of a novel HDAC1 down-regulator (Ginsenoside RK3). Our results demonstrated the sensitivity and robustness of the assay system towards HDAC1. It should serve as a valuable tool for biochemical studies and drug screening.",

        "abstract": "Small-molecule conformer generation (SMCG) is an extremely important task in both ligand- and structure-based computer-aided drug design, especially during the hit discovery phase. Recently, a multitude of artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored for SMCG have emerged. Despite developers typically furnishing performance evaluation data upon releasing their AI models, a comprehensive and equitable performance comparison between AI models and conventional methods is still lacking. In this study, we curated a new benchmarking data set comprising 3354 high-quality ligand bioactive conformations. Subsequently, we conducted a systematic assessment of the performance of four widely adopted traditional methods (i.e., ConfGenX, Conformator, OMEGA, and RDKit ETKDG) and five AI models (i.e., ConfGF, DMCG, GeoDiff, GeoMol, and torsional diffusion) in the tasks of reproducing bioactive and low-energy conformations of small molecules. In the former task, the AI models have no advantage, particularly with a maximum ensemble size of 1. Even the best-performing AI model GeoMol is still worse than any of the tested traditional methods. Conversely, in the latter task, the torsional diffusion model shows obvious advantages, surpassing the best-performing traditional method ConfGenX by 26.09 and 12.97% on the COV-R and COV-P metrics, respectively. Furthermore, the influence of force field-based fine-tuning on the quality of the generated conformers was also discussed. Finally, a user-friendly Web server called fastSMCG was developed to enable researchers to rapidly and flexibly generate small-molecule conformers using both traditional and AI methods. We anticipate that our work will offer valuable practical assistance to the scientific community in this field.",

When AR signaling pathway is blocked by AR-targeted therapy, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) could compensate for AR function especially at the late stage of PCa. AR-GR dual antagonist is expected to be a good solution for this situation. Nevertheless, no effective non-steroidal AR-GR dual antagonist has been reported so far. In this study, an AR-GR dual binder H18 was first discovered by combining structure-based virtual screening and biological evaluation. Then with the aid of computationally guided design, the AR-GR dual antagonist HD57 was finally identified with antagonistic activity towards both AR (IC50 = 0.394 μM) and GR (IC50 = 17.81 μM). Moreover, HD57 could effectively antagonize various clinically relevant AR mutants. Further molecular dynamics simulation provided more atomic insights into the mode of action of HD57. Our research presents an efficient and rational strategy for discovering novel AR-GR dual antagonists, and the new scaffold provides important clues for the development of novel therapeutics for castration-resistant PCa.",

Here, to obtain compounds both with novelty and high activity to a target, we proposed a conditional molecular generation model COMG by considering the docking score and 3D pharmacophore matching during molecular generation. The proposed model was based on the conditional variational autoencoder architecture constrained by the pharmacophore matching score. During Bayesian optimization, the docking score was applied to enhance the target relevance of generated compounds. Furthermore, to overcome the problem of high structural similarity caused by Bayesian optimization, the idea of the scaffold memory unit was also introduced. The evaluation results of COMG show that our model not only can improve the structural diversity of generated molecules but also can effectively improve the proportion of target-related drug-active molecules.

Despite the appealing potential, constructing a robust ML-PES is still challenging since the training set of the PES should cover a broad enough configuration space. In this work, we demonstrate that when the concerned properties could be collected by the localized sampling of the configuration space, quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations can be invoked to efficiently obtain locally accurate ML-PESs. We prove our concept with two model reactions: methyl migration of i-pentane cation and dimerization of cyclopentadiene.

A number of DNMT3A inhibitors have been reported, but most of them do not have good potency, high selectivity and/or low cytotoxicity. It has been suggested that a non-conserved region around the target recognition domain (TRD) loop is implicated in the DNMT3A activity under the allosteric regulation of the ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L (ADD) domain, but the molecular mechanism of the regulation of the TRD loop on the DNMT3A activity needs to be elucidated. In this study, based on the reported crystal structures, the dynamics of the TRD loop in different multimerization with/without the bound guest molecule, namely the ADD domain or the DNA molecule, was investigated using conventional molecular dynamics (MD) and umbrella sampling simulations. The simulation results illustrate that the TRD loop exhibits relatively higher flexibility than the other components in the whole catalytic domain (CD), which could be well stabilized into different local minima through the binding with either the ADD domain or the DNA molecule by forming tight hydrogen-bond and salt-bridge networks involving distinct residues. Moreover, the movement of the TRD loop away from the catalytic loop upon activation could be triggered simply by the detachment of the ADD domain, but not necessarily induced by the ADD domain relocation on the CD. All these dynamic structural details could be a supplement to the previously reported crystal structure, which underlines the importance of the structural flexibility for the critical residues in the TRD loop, arousing more interest in the rational design of novel DNMT3A inhibitors targeting this region.",

Nucleosides require a specialized class of integral membrane proteins, known as nucleoside transporters (NTs), for specific transport across cell membranes. NTs are also important determinants for the transport of nucleoside-derived drugs across cell membranes. Recently, the crystal structure of the vcCNT (Vibrio cholerae Concentrative Nucleoside Transporter) was reported. Here we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the vcCNT structure in the presence of various sodium gradients, since CNTs are sodium-coupled transporters. The results highlight the important role of sodium bound to the vcCNT in the transport of uridine. Our MD simulations show that, without NaCl, uridine remains stable in the binding pocket of the vcCNT. In the presence of 20 mM NaCl, uridine moves from the binding pocket and approaches the entrance of the intracellular side. In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, uridine passes through most part of the entrance and approaches the intracellular side. The polar/charged amino acids in the binding pocket are important in the transport process. They first \"fix\" the ribose and allow the uracil base of uridine to approach the entrance of the intracellular side, and then \"release\" the ribose to allow uridine to move freely into the intracellular side coupled with the movement of sodium ions and HP1b. Finally, we propose a detailed mechanism of the nucleoside transport from the binding pocket to the intracellular side of the vcCNT.",

These methods, while effective in designing tightly bound ligands, often overlook other essential properties such as synthesizability. The fragment-wise generation paradigm offers a promising solution. However, a common challenge across both atom-wise and fragment-wise methods lies in their limited ability to co-design plausible chemical and geometrical structures, resulting in distorted conformations. In response to this challenge, we introduce the Deep Geometry Handling protocol, a more abstract design that extends the design focus beyond the model architecture. Through a comprehensive review of existing geometry-related models and their protocols, we propose a novel hybrid strategy, culminating in the development of FragGen - a geometry-reliable, fragment-wise molecular generation method. FragGen marks a significant leap forward in the quality of generated geometry and the synthesis accessibility of molecules. The efficacy of FragGen is further validated by its successful application in designing type II kinase inhibitors at the nanomolar level.",

A large number of PROTACs have been reported, but due to the complicated structural and kinetic characteristics of the target-PROTAC-E3 ligase ternary interaction process, the rational design of PROTACs is still quite challenging. Here, we characterized and analyzed the kinetic mechanism of MZ1, a PROTAC that targets the bromodomain (BD) of the bromodomain and extra terminal (BET) protein (Brd2, Brd3, or Brd4) and von Hippel-Lindau E3 ligase (VHL), from the kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives of view by using enhanced sampling simulations and free energy calculations. The simulations yielded satisfactory predictions on the relative residence time and standard binding free energy (rp > 0.9) for MZ1 in different BrdBD-MZ1-VHL ternary complexes. Interestingly, the simulation of the PROTAC ternary complex disintegration illustrates that MZ1 tends to remain on the surface of VHL with the BD proteins dissociating alone without a specific dissociation direction, indicating that the PROTAC prefers more to bind with E3 ligase at the first step in the formation of the target-PROTAC-E3 ligase ternary complex. Further exploration of the degradation difference of MZ1 in different Brd systems shows that the PROTAC with higher degradation efficiency tends to leave more lysine exposed on the target protein, which is guaranteed by the stability (binding affinity) and durability (residence time) of the target-PROTAC-E3 ligase ternary complex. It is quite possible that the underlying binding characteristics of the BrdBD-MZ1-VHL systems revealed by this study may be shared by different PROTAC systems as a general rule, which may accelerate rational PROTAC design with higher degradation efficiency.",

Significant progress has been made by resorting to generative models for graphs. However, limited attention is paid to hierarchical generative models, which can exploit the inherent hierarchical structure (with rich semantic information) of the molecular graphs and generate complex molecules of larger size that we shall demonstrate to be difficult for most existing models. The primary challenge to hierarchical generation is the non-differentiable issue caused by the generation of intermediate discrete coarsened graph structures. To sidestep this issue, we cast the tricky hierarchical generation problem over discrete spaces as the reverse process of hierarchical representation learning and propose MolHF, a new hierarchical flow-based model that generates molecular graphs in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, MolHF first generates bonds through a multi-scale architecture, then generates atoms based on the coarsened graph structure at each scale. We demonstrate that MolHF achieves state-of-the-art performance in random generation and property optimization, implying its high capacity to model data distribution. Furthermore, MolHF is the first flow-based model that can be applied to model larger molecules (polymer) with more than 100 heavy atoms.

One of the reasons for the resistance is the internalization and recycling of PD-L1 itself upon antibody binding. The inhibition of lysosome-mediated degradation of PD-L1 is critical for preserving the amount of PD-L1 recycling back to the cell membrane. In this study, we find that Hsc70 promotes PD-L1 degradation through the endosome-lysosome pathway and reduces PD-L1 recycling to the cell membrane. This effect is dependent on Hsc70-PD-L1 binding which inhibits the CMTM6-PD-L1 interaction. We further identify an Hsp90α/β inhibitor, AUY-922, which induces Hsc70 expression and PD-L1 lysosomal degradation. Either Hsc70 overexpression or AUY-922 treatment can reduce PD-L1 expression, inhibit tumor growth and promote anti-tumor immunity in female mice; AUY-922 can further enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA4 treatment.

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most prevalent malignancy among men worldwide. The aberrant activation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling has been recognized as a crucial oncogenic driver for PCa and AR antagonists are widely used in PCa therapy. To develop novel AR antagonist, a machine-learning MIEC-SVM model was established for the virtual screening and 51 candidates were selected and submitted for bioactivity evaluation. To our surprise, a new-scaffold AR antagonist C2 with comparable bioactivity with Enz was identified at the initial round of screening. C2 showed pronounced inhibition on the transcriptional function (IC50 = 0.63 μM) and nuclear translocation of AR and significant antiproliferative and antimetastatic activity on PCa cell line of LNCaP. In addition, C2 exhibited a stronger ability to block the cell cycle of LNCaP than Enz at lower dose and superior AR specificity. Our study highlights the success of MIEC-SVM in discovering AR antagonists, and compound C2 presents a promising new scaffold for the development of AR-targeted therapeutics.",

        "title": "Advancing Ligand Docking through Deep Learning: Challenges and Prospects in Virtual Screening",
        "abstract": "Molecular docking, also termed ligand docking (LD), is a pivotal element of structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) used to predict the binding conformations and affinities of protein-ligand complexes. Traditional LD methodologies rely on a search and scoring framework, utilizing heuristic algorithms to explore binding conformations and scoring functions to evaluate binding strengths. However, to meet the efficiency demands of SBVS, these algorithms and functions are often simplified, prioritizing speed over accuracy.The emergence of deep learning (DL) has exerted a profound impact on diverse fields, ranging from natural language processing to computer vision and drug discovery. DeepMind's AlphaFold2 has impressively exhibited its ability to accurately predict protein structures solely from amino acid sequences, highlighting the remarkable potential of DL in conformation prediction. This groundbreaking advancement circumvents the traditional search-scoring frameworks in LD, enhancing both accuracy and processing speed and thereby catalyzing a broader adoption of DL algorithms in binding pose prediction. Nevertheless, a consensus on certain aspects remains elusive.In this Account, we delineate the current status of employing DL to augment LD within the VS paradigm, highlighting our contributions to this domain. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and future prospects, drawing insights from our scholarly investigations. Initially, we present an overview of VS and LD, followed by an introduction to DL paradigms, which deviate significantly from traditional search-scoring frameworks. Subsequently, we delve into the challenges associated with the development of DL-based LD (DLLD), encompassing evaluation metrics, application scenarios, and physical plausibility of the predicted conformations. In the evaluation of LD algorithms, it is essential to recognize the multifaceted nature of the metrics. While the accuracy of binding pose prediction, often measured by the success rate, is a pivotal aspect, the scoring/screening power and computational speed of these algorithms are equally important given the pivotal role of LD tools in VS. Regarding application scenarios, early methods focused on blind docking, where the binding site is unknown. However, recent studies suggest a shift toward identifying binding sites rather than solely predicting binding poses within these models. In contrast, LD with a known pocket in VS has been shown to be more practical. Physical plausibility poses another significant challenge. Although DLLD models often achieve higher success rates compared to traditional methods, they may generate poses with implausible local structures, such as incorrect bond angles or lengths, which are disadvantageous for postprocessing tasks like visualization. Finally, we discuss the future perspectives for DLLD, emphasizing the need to improve generalization ability, strike a balance between speed and accuracy, account for protein conformation flexibility, and enhance physical plausibility. Additionally, we delve into the comparison between generative and regression algorithms in this context, exploring their respective strengths and potential.",

        "abstract": "Rare event sampling is a central problem in modern computational chemistry research. Among the existing methods, transition path sampling (TPS) can generate unbiased representations of reaction processes. However, its efficiency depends on the ability to generate reactive trial paths, which in turn depends on the quality of the shooting algorithm used. We propose a new algorithm based on the shooting success rate, i.e., reactivity, measured as a function of a reduced set of collective variables (CVs). These variables are extracted with a machine learning approach directly from TPS simulations, using a multitask objective function. Iteratively, this workflow significantly improves the shooting efficiency without any prior knowledge of the process. In addition, the optimized CVs can be used with biased enhanced sampling methodologies to accurately reconstruct the free energy profiles. We tested the method on three different systems: a two-dimensional toy model, conformational transitions of alanine dipeptide, and hydrolysis of acetyl chloride in bulk water. In the latter, we integrated our workflow with an active learning scheme to learn a reactive machine learning-based potential, which allowed us to study the mechanism and free energy profile with an ab initio-like accuracy.",

Currently, most novel DprE1 inhibitors are discovered through high-throughput screening, while computer-aided drug design (CADD) strategies are expected to promote the discovery process. In this study, with the aid of structure-based virtual screening and computationally guided design, a series of novel scaffold N-(1-(6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyrimidine)-pyrazole) acetamide derivatives with significant antimycobacterial activities were identified.

LK-60 is also the most active DprE1 inhibitor derived from CADD so far. Further studies confirmed their high affinity to DprE1, good safety profiles to gut microbiota and human cells, and synergy effects with either rifampicin or ethambutol, indicating their broad potential for clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "Ribonucleic acid (RNA)-ligand interactions play a pivotal role in a wide spectrum of biological processes, ranging from protein biosynthesis to cellular reproduction. This recognition has prompted the broader acceptance of RNA as a viable candidate for drug targets. Delving into the atomic-scale understanding of RNA-ligand interactions holds paramount importance in unraveling intricate molecular mechanisms and further contributing to RNA-based drug discovery. Computational approaches, particularly molecular docking, offer an efficient way of predicting the interactions between RNA and small molecules. However, the accuracy and reliability of these predictions heavily depend on the performance of scoring functions (SFs). In contrast to the majority of SFs used in RNA-ligand docking, the end-point binding free energy calculation methods, such as molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) and molecular mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA), stand as theoretically more rigorous approaches. Yet, the evaluation of their effectiveness in predicting both binding affinities and binding poses within RNA-ligand systems remains unexplored. This study first reported the performance of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA with diverse solvation models, interior dielectric constants (εin) and force fields in the context of binding affinity prediction for 29 RNA-ligand complexes. MM/GBSA is based on short (5 ns) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in an explicit solvent with the YIL force field; the GBGBn2 model with higher interior dielectric constant (εin = 12, 16 or 20) yields the best correlation (Rp = -0.513), which outperforms the best correlation (Rp = -0.317, rDock) offered by various docking programs. Then, the efficacy of MM/GBSA in identifying the near-native binding poses from the decoys was assessed based on 56 RNA-ligand complexes. However, it is evident that MM/GBSA has limitations in accurately predicting binding poses for RNA-ligand systems, particularly compared with notably proficient docking programs like rDock and PLANTS. The best top-1 success rate achieved by MM/GBSA rescoring is 39.3%, which falls below the best results given by docking programs (50%, PLNATS). This study represents the first evaluation of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA for RNA-ligand systems and is expected to provide valuable insights into their successful application to RNA targets.",

        "abstract": "It is well-known that the potency of a drug is heavily associated with its kinetic and thermodynamic properties with the target. Nuclear receptors (NRs), as an important target family, play important roles in regulating a variety of physiological processes in vivo. However, it is hard to understand the drug-NR interaction process because of the closed structure of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the NR proteins, which apparently hinders the rational design of drugs with controllable kinetic properties. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanism of the ligand-NR interaction process seems necessary to help NR drug design. However, it is usually difficult for experimental approaches to interpret the kinetic process of drug-target interactions. Therefore, in silico methods were utilized to explore the optimal binding/dissociation pathways of the NR ligands. Specifically, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is considered here as the target system since it has been an important target for the treatment of bile acid metabolism-associated diseases, and a series of structures cocrystallized with diverse scaffold ligands were resolved. By using random acceleration molecular dynamics (RAMD) simulation and umbrella sampling (US), 5 main dissociation pathways (pathways I-V) were identified in 11 representative FXR ligands, with most of them (9/11) preferring to go through Pathway III and the remaining two favoring escaping from Pathway I and IV. Furthermore, key residues functioning in the three main dissociation pathways were revealed by the kinetic residue energy analysis (KREA) based on the US trajectories, which may serve as road-marker residues for rapid identification of the (un)binding pathways of FXR ligands. Moreover, the preferred pathways explored by RAMD simulations are in good agreement with the minimum free energy path identified by the US simulations with the Pearson R = 0.76 between the predicted binding affinity and the experimental data, suggesting that RAMD is suitable for applying in large-scale (un)binding-pathway exploration in the case of ligands with obscure binding tunnels to the target.",

However, the data scarcity, combined with the highly non-linear causal relationships between physicochemical and biological properties and conventional molecular featurization schemes, complicates the development of robust molecular machine learning models. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a popular solution, utilizing large-scale, unannotated molecular data to learn a foundational representation of chemical space that might be advantageous for downstream tasks. Yet, existing molecular SSL methods largely overlook chemical knowledge, including molecular structure similarity, scaffold composition, and the context-dependent aspects of molecular properties when operating over the chemical space. They also struggle to learn the subtle variations in structure-activity relationship. This paper introduces a novel pre-training framework that learns robust and generalizable chemical knowledge. It leverages the structural hierarchy within the molecule, embeds them through distinct pre-training tasks across channels, and aggregates channel information in a task-specific manner during fine-tuning. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance across various molecular property benchmarks and offers strong advantages in particularly challenging yet ubiquitous scenarios like activity cliffs.",

Deep learning-based lead optimization takes expert knowledge as a starting point, learning from numerous historical cases about how to modify the structure for better drug-forming properties. However, compared with the more established de novo generation schemes, lead optimization is still an area that requires further exploration. Previously developed models are often limited to resolving one (or few) certain subtask(s) of lead optimization, and most of them can only generate the two-dimensional structures of molecules while disregarding the vital protein-ligand interactions based on the three-dimensional binding poses. To address these challenges, we present a novel tool for lead optimization, named Delete (Deep lead optimization enveloped in protein pocket). Our model can handle all subtasks of lead optimization involving fragment growing, linking, and replacement through a unified deleting (masking) strategy, and is aware of the intricate pocket-ligand interactions through the geometric design of networks. Statistical evaluations and case studies conducted on individual subtasks demonstrate that Delete has a significant ability to produce molecules with superior binding affinities to protein targets and reasonable drug-likeness from given fragments or atoms. This feature may assist medicinal chemists in developing not only me-too/me-better products from existing drugs but also hit-to-lead for first-in-class drugs in a highly efficient manner.",

However, reliable prediction of molecular properties is still challenging when exploring out-of-domain regimes, even for deep neural networks. Therefore, it is important to understand the uncertainty of model predictions, especially when the predictions are used to guide further experiments. In this study, we explored the utility and effectiveness of evidential uncertainty in compound screening. The evidential Graphormer model was proposed for uncertainty-guided discovery of KDM1A/LSD1 inhibitors. The benchmarking results illustrated that (i) Graphormer exhibited comparative predictive power to state-of-the-art models, and (ii) evidential regression enabled well-ranked uncertainty estimates and calibrated predictions. Subsequently, we leveraged time-splitting on the curated KDM1A/LSD1 dataset to simulate out-of-distribution predictions. The retrospective virtual screening showed that the evidential uncertainties helped reduce false positives among the top-acquired compounds and thus enabled higher experimental validation rates. The trained model was then used to virtually screen an independent in-house compound set. The top 50 compounds ranked by two different ranking strategies were experimentally validated, respectively. In general, our study highlighted the importance to understand the uncertainty in prediction, which can be recognized as an interpretable dimension to model predictions.",

Fast-decay times were uniformly below 1 ps, while slow-decay times were found to be as long as 14 ps. Fast-decay times increase with an increase in the initial temperature difference between MW-heated ions/dipoles and the equilibrium system. Slow-decay times were found to be relatively insensitive to the details of the MW-heated nonequilibrium state. Velocity, force, and orientational correlation functions, calculated at equilibrium to explore the natural dynamics of energy transfer, decay well before 1 ps and show little evidence of biexponential decay. In contrast, kinetic energy correlation functions show strong biexponential behavior with slow-decay times as long as 14 ps. We suggest a two-step mechanism involving initial, efficient energy transfer mediated by strongly anharmonic zeolite-guest forces, followed by a slower process mediated by weakly anharmonic couplings among normal modes of the zeolite framework.

In recent years, computational and artificial intelligence-based methods have been actively developed to accelerate and improve the development of therapeutic antibodies. In this study, we developed an end-to-end sequence-based deep learning model, termed AttABseq, for the predictions of the antigen-antibody binding affinity changes connected with antibody mutations. AttABseq is a highly efficient and generic attention-based model by utilizing diverse antigen-antibody complex sequences as the input to predict the binding affinity changes of residue mutations. The assessment on the three benchmark datasets illustrates that AttABseq is 120% more accurate than other sequence-based models in terms of the Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and experimental binding affinity changes. Moreover, AttABseq also either outperforms or competes favorably with the structure-based approaches. Furthermore, AttABseq consistently demonstrates robust predictive capabilities across a diverse array of conditions, underscoring its remarkable capacity for generalization across a wide spectrum of antigen-antibody complexes. It imposes no constraints on the quantity of altered residues, rendering it particularly applicable in scenarios where crystallographic structures remain unavailable.

        "title": "Deep Lead Optimization: Leveraging Generative AI for Structural Modification",
        "abstract": "of using deep-learning-based molecular generation to accelerate discovery of drug candidates has attracted extraordinary attention, and many deep generative models have been developed for automated drug design, termed molecular generation. In general, molecular generation encompasses two main strategies: de novo design, which generates novel molecular structures from scratch, and lead optimization, which refines existing molecules into drug candidates. Among them, lead optimization plays an important role in real-world drug design. For example, it can enable the development of me-better drugs that are chemically distinct yet more effective than the original drugs. It can also facilitate fragment-based drug design, transforming virtual-screened small ligands with low affinity into first-in-class medicines. Despite its importance, automated lead optimization remains underexplored compared to the well-established de novo generative models, due to its reliance on complex biological and chemical knowledge. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic review of traditional computational methods for lead optimization, organizing these strategies into four principal sub-tasks with defined inputs and outputs. This review delves into the basic concepts, goals, conventional CADD techniques, and recent advancements in AIDD. Additionally, we introduce a unified perspective based on constrained subgraph generation to harmonize the methodologies of de novo design and lead optimization. Through this lens, de novo design can incorporate strategies from lead optimization to address the challenge of generating hard-to-synthesize molecules; inversely, lead optimization can benefit from the innovations in de novo design by approaching it as a task of generating molecules conditioned on certain substructures.",

        "abstract": "Accurate prediction of the enzyme comission (EC) numbers for chemical reactions is essential for the understanding and manipulation of enzyme functions, biocatalytic processes and biosynthetic planning. A number of machine leanring (ML)-based models have been developed to classify enzymatic reactions, showing great advantages over costly and long-winded experimental verifications. However, the prediction accuracy for most available models trained on the records of chemical reactions without specifying the enzymatic catalysts is rather limited. In this study, we introduced BEC-Pred, a BERT-based multiclassification model, for predicting EC numbers associated with reactions. Leveraging transfer learning, our approach achieves precise forecasting across a wide variety of Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers solely through analysis of the SMILES sequences of substrates and products. BEC-Pred model outperformed other sequence and graph-based ML methods, attaining a higher accuracy of 91.6%, surpassing them by 5.5%, and exhibiting superior F1 scores with improvements of 6.6% and 6.0%, respectively. The enhanced performance highlights the potential of BEC-Pred to serve as a reliable foundational tool to accelerate the cutting-edge research in synthetic biology and drug metabolism. Moreover, we discussed a few examples on how BEC-Pred could accurately predict the enzymatic classification for the Novozym 435-induced hydrolysis and lipase efficient catalytic synthesis. We anticipate that BEC-Pred will have a positive impact on the progression of enzymatic research.",

        "abstract": "ning-based de novo molecular design has recently gained significant attention. While numerous DL-based generative models have been successfully developed for designing novel compounds, the majority of the generated molecules lack sufficiently novel scaffolds or high drug-like profiles. The aforementioned issues may not be fully captured by commonly used metrics for the assessment of molecular generative models, such as novelty, diversity, and quantitative estimation of the drug-likeness score. To address these limitations, we proposed a genetic algorithm-guided generative model called GARel (genetic algorithm-based receptor-ligand interaction generator), a novel framework for training a DL-based generative model to produce drug-like molecules with novel scaffolds. To efficiently train the GARel model, we utilized dense net to update the parameters based on molecules with novel scaffolds and drug-like features. To demonstrate the capability of the GARel model, we used it to design inhibitors for three targets: AA2AR, EGFR, and SARS-Cov2. The results indicate that GARel-generated molecules feature more diverse and novel scaffolds and possess more desirable physicochemical properties and favorable docking scores. Compared with other generative models, GARel makes significant progress in balancing novelty and drug-likeness, providing a promising direction for the further development of DL-based de novo design methodology with potential impacts on drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "Multisite λ-dynamics (MSLD) is a highly efficient binding free energy calculation method that samples multiple ligands in a single round by assigning different λ values to the alchemical part of each ligand. This method holds great promise for lead optimization (LO) in drug discovery. However, the complex data preparation and simulation process limits its widespread application in diverse protein-ligand systems. To address this challenge, we developed a comprehensive, open-source, and automated workflow for MSLD calculations based on the BLaDE dynamics engine. This workflow incorporates the Ligand Internal and Cartesian coordinate reconstruction-based alignment algorithm (LIC-align) and an optimized maximum common substructure (MCS) search algorithm to accurately generate MSLD multiple topologies with ideal perturbation patterns. Furthermore, our workflow is highly modularized, allowing straightforward integration and extension of various simulation techniques, and is highly accessible to nonexperts. This workflow was validated by calculating the relative binding free energies of large-scale congeneric ligands, many of which have large perturbing groups. The agreement between the calculations and experiments was excellent, with an average unsigned error of 1.08 ± 0.47 kcal/mol. More than 57.1% of the ligands had an error of less than 1.0 kcal/mol, and the perturbations of 6 targets were fully connected via the calculations, while those of 2 targets were connected via both calculations and experimental data. The Pearson correlation coefficient reached 0.88, indicating that the MSLD workflow provides accurate predictions that can guide lead optimization in drug discovery. We also examined the impact of single-site versus multisite perturbations, ligand grouping by perturbing group size, and the position of the anchor atom on the MSLD performance. By integrating our proposed LIC-align and optimized MCS search algorithm along with the coping strategies to handle challenging molecular substructures, our workflow can handle many realistic scenarios more reasonably than all previously published methods. Moreover, we observed that our MSLD workflow achieved similar accuracy to free energy perturbation (FEP) while improving computational efficiency by over 1 order of magnitude in speedup. These findings provide valuable insights and strategies for further MSLD development, making MSLD a competitive tool for lead optimization.",

        "abstract": "AI-assisted synthesis planning has emerged as a valuable tool in accelerating synthetic chemistry for the discovery of new drugs and materials. The template-free approach, which showcases superior generalization capabilities, is seen as the mainstream direction in this field. However, it remains unclear whether such an end-to-end approach can achieve problem-solving performance on par with experienced chemists without fully revealing insights into the chemical mechanisms involved. Moreover, there is a lack of unified and chemically inspired frameworks for improving multitask reaction predictions in this area. In this study, we have addressed these challenges by investigating the impact of fine-grained reaction-type labels on multiple downstream tasks and propose a novel framework named SynCluster. This framework incorporates unsupervised clustering cues into the baseline models and identifies plausible chemical subspaces which is compatible with multitask extensions and can serve as model-independent indicators to effectively enhance the performance of multiple downstream tasks. In retrosynthesis prediction, SynCluster achieves significant improvements of 4.1 and 11.0% in top-1 and top-10 prediction accuracy, respectively, compared to the baseline Molecular Transformer, and achieves a notable enhancement of 13.9% in top-10 accuracy when combined with Retroformer. By incorporating simplified molecular-input line-entry system augmentation, our framework achieves higher top-10 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art sequence-based retrosynthesis models and improves over the baseline on the diversity and validity of reactants. SynCluster also achieves 94.9% top-10 accuracy in forward synthesis prediction and 51.5% top-10 Maxfrag accuracy in reagent prediction. Overall, SynCluster provides a fresh perspective with chemical interpretability and reinforcement of domain knowledge in the synthesis design. It offers a promising solution for improving the accuracy and efficiency of AI-assisted synthesis planning and bridges the gap between template-free approaches and the problem-solving abilities of experienced chemists.",

We validated the MLSFs constructed by ML-PLIC in three benchmark datasets (Directory of Useful Decoys-Enhanced, Active as Decoys and TocoDecoy), demonstrating accuracy outperforming traditional docking tools and competitive performance to the deep learning-based SF, and provided a case study of the Serine/threonine-protein kinase WEE1 in which MLSFs were developed by using the ML-based VS pipeline in ML-PLIC.

Mycelial growth assays showed that deletion of FgBAR1, FgLAC1, FgSUR2 or FgSCS7 resulted in markedly reduced hyphal growth. Fungicide sensitivity tests showed that the sphinganine C4-hydroxylase gene FgSUR2 deletion mutant (ΔFgSUR2) exhibited significantly increased susceptibility to azole fungicides. In addition, this mutant displayed a remarkable increase in cell membrane permeability. Importantly, ΔFgSUR2 was defective in deoxynivalenol (DON) toxisome formation, leading to dramatically decreased DON biosynthesis. Moreover, the deletion of FgSUR2 resulted in dramatically decreased virulence of the pathogen on host plants.

Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is a key enzyme required for DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, and its small subunit RRM2 plays a key role for the enzymatic activity. We predicted monobenzone (MB) as a potential RRM2 target compound based on the crystal structure of RRM2. In vitro, MB inhibited recombinant RNR activity (IC50 = 0.25 μM). Microscale thermophoresis indicated that MB inhibited RNR activity by binding to RRM2. MB inhibited cell proliferation (MTT IC50 = 6-18 μM) and caused dose-dependent DNA synthesis inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in AML cells. The cell cycle arrest was reversed by the addition of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates precursors, suggesting that RNR was the intracellular target of the compound. Moreover, MB overcame drug resistance to the common AML drugs cytarabine and doxorubicin, and treatment with the combination of MB and the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 exerted a synergistic inhibitory effect. Finally, the nude mice xenografts study indicated that MB administration produced a significant inhibitory effect on AML growth with relatively weak toxicity. Thus, we propose that MB has the potential as a novel anti-AML therapeutic agent in the future.",

One of the key structural features of PAPs is the presence of a β-hairpin motif otherwise known as flap. The biological function of the PAPs is highly dependent on the conformational dynamics of the flap region. In apo PAPs, the conformational dynamics of the flap is dominated by the rotational degrees of freedom associated with χ1 and χ2 angles of conserved Tyr (or Phe in some cases). However it is plausible that dihedral order parameters associated with several other residues might play crucial roles in the conformational dynamics of apo PAPs. Due to their size, complexities associated with conformational dynamics and clinical significance (drug targets for malaria, Alzheimer's disease etc.), PAPs provide a challenging testing ground for computational and experimental methods focusing on understanding conformational dynamics and molecular recognition in biomolecules. The opening of the flap region is necessary to accommodate substrate/ligand in the active site of the PAPs. The BIG challenge is to gain atomistic details into how reversible ligand binding/unbinding (molecular recognition) affects the conformational dynamics. Recent reports of kinetics (K i, K d) and thermodynamic parameters (ΔH, TΔS, and ΔG) associated with macro-cyclic ligands bound to BACE1 (belongs to PAP family) provide a perfect challenge (how to deal with big ligands with multiple torsional angles and select optimum order parameters to study reversible ligand binding/unbinding) for computational methods to predict binding free energies and kinetics beyond typical test systems e.g. benzamide-trypsin. In this work, i reviewed several order parameters which were proposed to capture the conformational dynamics and molecular recognition in PAPs. I further highlighted how machine learning methods can be used as order parameters in the context of PAPs. I then proposed some open ideas and challenges in the context of molecular simulation and put forward my case on how biophysical experiments e.g. NMR, time-resolved FRET etc. can be used in conjunction with biomolecular simulation to gain complete atomistic insights into the conformational dynamics of PAPs.",

The results suggest that 28 out of 36 WS phytochemicals show higher affinity for MMP-2 owing to bind with active site residues of S1'-pocket with lower binding energy and smaller inhibition constant (Ki) than considered inhibitors.

Here, two new porphyrin-bis(perylene) triads have been prepared wherein the porphyrin bears two pentafluorophenyl substituents.

The triads were characterized using static and time-resolved optical spectroscopy. The results were analyzed with the aid of molecular-orbital characteristics obtained using density functional theory calculations. Of the four triads, FbT is the most panchromatic in affording the most even distribution of absorption spectral intensity as well as exhibiting the largest wavelength span (380-750 nm). The triads exhibit fluorescence yields (0.35 for FbT-F in toluene) that are substantially greater than for the porphyrin benchmarks (0.049 for FbP-F). The singlet excited-state lifetimes (τS) for the triads in toluene decrease in the order FbT-F (2.7 ns) > FbT (2.0 ns) > ZnT (1.2 ns) ∼ ZnT-F (1.1 ns). The τS values in benzonitrile are FbT (1.3 ns) > FbT-F (1.2 ns) > ZnT-F (0.6 ns) > ZnT (0.2 ns). Thus, the free base triads exhibit relatively long (1.2-2.7 ns) excited-state lifetimes in both polar and nonpolar media. The combined photophysical characteristics indicate that FbT and FbT-F are the best choices for panchromatic light-harvesting systems. Collectively, the findings afford insights into the effects of electronic structure on the panchromatic behavior of ethynyl-linked porphyrin-perylene architectures that can help guide next-generation designs and utilization of these systems.",

However, few attentions have been paid to the relationship between the optimal arrangement of the donor atoms in MBPs and anti-influenza A virus (IAV) efficacy. Given that, the privileged hydroxypyridinones fusing a seven-membered lactam ring with diverse side chains, chiral centers or cyclic systems were designed and synthesized. A structure-activity relationship study resulted in a hit compound 16l (IC50 = 2.868 ± 0.063 μM against IAV polymerase), the seven-membered lactam ring of which was fused a pyrrolidine ring. Further optimization of the hydrophobic binding groups on 16l afforded a lead compound (R, S)-16s, which exhibited a 64-fold more potent inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.045 ± 0.002 μM) toward IAV polymerase. Moreover, (R, S)-16s demonstrated a potent anti-IAV efficacy (EC50 = 0.134 ± 0.093 μM) and weak cytotoxicity (CC50 = 15.35 μM), indicating the high selectivity of (R, S)-16s.

Vaccine design targeting MHC generally aims to find epitopes with a high binding affinity for MHC presentation. Nevertheless, to find novel epitopes usually requires high-throughput screening of bulk peptide database, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, more unaffordable, and very expensive. Excitingly, the past several years have witnessed the great success of artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, such as natural language processing (NLP, e.g., GPT-4), protein structure prediction and engineering (e.g., AlphaFold2), and so on. Therefore, herein, we propose a deep reinforcement-learning (RL)-based generative algorithm, RLpMIEC, to quantitatively design peptide targeting MHC-I systems. Specifically, RLpMIEC combines the energetic spectrum (namely, the molecular interaction energy component, MIEC) based on the peptide-MHC interaction and the sequence information to generate peptides with strong binding affinity and precise MIEC spectra to accelerate the discovery of candidate peptide vaccines. RLpMIEC performs well in all the generative capability evaluations and can generate peptides with strong binding affinities and precise MIECs and, moreover, with high interpretability, demonstrating its powerful capability in participation for accelerating peptide-based vaccine development.",

In this study, we introduced Token-Mol, a token-only 3D drug design model. This model encodes all molecular information, including 2D and 3D structures, as well as molecular property data, into tokens, which transforms classification and regression tasks in drug discovery into probabilistic prediction problems, thereby enabling learning through a unified paradigm. Token-Mol is built on the transformer decoder architecture and trained using random causal masking techniques. Additionally, we proposed the Gaussian cross-entropy (GCE) loss function to overcome the challenges in regression tasks, significantly enhancing the capacity of LLMs to learn continuous numerical values. Through a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), Token-Mol achieves performance comparable to or surpassing existing task-specific methods across various downstream tasks, including pocket-based molecular generation, conformation generation, and molecular property prediction. Compared to existing molecular pre-trained models, Token-Mol exhibits superior proficiency in handling a wider range of downstream tasks essential for drug design. Notably, our approach improves regression task accuracy by approximately 30% compared to similar token-only methods.

Here, we employ computational simulation methods to elucidate the activation process and key events associated with the mGlu2, including a detailed analysis of its conformational transitions, the binding of agonists, Gi protein coupling, and the guanosine diphosphate (GDP) release. Our results demonstrate that the activation of mGlu2 is a stepwise process and several energy barriers need to be overcome. Moreover, we also identify the rate-determining step of the mGlu2's transition from the agonist-bound state to its active state. From the perspective of free-energy analysis, we find that the conformational dynamics of mGlu2's subunit follow coupled rather than discrete, independent actions. Asymmetric dimerization is critical for receptor activation. Our calculation results are consistent with the observation of cross-linking and fluorescent-labeled blot experiments, thus illustrating the reliability of our calculations. Besides, we also identify potential key residues in the Gi protein binding position on mGlu2, mGlu2 dimer's TM6-TM6 interface, and Gi α5 helix by the change of energy barriers after mutation.

However, the lack of the detailed interaction between AR and its antagonists poses a major obstacle to the design of novel AR antagonists. Here, funnel metadynamics is employed to elucidate the inherent regulation mechanisms of three AR antagonists (hydroxyflutamide, enzalutamide, and darolutamide) on AR. For the first time it is observed that the binding of antagonists significantly disturbed the C-terminus of AR helix-11, thereby disrupting the specific internal hydrophobic contacts of AR-LBD and correspondingly the communication between AR ligand binding pocket (AR-LBP), activation function 2 (AF2), and binding function 3 (BF3). The subsequent bioassays verified the necessity of the hydrophobic contacts for AR function. Furthermore, it is found that darolutamide, a newly approved AR antagonist capable of fighting almost all reported drug resistant AR mutants, can induce antagonistic binding structure. Subsequently, docking-based virtual screening toward the dominant binding conformation of AR for darolutamide is conducted, and three novel AR antagonists with favorable binding affinity and strong capability to combat drug resistance are identified by in vitro bioassays.

Although previous studies have addressed the performance of AF2 structures in virtual screening (VS), a more comprehensive investigation is still necessary considering the paramount importance of structural accuracy in drug design. In this study, we evaluate the performance of AF2 structures in VS across three common drug discovery scenarios: targets with holo, apo, and AF2 structures; targets with only apo and AF2 structures; and targets exclusively with AF2 structures. We utilized both the traditional physics-based Glide and the deep-learning-based scoring function RTMscore to rank the compounds in the DUD-E, DEKOIS 2.0, and DECOY data sets. The results demonstrate that, overall, the performance of VS on AF2 structures is comparable to that on apo structures but notably inferior to that on holo structures across diverse scenarios. Moreover, when a target has solely AF2 structure, selecting the holo structure of the target from different subtypes within the same protein family produces comparable results with the AF2 structure for VS on the data set of the AF2 structures, and significantly better results than the AF2 structures on its own data set. This indicates that utilizing AF2 structures for docking-based VS may not yield most satisfactory outcomes, even when solely AF2 structures are available. Moreover, we rule out the possibility that the variations in VS performance between the binding pockets of AF2 and holo structures arise from the differences in their biological assembly composition.",

        "abstract": "Cyclic peptides have emerged as a highly promising class of therapeutic molecules owing to their favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including stability and permeability. Currently, many clinically approved cyclic peptides are derived from natural products or their derivatives, and the development of molecular docking techniques for cyclic peptide discovery holds great promise for expanding the applications and potential of this class of molecules. Given the availability of numerous docking programs, there is a pressing need for a systematic evaluation of their performance, specifically on protein-cyclic peptide systems. In this study, we constructed an extensive benchmark data set called CPSet, consisting of 493 protein-cyclic peptide complexes. Based on this data set, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 10 docking programs, including Rosetta, AutoDock CrankPep, and eight protein-small molecule docking programs (i.e., AutoDock, AudoDock Vina, Glide, GOLD, LeDock, rDock, MOE, and Surflex). The evaluation encompassed the assessment of the sampling power, docking power, and scoring power of these programs. The results revealed that all of the tested protein-small molecule docking programs successfully sampled the binding conformations when using the crystal conformations as the initial structures. Among them, rDock exhibited outstanding performance, achieving a remarkable 94.3% top-100 sampling success rate. However, few programs achieved successful predictions of the binding conformations using tLEaP-generated conformations as the initial structures. Within this scheme, AutoDock CrankPep yielded the highest top-100 sampling success rate of 29.6%. Rosetta's scoring function outperformed the others in selecting optimal conformations, resulting in an impressive top-1 docking success rate of 87.6%. Nevertheless, all the tested scoring functions displayed limited performance in predicting binding affinity, with MOE@Affinity dG exhibiting the highest Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.378. It is therefore suggested to use an appropriate combination of different docking programs for given tasks in real applications. We expect that this work will offer valuable insights into selecting the appropriate docking programs for protein-cyclic peptide complexes.",

        "abstract": "Rapid generation of diagnostics is paramount to understand epidemiology and to control the spread of emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Computational methods to predict serodiagnostic epitopes that are specific for the pathogen could help accelerate the development of new diagnostics. A systematic survey of 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins was conducted to assess whether existing B-cell epitope prediction methods, combined with comprehensive mining of sequence databases and structural data, could predict whether a particular protein would be suitable for serodiagnosis. Nine of the predictions were validated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the ELISA format using plasma and sera from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a further 11 predictions were compared to the recent literature. Results appeared to be in agreement with 12 of the predictions, in disagreement with 3, while a further 5 were deemed inconclusive. We showed that two of our top five candidates, the N-terminal fragment of the nucleoprotein and the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, have the highest sensitivity and specificity and signal-to-noise ratio for detecting COVID-19 sera/plasma by ELISA. Mixing the two antigens together for coating ELISA plates led to a sensitivity of 94% (N = 80 samples from persons with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection), and a specificity of 97.2% (N = 106 control samples).",

        "abstract": "Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is implicated in the genesis of multiple malignant tumors. Lorlatinib stands out as the most advanced and effective inhibitor currently used in the clinic for the treatment of ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. However, resistance to lorlatinib has inevitably manifested over time, with double/triple mutations of G1202, L1196, L1198, C1156 and I1171 frequently observed in clinical practice, and tumors regrow within a short time after treatment with lorlatinib. Therefore, elucidating the mechanism of resistance to lorlatinib is paramount in paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies and the development of next-generation drugs. In this study, we leveraged multiple computational methodologies to delve into the resistance mechanisms of three specific double mutations of ALKG1202R/L1196M, ALKG1202R/L1198F and ALKI1171N/L1198F to lorlatinib. We analyzed these mechanisms through qualitative (PCA, DCCM) and quantitative (MM/GBSA, US) kinetic analyses. The qualitative analysis shows that these mutations exert minimal perturbations on the conformational dynamics of the structural domains of ALK. The energetic and structural assessments show that the van der Waals interactions, formed by the conserved residue Leu1256 within the ATP-binding site and the residues Glu1197 and Met1199 in the hinge domain with lorlatinib, play integral roles in the occurrence of drug resistance. Furthermore, the US simulation results elucidate that the pathways through which lorlatinib dissociates vary across mutant systems, and the distinct environments during the dissociation process culminate in diverse resistance mechanisms. Collectively, these insights provide important clues for the design of novel inhibitors to combat resistance.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning (DL)-driven efficient synthesis planning may profoundly transform the paradigm for designing novel pharmaceuticals and materials. However, the progress of many DL-assisted synthesis planning (DASP) algorithms has suffered from the lack of reliable automated pathway evaluation tools. As a critical metric for evaluating chemical reactions, accurate prediction of reaction yields helps improve the practicality of DASP algorithms in the real-world scenarios. Currently, accurately predicting yields of interesting reactions still faces numerous challenges, mainly including the absence of high-quality generic reaction yield datasets and robust generic yield predictors. To compensate for the limitations of high-throughput yield datasets, we curated a generic reaction yield dataset containing 12 reaction categories and rich reaction condition information. Subsequently, by utilizing 2 pretraining tasks based on chemical reaction masked language modeling and contrastive learning, we proposed a powerful bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)-based reaction yield predictor named Egret. It achieved comparable or even superior performance to the best previous models on 4 benchmark datasets and established state-of-the-art performance on the newly curated dataset. We found that reaction-condition-based contrastive learning enhances the model's sensitivity to reaction conditions, and Egret is capable of capturing subtle differences between reactions involving identical reactants and products but different reaction conditions. Furthermore, we proposed a new scoring function that incorporated Egret into the evaluation of multistep synthesis routes. Test results showed that yield-incorporated scoring facilitated the prioritization of literature-supported high-yield reaction pathways for target molecules. In addition, through meta-learning strategy, we further improved the reliability of the model's prediction for reaction types with limited data and lower data quality. Our results suggest that Egret holds the potential to become an essential component of the next-generation DASP tools.",

        "abstract": "-based machine learning algorithms have been utilized to predict the properties of protein-protein interaction (PPI) complexes, such as binding affinity, which is critical for understanding biological mechanisms and disease treatments. While most existing algorithms represent PPI complex graph structures at the atom-scale or residue-scale, these representations can be computationally expensive or may not sufficiently integrate finer chemical-plausible interaction details for improving predictions. Here, we introduce MCGLPPI, a novel geometric representation learning framework that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) with the MARTINI molecular coarse-grained (CG) model to predict overall PPI properties accurately and efficiently. This framework maps proteins onto a concise CG-scale complex graph, where nodes represent CG beads and edges encode chemically plausible interactions. The GNN-based encoder is tailored to extract high-quality representations from this graph, efficiently capturing the overall properties of the protein complex structure. Extensive experiments on three different downstream PPI property prediction tasks demonstrate that MCGLPPI achieves competitive performance compared with the counterparts at the atom- and residue-scale, but with only a third of the computational resource consumption. Furthermore, the CG-scale pre-training on protein domain-domain interaction structures enhances its predictive capabilities for PPI tasks. MCGLPPI offers an effective and efficient solution for PPI overall property predictions, serving as a promising tool for the large-scale analysis of biomolecular interactions.",

Broadly, this might be divided into avenues that leverage chromatin information to better annotate and decode plant genomes, and into complementary strategies that aim to identify and select for heritable epialleles that control crop traits independent of underlying genotype.

However, despite significant success, the restriction of the scarcity of protein-ligand data prevents the models from fully exploiting the learning chemical space and discovering unexplored potential drugs. The limited chemical space sampling contrasts with the original intention of generation models to explore a broader chemical space, leading to what we term the Chemical Space Generation Paradox. To address the proposed paradox, we developed ECloudGen with the following attributes: (1) Fundamental Physical Representation: We introduce the electron cloud representation, unifying all biological forces under one representation, offering a compact and continuous learning space. (2) Broad and Structurally Ordered Chemical Space: Utilizing electron clouds as generative agents, ECloudGen leverages data without binding structure to access a broader chemical space. In implementation, ECloudDiff as a latent ECloud-based diffusion model is established to sample high-fidelity electron clouds conditioned on pockets’s structure; and CEMP as a novel contrastive learning strategy is proposed to structurally organize the chemical space, thus enabling controllable generation. Subsequent experiments confirm ECloud-Gen’s state-of-the-art performance, in generating chemically feasible molecules with high binding efficacy, drug-likeness, and other chemical properties. Besides, ECloudGen proves to encompass a broader chemical space and also demonstrates superiority in controllable generation in extensive experiments.",

These functions are carried out by FA binding proteins (FABPs) that recognize and transport FAs. Although the crystal structure of the FA-FABPs complex has long been characterized, the mechanism behind FA binding and dissociation from FABP remains unclear. This study employed conventional MD simulations and enhanced sampling technologies to investigate the atomic-scale complexes of heart fatty acid binding proteins and stearic acid (SA). The results revealed two primary pathways for the binding or dissociation of the flexible long-chain ligand, with the orientation of the SA carboxyl head during dissociation determining the chosen path. Conformational changes in the portal region of FABP during the ligand binding/unbinding were found to be trivial, and the overturn of the ″cap″ or the unfolding of the α2 helix was not required. This study resolves the long-standing debate on the binding mechanism of SA with the long-flexible tail to FABP, which significantly improves the understanding of the transport mechanism of FABPs and the development of related therapeutic agents.",

        "abstract": "Chemical reaction prediction, involving forward synthesis and retrosynthesis prediction, is a fundamental problem in organic synthesis. A popular computational paradigm formulates synthesis prediction as a sequence-to-sequence translation problem, where the typical SMILES is adopted for molecule representations. However, the general-purpose SMILES neglects the characteristics of chemical reactions, where the molecular graph topology is largely unaltered from reactants to products, resulting in the suboptimal performance of SMILES if straightforwardly applied. In this article, we propose the root-aligned SMILES (R-SMILES), which specifies a tightly aligned one-to-one mapping between the product and the reactant SMILES for more efficient synthesis prediction. Due to the strict one-to-one mapping and reduced edit distance, the computational model is largely relieved from learning the complex syntax and dedicated to learning the chemical knowledge for reactions. We compare the proposed R-SMILES with various state-of-the-art baselines and show that it significantly outperforms them all, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method.",

Method and Materials  Institutional review board-approved retrospective study, with waiver for informed consent. Contrast-enhanced chest CT performed during 6 months were reviewed for presence of VAMB in venous segments visible in chest CT (subclavian, brachiocephalic vein, superior vena cava) and cardiac chambers. VAMB volumes were quantified through a semiautomatic method (MIAlite plugin for OsiriX), using a region of interest (ROI) covering the bubble. With basal results, protocols for correct injection technique were reinforced, and VAMB were estimated again at 1 and 3 months. Six months later, questionnaires were sent to the CT technologists to inquire about their perception of VAMB. Descriptive measures with central distribution and dispersion were performed; statistical significance was considered at p  < 0.05. Results  A total of 602 chest CTA were analyzed, 332 were women (55.14%), with a median age of 58 (interquartile range [IQR] 44-72) years. Among those, 16.11% (100 cases) presented VAMB. Most were emergency department patients (51.6%), male (50.3%), with a median age of 54 (IQR 26) years. There was no difference on detection of VAMB regarding sex ( p  = 0.19), age ( p  = 0.46), or referral diagnosis ( p  = 0.35). Mean air bubbles volume was 0.2 mL (range 0.01-3.4 mL). After intervention, the number of exams with VAMB dropped to 3.29 % (3/91) ( p  < 0.001). On the 6-month query, 50% of the technicians still considered that VMAB is inevitable, and 60% thought that the occurrence is not associated to risk, and therefore, not actionable. Conclusion  VAMB are a frequent finding in chest CTA, and being independent from patient-related variables, it is likely due to technical issues such as intravenous access manipulation during the exam. Reduction after reinforcement of proper performance, and certification of a low concern from CT technicians for any risk associated, provides evidence that there is normalization of deviance in this everyday procedure.",

        "abstract": "sition metals, such as Rh, Ir, Pd and Pt, have a strong tendency to form a square-planar 16-electron complex. Although this feature has been widely used in organometallics to develop homogeneous catalysts, a single-atom heterogeneous analogue has not yet been reported. In this work, we show that a 16-electron complex may act as an important transition state in the CO oxidation over a single Pt atom supported by a MoS2 monolayer (Pt/MoS2). The catalytic oxidation reaction prefers to start with the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) reaction, where the CO and O2 molecules are first co-adsorbed on the Pt atom, then cross a small barrier of 0.40 eV to form a square-planar 16-electron intermediate state, and subsequently the first CO2 is released. The activation barrier of the following Eley–Rideal (E–R) reaction is only 0.23 eV. The superior catalytic reactivity of the Pt/MoS2 surface can be explained by the quantum confinement effect of the Pt-5d orbitals and the stability of the square-planar 16-electron transition state. In addition, MoS2 may serve as a defect-free two dimensional anchoring substrate for Pt atomic adsorption. It provides not only a very large surface-to-volume ratio, but also a well-defined structure with a uniform distribution of anchoring points. The square-planar 16-electron intermediate state of the L–H reaction, together with the new MoS2 anchoring substrate, may provide a new opportunity for the design of single-atom catalysts on two-dimensional surfaces.",

To identify novel PI3K inhibitors, we performed a high throughput virtual screen and identified several novel small molecule compounds, including PIK-C98 (C98). The cell-free enzymatic studies showed that C98 inhibited all class I PI3Ks at nano- or low micromolar concentrations but had no effects on AKT or mTOR activity. Molecular docking analysis revealed that C98 interfered with the ATP-binding pockets of PI3Ks by forming H-bonds and arene-H interactions with specific amino acid residues. The cellular assays demonstrated that C98 specifically inhibited PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, but had no effects on other kinases and proteins including IGF-1R, ERK, p38, c-Src, PTEN, and STAT3. Inhibition of PI3K by C98 led to myeloma cell apoptosis. Furthermore, oral administration of C98 delayed tumor growth in two independent human myeloma xenograft models in nude mice but did not show overt toxicity.

Recently, GO has been shown to be the most efficient inhibitor for α-chymotrypsin (ChT) compared with all other artificial inhibitors. However, how GO interacts with bioactive proteins and its potential in enzyme engineering have been rarely explored. In this study, we investigate the interactions between ChT and graphene/GO by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. We find that ChT is adsorbed onto the surface of GO or graphene during 100 ns MD simulations. The α-helix of ChT plays as an important anchor to interact with GO. The cationic and hydrophobic residues of ChT form strong interactions with GO, which leads to the deformation of the active site of ChT and the inhibition of ChT. In comparison, the active site of ChT is only slightly affected after ChT adsorbed onto the graphene surface. In addition, the secondary structure of ChT is not affected after it is adsorbed onto GO or graphene surface. Our results illustrate the mechanism of the interaction between GO/graphene and enzyme and provide guidelines for designing efficient artificial inhibitors.",

To decipher the binding specificity of PDZ domain, we analyzed the interactions between 11 mouse PDZ domains and 217 [corrected] peptides using a method called MIEC-SVM, which energetically characterizes the domain-peptide interaction using molecular interaction energy components (MIECs) and predicts binding specificity using support vector machine (SVM). Cross-validation and leave-one-domain-out test showed that the MIEC-SVM using all 44 PDZ-peptide residue pairs at the interaction interface outperformed the sequence-based methods in the literature. A further feature (residue pair) selection procedure illustrated that 16 residue pairs were uninformative to the binding specificity, even though they contributed significantly (~50%) to the binding energy. If only using the 28 informative residue pairs, the performance of the MIEC-SVM on predicting the PDZ binding specificity was significantly improved. This analysis suggests that the informative and uninformative residue interactions between the PDZ domain and the peptide may represent those contributing to binding specificity and affinity, respectively. We performed additional structural and energetic analyses to shed light on understanding how the PDZ-peptide recognition is established. The success of the MIEC-SVM method on PDZ domains in this study and SH3 domains in our previous studies illustrates its generality on characterizing protein-peptide interactions and understanding protein recognition from a structural and energetic viewpoint.",

        "abstract": "Determination of the binding specificity of SH3 domain, a peptide recognition module (PRM), is important to understand their biological functions and reconstruct the SH3-mediated protein-protein interaction network. In the present study, the SH3-peptide interactions for both class I and II SH3 domains were characterized by the intermolecular residue-residue interaction network. We developed generic MIEC-SVM models to infer SH3 domain-peptide recognition specificity that achieved satisfactory prediction accuracy. By investigating the domain-peptide recognition mechanisms at the residue level, we found that the class-I and class-II binding peptides have different binding modes even though they occupy the same binding site of SH3. Furthermore, we predicted the potential binding partners of SH3 domains in the yeast proteome and constructed the SH3-mediated protein-protein interaction network. Comparison with the experimentally determined interactions confirmed the effectiveness of our approach. This study showed that our sophisticated computational approach not only provides a powerful platform to decipher protein recognition code at the molecular level but also allows identification of peptide-mediated protein interactions at a proteomic scale. We believe that such an approach is general to be applicable to other domain-peptide interactions.",

To meet the increasing needs for TCM-related data resources, we developed ETCM, an Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine. ETCM includes comprehensive and standardized information for the commonly used herbs and formulas of TCM, as well as their ingredients. The herb basic property and quality control standard, formula composition, ingredient drug-likeness, as well as many other information provided by ETCM can serve as a convenient resource for users to obtain thorough information about a herb or a formula. To facilitate functional and mechanistic studies of TCM, ETCM provides predicted target genes of TCM ingredients, herbs, and formulas, according to the chemical fingerprint similarity between TCM ingredients and known drugs. A systematic analysis function is also developed in ETCM, which allows users to explore the relationships or build networks among TCM herbs, formulas,ingredients, gene targets, and related pathways or diseases.

        "abstract": "1836 Clioquinol (5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline, CQ) is an old and effective antifungal and amoebicidal drug but is restricted or discontinued in some countries because of its suspect causality in inducing subacute myelo-optic neuropathy, however it has been recently revitalized as an anti-cancer drug candidate at both in vitro and in vivo models. Our previous study suggested that CQ induced cell death and displayed anti-leukemia and anti-myeloma activity (Mao × et al, Leukemia, 2009), but its mechanisms are not well known. In this study, we demonstrated that clioquinol-induced cell death is via intrinsic rather than extrinsic apoptotic pathway, clioquinol-induced apoptosis depends on the activation of caspase-9 and -3. Because zinc is essential for the enzymatic activity of histone deacetylases (HDAC) which is currently emerging as a novel target for apoptotis and cancer treatment, and clioquinol is a strong chelator of zinc ion, we questioned whether clioquinol could interfere with HDAC activity by binding to zinc. Thus, we first examined the effects of clioquinol on the most often used hallmarks for HDAC inhibitions, including cyclin D, p21(CIP1), and p27(KIP1) (Nature Reviews Cancer, 2006). DNA microarray analysis indicated that clioquinol and its analogs significantly up-regulated the transcriptional level of p21 > 2–10 folds within 24 hr. The increased expression of p21(CIP1) protein was further confirmed by western blotting assay in various cell lines and primary patient samples. Clioquinol induced p21(CIP1) expression at concentrations as low as 5 μM witin 24 hr. At the same concentration, tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulator p27 (KIP1) was also increased. In addition, clioquinol also down-regulated expression of D-cyclins, including cyclin D2 and D3 in tested cell lines at a concentration consistent with that induced cell apoptosis. All these changes by clioquinol resulted in cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in both leukemia and myeloma cell lines. Because these genes (cyclin D, p21 and p27) are most associated with histone acetylases, we next checked whether clioquinol is effective in inhibiting HDAC activity. Both leukemia and myeloma cell lines and primary patient samples were applied for the analysis of acetylation status of histone 3 (Ac-H3). Using trichostatin A (TSA) as a positive control, we found that clioquinol accumulated Ac-H3 in all tested cell lines and primary patient samples in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which strongly suggested that clioquinol interfere with HDAC activity. Subsequently, we analyzed the interaction of clioquinol and HDAC. Just like TSA, clioquinol was docked into the active pocket of HDAC, where clioquinol competitively binds to zinc at the active center, which was confirmed by zinc addition. Zinc addition partially abolished the effects of clioquinol on HDAC activity. Thus, our study indicated that clioquinol-induced cell death in both leukemia and myeloma was via an apoptotic pathway by interfering with HDAC activity.

        "abstract": "The ability to cross the intestinal cell membrane is a fundamental prerequisite of a drug compound. However, the experimental measurement of such an important property is a costly and highly time consuming step of the drug development process because it is necessary to synthesize the compound first. Therefore, in silico modelling of intestinal absorption, which can be carried out at very early stages of drug design, is an appealing alternative procedure which is based mainly on multivariate statistical analysis such as partial least squares (PLS) and neural networks (NN). Our implementation of neural network models for the prediction of intestinal absorption is based on the correlation of Caco-2 cell apparent permeability (P (app)) values, as a measure of intestinal absorption, to the structures of two different data sets of drug candidates. Several molecular descriptors of the compounds were calculated and the optimal subsets were selected using a genetic algorithm; therefore, the method was indicated as Genetic Algorithm-Neural Network (GA-NN). A methodology combining a genetic algorithm search with neural network analysis applied to the modelling of Caco-2 P (app) has never been presented before, although the two procedures have been already employed separately. Moreover, we provide new Caco-2 cell permeability measurements for more than two hundred compounds. Interestingly, the selected descriptors show to possess physico-chemical connotations which are in excellent accordance with the well known relevant molecular properties involved in the cellular membrane permeation phenomenon: hydrophilicity, hydrogen bonding propensity, hydrophobicity and molecular size. The predictive ability of the models, although rather good for a preliminary study, is somewhat affected by the poor precision of the experimental Caco-2 measurements. Finally, the generalization ability of one model was checked on an external test set not derived from the data sets used to build the models. The result obtained is of interesting practical application and underlines that the successful model construction is strictly dependent on the structural space representation of the data set used for model development.",

        "title": "Empirical aqueous solvation model for protein based on accessible surface areas",
        "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations of barnase have been conducted both in water and in 8 M urea solution for 500 ps at 25 degrees C and for 2000 ps at 85 degrees C. The final structure of the aqueous simulation at room temperature matches closely the structure obtained by NMR and the experimentally observed protections from isotopic exchange. The comparison of the structures generated by the aqueous simulation at 85 degrees C reveals a trajectory composed of groups of geometrically related structures separated by narrow regions of rapid change in structure. The first of these regions displays changes in backbone rmsd to the crystal structure and solvent-accessible area suggestive of a transition state, while the properties observed during the final 300 ps of the simulation are consistent with a stable intermediate. These assignments were confirmed by calculation of the \"progress along the reaction coordinate\" phi-values using an empirical equation based on a linear response method. The pathway of unfolding defined in this fashion agrees well with the experimental results of site-directed mutagenesis in terms of secondary structure content of the transition state and the intermediate and reproduces the relative stability of the different elements of secondary structure. The results of the simulations in urea suggest a mechanism at the molecular level for its well-known enhancement of the denaturation of proteins. The analysis of radial distribution functions shows that the first solvation shell of the protein is enriched in urea relative to the bulk solvent. The displacement of water molecules allows greater exposure of hydrophobic side chains, as witnessed particularly in the analysis of solvent-accessible surface areas at the higher temperature. Almost all urea molecules in the first shell form at least one hydrogen bond with the protein. They provide a more favorable environment for accommodation of the remaining water molecules, and they facilitate the separation of secondary structure elements by acting as a bridge between groups previously forming intraprotein hydrogen bonds.",

IL-11 acts on cells expressing gp130 and the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R) alpha-subunit (IL-11Ralpha). The structural epitopes of IL-11 required for the recruitment of the individual receptor subunits have not yet been defined. Based on the structure of CNTF, a three-dimensional model of human IL-11 was built. Using this model, 10 surface exposed amino acid residues of IL-11 were selected for mutagenesis using analogies to the well-characterized receptor recruitment sites of IL-6, CNTF, and LIF. The respective mutants of human IL-11 were expressed as soluble fusion proteins in bacteria. Their biological activities were determined on HepG2 and Ba/F3-130-11alpha cells. Several mutants with substantially decreased bioactivity and one hyperagonistic mutant were identified and further analyzed with regard to recruitment of IL-11Ralpha and gp130. The low-activity mutant I171D still binds IL-11Ralpha but fails to recruit gp130, whereas the hyperagonistic variant R135E more efficiently engages the IL-11R subunits. The low-activity mutants R190E and L194D failed to bind to IL-11Ralpha. These findings reveal a common mechanism of receptor recruitment in the family of IL-6-type cytokines and offer considerable perspectives for the rational design of IL-11 antagonists and hyperagonists.",

We applied this method to four targets (HCV NS3 protease, Cathepsin K, EGFR, and XPO1) with known crystal structures and known covalent inhibitors. We implemented a customized \"VS mode\" of the Schrödinger Covalent Docking algorithm (CovDock), which we refer to as CovDock-VS. Known actives and target-specific sets of decoys were docked to selected X-ray structures, and poses were filtered based on noncovalent protein-ligand interactions known to be important for activity. We were able to retrieve 71%, 72%, and 77% of the known actives for Cathepsin K, HCV NS3 protease, and EGFR within 5% of the decoy library, respectively. With the more challenging XPO1 target, where no specific interactions with the protein could be used for postprocessing of the docking results, we were able to retrieve 95% of the actives within 30% of the decoy library and achieved an early enrichment factor (EF1%) of 33. The poses of the known actives bound to existing crystal structures of 4 targets were predicted with an average RMSD of 1.9 Å. To the best of our knowledge, CovDock-VS is the first fully automated tool for efficient virtual screening of covalent inhibitors. Importantly, CovDock-VS can handle multiple chemical reactions within the same library, only requiring a generic SMARTS-based predefinition of the reaction. CovDock-VS provides a fast and accurate way of differentiating actives from decoys without significantly deteriorating the accuracy of the predicted poses for covalent protein-ligand complexes. Therefore, we propose CovDock-VS as an efficient structure-based virtual screening method for discovery of novel and diverse covalent ligands.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge in drug design is to obtain compounds that bind selectively to their target receptors and do not cause side-effects by binding to other similar receptors. Here, we investigate strategies for applying COMBINE (COMparative BINding Energy) analysis, in conjunction with PIPSA (Protein Interaction Property Similarity Analysis) and ligand docking methods, to address this problem. We evaluate these approaches by application to diverse sets of inhibitors of three structurally related serine proteases of medical relevance: thrombin, trypsin, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). We generated target-specific scoring functions (COMBINE models) for the three targets using training sets of ligands with known inhibition constants and structures of their receptor-ligand complexes. These COMBINE models were compared with the PIPSA results and experimental data on receptor selectivity. These scoring functions highlight the ligand-receptor interactions that are particularly important for binding specificity for the different targets. To predict target selectivity in virtual screening, compounds were docked into the three protein binding sites using the program GOLD and the docking solutions were re-ranked with the target-specific scoring functions and computed electrostatic binding free energies. Limits in the accuracy of some of the docking solutions and difficulties in scoring them adversely affected the predictive ability of the target specific scoring functions. Nevertheless, the target-specific scoring functions enabled the selectivity of ligands to thrombin versus trypsin and uPA to be predicted.",

In this study, based on 11 public datasets covering various property endpoints, the predictive capacity and computational efficiency of the prediction models developed by eight machine learning (ML) algorithms, including four descriptor-based models (SVM, XGBoost, RF and DNN) and four graph-based models (GCN, GAT, MPNN and Attentive FP), were extensively tested and compared. The results demonstrate that on average the descriptor-based models outperform the graph-based models in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. SVM generally achieves the best predictions for the regression tasks. Both RF and XGBoost can achieve reliable predictions for the classification tasks, and some of the graph-based models, such as Attentive FP and GCN, can yield outstanding performance for a fraction of larger or multi-task datasets. In terms of computational cost, XGBoost and RF are the two most efficient algorithms and only need a few seconds to train a model even for a large dataset. The model interpretations by the SHAP method can effectively explore the established domain knowledge for the descriptor-based models. Finally, we explored use of these models for virtual screening (VS) towards HIV and demonstrated that different ML algorithms offer diverse VS profiles.

        "title": "Supporting Information A Novel Metal-free Two-Dimensional Material for Photocatalytic Water Splitting------Phosphorus Nitride (γ-PN)",
        "abstract": "ight-driven water-splitting technology has attracted wide attention because of its sustainable and renewable production of hydrogen. The key to photocatalysis field is to search materials with suitable oxidizing and reducing potential. Herein we investigated the novel 2D γ-phosphorus nitride (γ-PN) monolayer as a candidate photocatalyst for reducing water into hydrogen and oxygen from the first-principles and molecular dynamics calculations. Our results show that the 2D γ-PN monolayer is an indirect semiconductor whose conduction and valence band edges matches well with the chemical potential of H+/H2 and O2/H2O. Strain effect is considered to tune the electronic properties of γ-PN. The calculation results reveal that tensile strain decreases the band gap and upshifts the work function of the γ-PN monolayer. The γ-PN monolayer at the 10% tensile strain shows the optimal performance in catalysing the water-splitting due to the low band gap and the better absorption spectrum at the UV-visible light range. Furthermore, the molecular dynamics shows that the γ-PN in the aqueous solution always keep stable after 100 ps simulation. Both the density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation reflect that the γ-PN monolayer is reliable and promising as a water-splitting photocatalyst.",

        "title": "Supplementary Information Transport of nucleosides in vcCNT facilitated by sodium gradients from Molecular Dynamics Simulations",
        "abstract": "es are required for DNA and RNA synthesis, and the nucleoside adenosine has a function in a variety of signaling processes. Nucleosides require a specialized class of integral membrane proteins, known as nucleoside transporters (NTs), for specific transport across cell membranes. NTs are also important determinants for the transport of nucleoside-derived drugs across cell membranes. Recently, the crystal structure of the vcCNT (Vibrio cholerae Concentrative Nucleoside Transporter) was reported. Here we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the vcCNT structure in the presence of various sodium gradients, since CNTs are sodium-coupled transporters. The results highlight the important role of sodium bound to the vcCNT in the transport of uridine. Our MD simulations show that, without NaCl, uridine remains stable in the binding pocket of the vcCNT. In the presence of 20 mM NaCl, uridine moves from the binding pocket and approaches the entrance of the intracellular side. In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, uridine passes through most part of the entrance and approaches the intracellular side. The polar/charged amino acids in the binding pocket are important in the transport process. They first \"fix\" the ribose and allow the uracil base of uridine to approach the entrance of the intracellular side, and then \"release\" the ribose to allow uridine to move freely into the intracellular side coupled with the movement of sodium ions and HP1b. Finally, we propose a detailed mechanism of the nucleoside transport from the binding pocket to the intracellular side of the vcCNT.",

        "title": "Theoretical Q1 Q2 studies on beta and delta isoform-specific binding mechanisms of phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors1",
        "abstract": "ositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is known to be closely related to tumorigenesis and cell proliferation, and controls a variety of cellular processes, including proliferation, growth, apoptosis, migration, metabolism, etc. The PI3K family comprises eight catalytic isoforms, which are subdivided into three classes. Recently, the discovery of inhibitors that block a single isoform of PI3K has continued to attract special attention because they may have higher selectivity for certain tumors and less toxicity for healthy cells. The PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ share fewer studies than α/γ, and therefore, in this work, the combination of molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations was employed to explore the binding of three isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors (COM8, IC87114, and GDC-0941) to PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ. The isoform specificities of the studied inhibitors derived from the predicted binding free energies are in good agreement with the experimental data. In addition, the key residues critical for PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ selectivity were highlighted by decomposing the binding free energies into the contributions from individual residues. It was observed that although PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ share the conserved ATP-binding pockets, individual residues do behave differently, particularly the residues critical for PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ selectivity. It can be concluded that the inhibitor specificity between PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ is determined by the additive contributions from multiple residues, not just a single one. This study provides valuable information for understanding the isoform-specific binding mechanisms of PI3K inhibitors, and should be useful for the rational design of novel and selective PI3K inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "inhibition of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) dramatically improved therapeutic outcomes in the treatment of ALK-positive cancers, but unfortunately patients invariably progressed due to acquired resistance mutations in ALK. Currently available drugs are all type-I inhibitors bound to the ATP-binding pocket and are most likely to be resistant in patients harboring genetic mutations surrounding the ATP pocket. To overcome drug resistance, we rationally designed a novel kind of “bridge” inhibitor, which specially bind into an extended hydrophobic back pocket adjacent to the ATP-binding site of ALK. The novel type-I1/2 inhibitors display excellent antiproliferation activity against ALK-positive cancer cells and appear superior to two clinically used drugs, crizotinib and ceritinib. Structural and molecular modeling analyses indicate that the inhibitor induces dramatic conformational transition and stabilizes unique DFG-shifted loop conformation, enabling persistent sensitivity to different genetic mutations in ALK. These data highlight a rationale for further development of next-generation ALK inhibitors to combat drug resistance.",

        "abstract": "The receptor tyrosine kinase Tie-2 is involved in vessel remodeling and maturation, and has been regarded as a potential target for the treatment of various solid tumors. The absence of novel, potent and selective inhibitors severely hampers the understanding of the therapeutic potential of Tie-2. In the present work, we describe the discovery of novel type-I inhibitors of Tie-2 by structure-based virtual screening. Preliminary SAR was also performed based on one active compound, and several novel inhibitors with low micro-molar affinity were discovered. To directly compare the efficiency between different filtering strategies in selecting VS candidates, two methods were separately carried out to screen the same chemical library, and the selected VS candidates were then experimentally assessed by in vitro enzymatic assays. The results demonstrate that the hit rate is improved when stricter drug-likeness criteria and less number of molecules for clustering analysis are used, and meanwhile, the molecular diversity of the compounds still maintains. As a case study of TIE-2, the information presented in this work underscores the importance of selecting an appropriate selection strategy in VS campaign, and the novel inhibitors identified and the detailed binding modes of action provide a starting point for further hit-to-lead optimization process.",

Recent approval of idelalisib, a specific inhibitor of PI3Kδ, for the treatment of several types of HM, is likely to attract more interest in search for novel PI3K inhibitors. Here, we discuss classic and cutting-edge techniques and strategies to identify PI3K inhibitors for the treatment of HM.
