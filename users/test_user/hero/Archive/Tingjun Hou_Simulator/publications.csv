To systematically evaluate the performance of these methods, we report here an extensive study of 59 ligands interacting with six different proteins. First, we explored the effects of the length of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, ranging from 400 to 4800 ps, and the solute dielectric constant (1, 2, or 4) on the binding free energies predicted by MM/PBSA. The following three important conclusions could be observed: (1) MD simulation length has an obvious impact on the predictions, and longer MD simulation is not always necessary to achieve better predictions. (2) The predictions are quite sensitive to the solute dielectric constant, and this parameter should be carefully determined according to the characteristics of the protein/ligand binding interface. (3) Conformational entropy often show large fluctuations in MD trajectories, and a large number of snapshots are necessary to achieve stable predictions. Next, we evaluated the accuracy of the binding free energies calculated by three Generalized Born (GB) models. We found that the GB model developed by Onufriev and Case was the most successful model in ranking the binding affinities of the studied inhibitors. Finally, we evaluated the performance of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA in predicting binding free energies.

Nowadays, as a variety of docking programs are available for the scientific community, a comprehensive understanding of the advantages and limitations of each docking program is fundamentally important to conduct more reasonable docking studies and docking-based virtual screening. In the present study, based on an extensive dataset of 2002 protein-ligand complexes from the PDBbind database (version 2014), the performance of ten docking programs, including five commercial programs (LigandFit, Glide, GOLD, MOE Dock, and Surflex-Dock) and five academic programs (AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, LeDock, rDock, and UCSF DOCK), was systematically evaluated by examining the accuracies of binding pose prediction (sampling power) and binding affinity estimation (scoring power). Our results showed that GOLD and LeDock had the best sampling power (GOLD: 59.8% accuracy for the top scored poses; LeDock: 80.8% accuracy for the best poses) and AutoDock Vina had the best scoring power (rp/rs of 0.564/0.580 and 0.569/0.584 for the top scored poses and best poses), suggesting that the commercial programs did not show the expected better performance than the academic ones. Overall, the ligand binding poses could be identified in most cases by the evaluated docking programs but the ranks of the binding affinities for the entire dataset could not be well predicted by most docking programs. However, for some types of protein families, relatively high linear correlations between docking scores and experimental binding affinities could be achieved.

Most scoring functions implemented in popular docking software packages were developed with many approximations for computational efficiency, which sacrifices the accuracy of prediction. With advanced technology and powerful computational hardware nowadays, it is feasible to use rigorous scoring functions, such as molecular mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) and molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) in molecular docking studies. Here, we systematically investigated the performance of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA to identify the correct binding conformations and predict the binding free energies for 98 protein-ligand complexes. Comparison studies showed that MM/GBSA (69.4%) outperformed MM/PBSA (45.5%) and many popular scoring functions to identify the correct binding conformations. Moreover, we found that molecular dynamics simulations are necessary for some systems to identify the correct binding conformations. Based on our results, we proposed the guideline for MM/GBSA to predict the binding conformations. We then tested the performance of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA to reproduce the binding free energies of the 98 protein-ligand complexes. The best prediction of MM/GBSA model with internal dielectric constant 2.0, produced a Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.66, which is better than MM/PBSA (0.49) and almost all scoring functions used in molecular docking.

The results can be summarized as follows: (1) for the one-protein-family/one-binding-ligand case which represents the unbiased protein-ligand complex sampling, both MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA methodologies achieve approximately equal accuracies at the interior dielectric constant of 4 (with rp = 0.408 ± 0.006 of MM/GBSA and rp = 0.388 ± 0.006 of MM/PBSA based on the minimized structures); while for the total dataset (1864 crystal structures), the overall best Pearson correlation coefficient (rp = 0.579 ± 0.002) based on MM/GBSA is better than that of MM/PBSA (rp = 0.491 ± 0.003), indicating that biased sampling may significantly affect the accuracy of the predicted result (some protein families contain too many instances and can bias the overall predicted accuracy). Therefore, family based classification is needed to evaluate the two methodologies; (2) the prediction accuracies of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA for different protein families are quite different with rp ranging from 0 to 0.9, whereas the correlation and ranking scores (an averaged rp/rs over a list of protein folds and also representing the unbiased sampling) given by MM/PBSA (rp-score = 0.506 ± 0.050 and rs-score = 0.481 ± 0.052) are comparable to those given by MM/GBSA (rp-score = 0.516 ± 0.047 and rs-score = 0.463 ± 0.047) at the fold family level; (3) for the overall prediction accuracies, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation may not be quite necessary for MM/GBSA (rp-minimized = 0.579 ± 0.002 and rp-1ns = 0.564 ± 0.002), but is needed for MM/PBSA (rp-minimized = 0.412 ± 0.003 and rp-1ns = 0.491 ± 0.003). However, for the individual systems, whether to use MD simulation is depended. (4) both MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA may be unable to give successful predictions for the ligands with high formal charges, with the Pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0.621 ± 0.003 (neutral ligands) to 0.125 ± 0.142 (ligands with a formal charge of 5). Therefore, it can be summarized that, although MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA perform similarly in the unbiased dataset, for the currently available crystal structures in the PDBbind database, compared with MM/GBSA, which may be used in multi-target comparisons, MM/PBSA is more sensitive to the investigated systems, and may be more suitable for individual-target-level binding free energy ranking.

In terms of computational cost, XGBoost and RF are the two most efficient algorithms and only need a few seconds to train a model even for a large dataset. The model interpretations by the SHAP method can effectively explore the established domain knowledge for the descriptor-based models. Finally, we explored use of these models for virtual screening (VS) towards HIV and demonstrated that different ML algorithms offer diverse VS profiles.

Protein-protein docking can afford the atomic structural details of protein-protein complexes, but the accurate prediction of the three-dimensional structures for protein-protein systems is still notoriously difficult due in part to the lack of an ideal scoring function for protein-protein docking. Compared with most scoring functions used in protein-protein docking, the Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) and Molecular Mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) methodologies are more theoretically rigorous, but their overall performance for the predictions of binding affinities and binding poses for protein-protein systems has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we first evaluated the performance of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA to predict the binding affinities for 46 protein-protein complexes. On the whole, different force fields, solvation models, and interior dielectric constants have obvious impacts on the prediction accuracy of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA. The MM/GBSA calculations based on the ff02 force field, the GB model developed by Onufriev et al. and a low interior dielectric constant (εin = 1) yield the best correlation between the predicted binding affinities and the experimental data (rp = -0.647), which is better than MM/PBSA (rp = -0.523) and a number of empirical scoring functions used in protein-protein docking (rp = -0.141 to -0.529). Then, we examined the capability of MM/GBSA to identify the possible near-native binding structures from the decoys generated by ZDOCK for 43 protein-protein systems. The results illustrate that the MM/GBSA rescoring has better capability to distinguish the correct binding structures from the decoys than the ZDOCK scoring. Besides, the optimal interior dielectric constant of MM/GBSA for re-ranking docking poses may be determined by analyzing the characteristics of protein-protein binding interfaces.

Here, we systematically investigated entropy effects on the prediction power of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA using >1500 protein-ligand systems and six representative AMBER force fields. Two computationally efficient methods, including NMA based on truncated structures and the interaction entropy approach, were used to estimate the entropic contributions to ligand-target binding free energies. In terms of the overall accuracy, we found that, for the minimized structures, in most cases the inclusion of the conformational entropies predicted by truncated NMA (enthalpynmode_min_9Å) compromises the overall accuracy of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA compared with the enthalpies calculated based on the minimized structures (enthalpymin). However, for the MD trajectories, the binding free energies can be improved by the inclusion of the conformation entropies predicted by either truncated-NMA for a relatively high dielectric constant (εin = 4) or the interaction entropy method for εin = 1-4. In terms of reproducing the absolute binding free energies, the binding free energies estimated by including the truncated-NMA entropies based on the MD trajectories (ΔGnmode_md_9Å) give the lowest average absolute deviations against the experimental data among all the tested strategies for both MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA. Although the inclusion of the truncated NMA based on the MD trajectories (ΔGnmode_md_9Å) for a relatively high dielectric constant gave the overall best result and the lowest average absolute deviations against the experimental data (for the ff03 force field), it needs too much computational time. Alternatively, considering that the interaction entropy method does not incur any additional computational cost and can give comparable (at high dielectric constant, εin = 4) or even better (at low dielectric constant, εin = 1-2) results than the truncated-NMA entropy (ΔGnmode_md_9Å), the interaction entropy approach is recommended to estimate the entropic component for MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA based on MD trajectories, especially for a diverse dataset. Furthermore, we compared the predictions of MM/GBSA with six different AMBER force fields.

The correlation analysis between the intestinal absorption and several important molecular properties demonstrated that no single molecular property could be used as a good discriminator to efficiently distinguish the poorly absorbed compounds from those that are well absorbed. The theoretical correlation models for a training set of 455 compounds were proposed by using the genetic function approximation technique. The best prediction model contains four molecular descriptors: topological polar surface area, the predicted distribution coefficient at pH = 6.5, the number of violations of the Lipinski's rule-of-five, and the square of the number of hydrogen-bond donors. The model was able to predict the fractional absorption with an r = 0.84 and a prediction error (absolute mean error) of 11.2% for the training set. Moreover, it achieves an r = 0.90 and a prediction error of 7.8% for a 98-compound test set. The recursive partitioning technique was applied to find the simple hierarchical rules to classify the compounds into poor (%FA < or = 30%) and good (%FA > 30%) intestinal absorption classes.

A training set of 77 structurally diverse organic molecules was used to construct significant QSAR models for Caco-2 cell permeation. Cellular permeation was found to depend primarily upon experimental distribution coefficient (logD) at pH = 7.4, high charged polar surface area (HCPSA), and radius of gyration (rgyr). Among these three descriptors, logD may have the largest impact on diffusion through Caco-2 cell because logD shows obvious linear correlation with logPapp (r=0.703) when logD is smaller than 2.0. High polar surface area will be unfavorable to achieve good Caco-2 permeability because higher polar surface area will introduce stronger H-bonding interactions between Caco-2 cells and drugs. The comparison among HCPSA, PSA (polar surface area), and TPSA (topological polar surface area) implies that high-charged atoms may be more important to the interactions between Caco-2 cell and drugs. Besides logD and HCPSA, rgyr is also closely connected with Caco-2 permeabilities. The molecules with larger rgyr are more difficult to cross Caco-2 monolayers than those with smaller rgyr. The descriptors included in the prediction models permit the interpretation in structural terms of the passive permeability process, evidencing the main role of lipholiphicity, H-bonding, and bulk properties. Besides these three molecular descriptors, the influence of other molecular descriptors was also investigated. From the calculated results, it can be found that introducing descriptors concerned with molecular flexibility can improve the linear correlation. The resulting model with four descriptors bears good statistical significance, n = 77, r = 0.82, q = 0.79, s = 0.45, F = 35.7. The actual predictive abilities of the QSAR model were validated through an external validation test set of 23 diverse compounds. The predictions for the tested compounds are as the same accuracy as the compounds of the training set and significantly better than those predicted by using the model reported.

The use of smart computational methods in the life cycle of drug design is relatively a recent development that has gained much popularity and interest over the last few years. Central to this methodology is the notion of computational docking which is the process of predicting the best pose (orientation + conformation) of a small molecule (drug candidate) when bound to a target larger receptor molecule (protein) in order to form a stable complex molecule. In computational docking, a large number of binding poses are evaluated and ranked using a scoring function. The scoring function is a mathematical predictive model that produces a score that represents the binding free energy, and hence the stability, of the resulting complex molecule. Generally, such a function should produce a set of plausible ligands ranked according to their binding stability along with their binding poses. In more practical terms, an effective scoring function should produce promising drug candidates which can then be synthesized and physically screened using high throughput screening process. Therefore, the key to computer-aided drug design is the design of an efficient highly accurate scoring function (using ML techniques).",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9a297e83ca2bf1b3af089e51d85e927544ddfe04,It is believed that the continuous improvement in ML‐based SFs can surely guide the early‐stage drug design and accelerate the discovery of new drugs.,MA.

Characterizing the interaction interface of domain-peptide complexes and predicting binding specificity for modular domains are critical for deciphering protein-protein interaction networks. Here, we propose the use of an energetic decomposition analysis to characterize domain-peptide interactions and the molecular interaction energy components (MIECs), including van der Waals, electrostatic, and desolvation energy between residue pairs on the binding interface. We show a proof-of-concept study on the amphiphysin-1 SH3 domain interacting with its peptide ligands. The structures of the human amphiphysin-1 SH3 domain complexed with 884 peptides were first modeled using virtual mutagenesis and optimized by molecular mechanics (MM) minimization. Next, the MIECs between domain and peptide residues were computed using the MM/generalized Born decomposition analysis. We conducted two types of statistical analyses on the MIECs to demonstrate their usefulness for predicting binding affinities of peptides and for classifying peptides into binder and non-binder categories. First, combining partial least squares analysis and genetic algorithm, we fitted linear regression models between the MIECs and the peptide binding affinities on the training data set. These models were then used to predict binding affinities for peptides in the test data set; the predicted values have a correlation coefficient of 0.81 and an unsigned mean error of 0.39 compared with the experimentally measured ones. The partial least squares-genetic algorithm analysis on the MIECs revealed the critical interactions for the binding specificity of the amphiphysin-1 SH3 domain. Next, a support vector machine (SVM) was employed to build classification models based on the MIECs of peptides in the training set. A rigorous training-validation procedure was used to assess the performances of different kernel functions in SVM and different combinations of the MIECs. The best SVM classifier gave satisfactory predictions for the test set, indicated by average prediction accuracy rates of 78% and 91% for the binding and non-binding peptides, respectively. We also showed that the performance of our approach on both binding affinity prediction and binder/non-binder classification was superior to the performances of the conventional MM/Poisson-Boltzmann solvent-accessible surface area and MM/generalized Born solvent-accessible surface area calculations.

First of all, the diffusion coefficients of organic solutes in aqueous solution can be well predicted: the average unsigned errors and the root mean square errors are 0.137 and 0.171 × 10(-5) cm(-2) s(-1), respectively. Second, although the absolute values of D cannot be predicted, good correlations have been achieved for eight organic solvents with experimental data (R(2) = 0.784), four proteins in aqueous solutions (R(2) = 0.996), and nine organic compounds in nonaqueous solutions (R(2) = 0.834). The temperature dependent behaviors of three solvents, namely, TIP3P water, dimethyl sulfoxide, and cyclohexane have been studied. The major molecular dynamics (MD) settings, such as the sizes of simulation boxes and with/without wrapping the coordinates of MD snapshots into the primary simulation boxes have been explored. We have concluded that our sampling strategy that averaging the mean square displacement collected in multiple short-MD simulations is efficient in predicting diffusion coefficients of solutes at infinite dilution.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc6aa5f5e0ab424fe4ea7600025adaa76cd4c987,It is concluded that the sampling strategy that averaging the mean square displacement collected in multiple short‐MD simulations is efficient in predicting diffusion coefficients of solutes at infinite dilution.,J.

It is important but challenging to determine the binding specificity of these domains accurately and to predict their physiological interacting partners. In this study, the interactions between 35 peptide ligands (15 binders and 20 non-binders) and the Abl SH3 domain were analyzed using molecular dynamics simulation and the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Solvent Area method. The calculated binding free energies correlated well with the rank order of the binding peptides and clearly distinguished binders from non-binders. Free energy component analysis revealed that the van der Waals interactions dictate the binding strength of peptides, whereas the binding specificity is determined by the electrostatic interaction and the polar contribution of desolvation. The binding motif of the Abl SH3 domain was then determined by a virtual mutagenesis method, which mutates the residue at each position of the template peptide relative to all other 19 amino acids and calculates the binding free energy difference between the template and the mutated peptides using the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Solvent Area method. A single position mutation free energy profile was thus established and used as a scoring matrix to search peptides recognized by the Abl SH3 domain in the human genome. Our approach successfully picked ten out of 13 experimentally determined binding partners of the Abl SH3 domain among the top 600 candidates from the 218,540 decapeptides with the PXXP motif in the SWISS-PROT database.

The best model is based on three descriptors: n-octanol/water partition coefficient calculated using the SLOGP approach, logP; high-charged polar surface areas based on the Gasteiger partial charges, HCPSA, and the excessive molecular weight larger than 360, MW(360). The model bears good statistical significance, n = 78, r = 0.88, q = 0.86, s = 0.36, F = 81.5. The actual prediction potential of the model was validated through two external validation sets of 37 diverse compounds. The predicted results demonstrate that the model bears better prediction potential than many other models and can be used for logBB estimations for drug and drug-like molecules. Comparison of several logP calculation approaches suggests that logP calculated by SLOGP can be used as a significant descriptor for the prediction of molecular transport properties because SLOGP gives the most similar results with CLOGP. The QSPR model indicates that larger polar surface areas have a more negative contribution to logBB, but the absolute partial charges on the atoms surrounded by the polar surfaces should be larger than 0.10|e|. Meanwhile, tight junction membranes limit the size of hydrophilic molecules that can cross the membrane with a molecular weight of approximately 360, because when a molecule's weight is larger than 360 it shows a negative contribution to logBB. The computations of molecular surface, partial charges, logP, and logBB have been accomplished using a program called Drug-BB. Moreover, to improve the efficiency of the computations of logP, we made an extensive reparametrization of SLOGP, and the newly developed SLOGP model is only based on simple atomic addition. Further, we developed a set of parameters to calculate the topological polar surface area (TPSA), thus the high-charged topological polar surface area (HCTPSA) could be estimated from the 2D connection information of a molecule. Adopting the new strategies, the estimations of logP, HCTPSA, and logBB are only based on the topological structure of a molecule and therefore, can be used for fast screening of virtual libraries having millions of molecules.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bba85b5c99eb726141920857ccedab852d9fecb9,Comparison of several logP calculation approaches suggests that logP calculated bySLOGP can be used as a significant descriptor for the prediction of molecular transport properties because SLOGP gives the most similar results with CLOGP.,TJ.

For comparison, we also rederived the parameters for three Thole models in which the 1-2 (bonded), 1-3 (separated by two bonds), and 1-4 (separated by three bonds) interactions are fully included.

They are complementary to experiment and can often go beyond experiment in atomic details. Even a FF is specific for studying structures, dynamics and functions of biomolecules, it is still important for the FF to accurately reproduce the experimental liquid properties of small molecules that represent the chemical moieties of biomolecules. Otherwise, the force field may not describe the structures and energies of macromolecules in aqueous solutions properly. In this work, we have carried out a systematic study to evaluate the General AMBER Force Field (GAFF) in studying densities and heats of vaporization for a large set of organic molecules that covers the most common chemical functional groups. The latest techniques, such as the particle mesh Ewald (PME) for calculating electrostatic energies, and Langevin dynamics for scaling temperatures, have been applied in the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For density, the average percent error (APE) of 71 organic compounds is 4.43% when compared to the experimental values. More encouragingly, the APE drops to 3.43% after the exclusion of two outliers and four other compounds for which the experimental densities have been measured with pressures higher than 1.0 atm. For heat of vaporization, several protocols have been investigated and the best one, P4/ntt0, achieves an average unsigned error (AUE) and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.93 and 1.20 kcal/mol, respectively. How to reduce the prediction errors through proper van der Waals (vdW) parameterization has been discussed. An encouraging finding in vdW parameterization is that both densities and heats of vaporization approach their ""ideal"" values in a synchronous fashion when vdW parameters are tuned. The following hydration free energy calculation using thermodynamic integration further justifies the vdW refinement. We conclude that simple vdW parameterization can significantly reduce the prediction errors.

Ten SVM classification models have been generated to investigate the impact of different individual molecular properties on %FA. Among these studied important molecule descriptors, topological polar surface area (TPSA) and predicted apparent octanol-water distribution coefficient at pH 6.5 (logD6.5) show better classification performance than the others. To obtain the best SVM classifier, the influences of different kernel functions and different combinations of molecular descriptors were investigated using a rigorous training-validation procedure. The best SVM classifier can give satisfactory predictions for the training set (97.8% for the poor-absorption class and 94.5% for the good-absorption class). Moreover, 100% of the poor-absorption class and 97.8% of the good-absorption class in the external test set could be correctly classified. Finally, the influence of the size of the training set and the unbalanced nature of the data set have been studied. The analysis demonstrates that large data set is necessary for the stability of the classification models. Furthermore, the weights for the poor-absorption class and the good-absorption class should be properly balanced to generate unbiased classification models. Our work illustrates that SVMs used in combination with simple molecular descriptors can provide an extremely reliable assessment of intestinal absorption in an early in silico filtering process.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96ac5d74840e887b81e8d7e4700b77181a35e07b,This work illustrates that SVMs used in combination with simple molecular descriptors can provide an extremely reliable assessment of intestinal absorption in an early in silico filtering process.,T.

It is related to absorption and distribution in the ADME-Tox (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity). Aqueous solubility and membrane permeability are the two key factors that affect a drug's oral bioavailability. Because of the importance of aqueous solubility, a lot of efforts have been spent on developing reliable models to predict this physiochemical property. Although some progress has been made and a lot of models have been constructed, it is concluded that accurate and reliable aqueous models targeted to predict solubility of drug-like molecules, have not emerged based on the outcome of an aqueous solubility prediction campaign sponsored by Goodman et al. In this review paper, we provide a snapshot of the latest development in the field. The challenges of developing high quality aqueous solubility models as well as the strategies of surmounting those challenges have been discussed. We conclude that the biggest challenge of modeling aqueous solubility is to collect more high quality, unskewed and drug-relevant solubility data which are sufficient diverse to cover most the chemical space of drugs. The second challenge is to develop good descriptors to account for the lattice energy of solvation. In order to develop accurate and predictable in silico solubility models, the key is to collect a sufficient number of high quality experimental data and the suspicious data must be verified. In addition, the molecular descriptors must be relevant to the energies in the solvation process (the lattice energy for crystal packing, the energy of forming cavity in solvent, and the solvation energy), and the models must be carefully cross-validated and evaluated using the external data sets.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed5f0e5d592a6e65262c5b604215f9f2ea7d956f,"The biggest challenge of modeling aqueous solubility is to collect more high quality, unskewed and drug-relevantsolubility data which are sufficient diverse to cover most the chemical space of drugs.",J.

Recently, the most stable surface structures of CH3NH3PbX3 have been successfully characterized by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with the high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results. The two coexisting phases of the perovskite surfaces have been ascribed to the alternate orientation of the methylammonium (MA) cations. Notably, similar surface defect images (a dark depression at the sites of X atoms) have been observed on surfaces produced with various experimental methods. As such, these defects are expected to be intrinsic to the perovskite crystals and may play an important role in the structural decomposition of perovskite materials. Understanding the nature of such defects should provide some useful information toward understanding the instability of perovskite materials. Thus, we investigate the chemical identity of the surface defects systematically with first-principles density functional theory calculations and STM simulations. The calculated STM images of the Br and Br-MA vacancies are both in good agreement with the experimental measurements. In vacuum conditions, the formation energy of Br-MA is 0.43 eV less than the Br vacancy. In the presence of solvation effects, however, the formation energy of a Br vacancy becomes 0.42 eV lower than the Br-MA vacancy. In addition, at the vacancy sites, the adsorption energies of water, oxygen, and acetonitrile molecules are significantly higher than those on the pristine surfaces. This clearly demonstrated that the structural decomposition of perovskites are much easier to start from these vacancy sites than the pristine surfaces.

For comparison, we study the catalytic activity of the single B-doped graphene nanoribbon (S-BGNR) and B-doped graphene (BG) for ORR. Remarkably, the para-B distribution on BGNR leads to high affinity for O2 adsorption and excellent catalytic activity, which is superior to S-BGNR and BG.

Accurate prediction of binding free energy is of particular importance to computational biology and structure-based drug design. Among those methods for binding affinity predictions, the end-point approaches, such as MM/PBSA and LIE, have been widely used because they can achieve a good balance between prediction accuracy and computational cost. Here we present an easy-to-use pipeline tool named Calculation of Free Energy (CaFE) to conduct MM/PBSA and LIE calculations. Powered by the VMD and NAMD programs, CaFE is able to handle numerous static coordinate and molecular dynamics trajectory file formats generated by different molecular simulation packages and supports various force field parameters.

MM-PBSA (molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area) and MM-GBSA (molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area) have gained popularity in this field. For both methods, the conformational entropy, which is usually calculated through normal-mode analysis (NMA), is needed to calculate the absolute binding free energies. Unfortunately, NMA is computationally demanding and becomes a bottleneck of the MM-PB/GBSA-NMA methods. In this work, we have developed a fast approach to estimate the conformational entropy based upon solvent accessible surface area calculations. In our approach, the conformational entropy of a molecule, S, can be obtained by summing up the contributions of all atoms, no matter they are buried or exposed. Each atom has two types of surface areas, solvent accessible surface area (SAS) and buried SAS (BSAS). The two types of surface areas are weighted to estimate the contribution of an atom to S. Atoms having the same atom type share the same weight and a general parameter k is applied to balance the contributions of the two types of surface areas. This entropy model was parametrized using a large set of small molecules for which their conformational entropies were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level taking the solvent effect into account. The weighted solvent accessible surface area (WSAS) model was extensively evaluated in three tests. For convenience, TS values, the product of temperature T and conformational entropy S, were calculated in those tests. T was always set to 298.15 K through the text. First of all, good correlations were achieved between WSAS TS and NMA TS for 44 protein or nucleic acid systems sampled with molecular dynamics simulations (10 snapshots were collected for postentropy calculations): the mean correlation coefficient squares (R²) was 0.56. As to the 20 complexes, the TS changes upon binding; TΔS values were also calculated, and the mean R² was 0.67 between NMA and WSAS. In the second test, TS values were calculated for 12 proteins decoy sets (each set has 31 conformations) generated by the Rosetta software package. Again, good correlations were achieved for all decoy sets: the mean, maximum, and minimum of R² were 0.73, 0.89, and 0.55, respectively. Finally, binding free energies were calculated for 6 protein systems (the numbers of inhibitors range from 4 to 18) using four scoring functions. Compared to the measured binding free energies, the mean R² of the six protein systems were 0.51, 0.47, 0.40, and 0.43 for MM-GBSA-WSAS, MM-GBSA-NMA, MM-PBSA-WSAS, and MM-PBSA-NMA, respectively. The mean rms errors of prediction were 1.19, 1.24, 1.41, 1.29 kcal/mol for the four scoring functions, correspondingly. Therefore, the two scoring functions employing WSAS achieved a comparable prediction performance to that of the scoring functions using NMA. It should be emphasized that no minimization was performed prior to the WSAS calculation in the last test. Although WSAS is not as rigorous as physical models such as quasi-harmonic analysis and thermodynamic integration (TI), it is computationally very efficient as only surface area calculation is involved and no structural minimization is required. Moreover, WSAS has achieved a comparable performance to normal-mode analysis. We expect that this model could find its applications in the fields like high throughput screening (HTS), molecular docking, and rational protein design. In those fields, efficiency is crucial since there are a large number of compounds, docking poses, or protein models to be evaluated.

It is highly associated with the ADMET properties of drugs and drug candidates and, moreover, plays a major role in the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenomenon, which leads to the failure of chemotherapy in cancer treatments. Therefore, the recognition of potential P-gp substrates at the early stages of the drug discovery process is quite important. Here, we compiled an extensive data set containing 423 P-gp substrates and 399 nonsubstrates, which is the largest P-gp substrate/nonsubstrate data set yet published. Comparison of the distributions of eight important physicochemical properties for the substrates and nonsubstrates reveals that molecular weight and molecular solubility are the informative attributes differentiating P-gp substrates from nonsubstrates. Examination of the distributions of eight physicochemical properties for 735 P-gp inhibitors and 423 substrates gives the fact that inhibitors are significantly more hydrophobic than substrates while substrates tend to have more H-bond donors than inhibitors. Then, the classification models based on simple molecular properties, topological descriptors, and molecular fingerprints were developed using the naive Bayesian classification technique. The best naive Bayesian classifier yields a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.824 and a prediction accuracy of 91.2% for the training set from a 5-fold cross-validation procedure, and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.667 and a prediction accuracy of 83.5% for the test set containing 200 molecules. Analysis of the important structural fragments given by the Bayesian classifier shows that the essential H-bond acceptors arranged in distinct spatial patterns and flexibility are quite essential for P-gp substrate-likeness, which affords a deeper understanding on the molecular basis of substrate/P-gp interaction.

Treatment strategies for SCI are required to overcome comprehensive issues. Implantation of biomaterial scaffolds and stem cells has been demonstrated to be a promising strategy. However, a comprehensive recovery effect is difficult to achieve. In the comprehensive treatment process, the specific roles of the implanted scaffolds and of stem cells in combined strategy are usually neglected. In this study, a peptide-modified scaffold is developed based on hyaluronic acid and an adhesive peptide PPFLMLLKGSTR. Synchrotron radiation micro computed tomography measurement provides insights to the three-dimensional inner topographical property and perspective porous structure of the scaffold. The modified scaffold significantly improves cellular survival and adhesive growth of mesenchymal stem cells during 3D culture in vitro. After implantation in transected spinal cord, the modified scaffold and mesenchymal stems are found to function in synergy to restore injured spinal cord tissue, with respective strengths. Hindlimb motor function scores exhibit the most significant impact of the composite implant at 2 weeks post injury, which is the time secondary injury factors begin to take hold. Investigation on the secondary injury factors including inflammatory response and astrocyte overactivity at 10 days post injury reveals the possible underlying reason. Implants of the scaffold, cells, and especially the combination of both elicit inhibitory effects on these adverse factors.

For this purpose, the theoretical models for drug-likeness to discriminate between drug-like and non-drug-like based on molecular physicochemical properties and structural fingerprints were developed by using the naive Bayesian classification (NBC) and recursive partitioning (RP) techniques, and then the drug-likeness of the compounds from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Compound Database (TCMCD) was evaluated. First, the impact of molecular physicochemical properties and structural fingerprints on the prediction accuracy of drug-likeness was examined. We found that, compared with simple molecular properties, structural fingerprints were more essential for the accurate prediction of drug-likeness. Then, a variety of Bayesian classifiers were constructed by changing the ratio of drug-like to non-drug-like molecules and the size of the training set. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy of the Bayesian classifiers was closely related to the size and the degree of the balance of the training set. When a balanced training set was used, the best Bayesian classifier based on 21 physicochemical properties and the LCFP_6 fingerprint set yielded an overall leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validated accuracy of 91.4% for the 140,000 molecules in the training set and 90.9% for the 40,000 molecules in the test set. In addition, the RP classifiers with different maximum depth were constructed and compared with the Bayesian classifiers, and we found that the best Bayesian classifier outperformed the best RP model with respect to overall prediction accuracy. Moreover, the Bayesian classifier employing structural fingerprints highlights the important substructures favorable or unfavorable for drug-likeness, offering extra valuable information for getting high quality lead compounds in the early stage of the drug design/discovery process. Finally, the best Bayesian classifier was used to predict the drug-likeness of 33,961 compounds in TCMCD. Our calculations show that 59.37% of the molecules in TCMCD were identified as drug-like molecules, indicating that traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) are therefore an excellent source of drug-like molecules. Furthermore, the important structural fingerprints in TCMCD were detected and analyzed.

These compounds belonging to six different structural classes were randomly divided into a training set of 122 compounds and a test set of 13 compounds. The statistical results showed that the 3D-QSAR models derived from CoMFA were superior to those generated from CoMSIA. The most optimal CoMFA model after region focusing bears significant cross-validated r(2)(cv) of 0.60 and conventional r(2) of 0.92. The predictive power of the best CoMFA model was further validated by the accurate estimation to these compounds in the external test set, and the mean agreement of experimental and predicted log(IC(50)) values of the inhibitors is 0.6 log unit. Separate CoMFA models were conducted to evaluate the influence of different partial charges (Gasteiger-Marsili, Gasteiger-Hückel, MMFF94, ESP-AM1, and MPA-AM1) on the statistical quality of the models. The resulting CoMFA field map provides information on the geometry of the binding site cavity and the relative weights of various properties in different site pockets for each of the substrates considered.

In this study, three ensemble learning methods, including random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and two deep learning methods, including deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), were used to develop classification models to discriminate inhibitors and non-inhibitors for five major CYP450 isoforms (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4).

Computational approaches, especially molecular docking, provide an efficient way to model PpIs, and a reliable scoring function that can recognize the correct binding conformations for protein-peptide complexes is one of the most important components in protein-peptide docking. The end-point binding free energy calculation methods, such as MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA, are theoretically more rigorous than most empirical and semi-empirical scoring functions designed for protein-peptide docking, but their performance in predicting binding affinities and binding poses for protein-peptide systems has not been systematically assessed. In this study, we first evaluated the capability of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA with different solvation models, interior dielectric constants (εin) and force fields to predict the binding affinities for 53 protein-peptide complexes. For the 19 short peptides with 5-12 residues, MM/PBSA based on the minimized structures in explicit solvent with the ff99 force field and εin = 2 yields the best correlation between the predicted binding affinities and the experimental data (rp = 0.748), while for the 34 medium-size peptides with 20-25 residues, MM/GBSA based on 1 ns of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in implicit solvent with the ff03 force field, the GBOBC1 model and a low interior dielectric constant (εin = 1) yields the best accuracy (rp = 0.735).

In our docking procedure, surface complementarity and energetic complementarity of a ligand with its receptor have been considered separately in a two-stage docking method. The first stage was to find a set of potential associated sites mainly based on surface complementarity using a genetic algorithm combined with a tabu search. This step corresponds with the process of finding the potential binding sites where pharmacophores will bind. In the second stage, several hundreds of GA minimization steps were performed for each associated site derived from the first stage mainly based on the energetic complementarity. After calculations for both of the two stages, we can offer several solutions of associated sites for every complex. In this paper, seven biomolecular systems, including five bound complexes and two unbound complexes, were chosen from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to test our method. The calculated results were very encouraging-the hybrid minimization algorithm successfully reaches the correct solutions near the best binded modes for these protein complexes. The docking results not only predict the bound complexes very well, but also get a relatively accurate complexed conformation for unbound systems. For the five bound complexes, the results show that surface complementarity is enough to find the precise binding modes, the top solution from the tabu list generally corresponds to the correct binding mode. For the two unbound complexes, due to the conformational changes upon binding, it seems more difficult to get their correct binding conformations. The predicted results show that the correct binding mode also corresponds to a relatively large surface complementarity score. In these two test cases, the correct solution can be found in the top several solutions from the tabu list. For unbound complexes, the interaction energy from energetic complementarity is very important, it can be used to filter these solutions from the surface complementarity. After the evaluation of the energetic complementarity, the conformations and orientations close to the crystallographically determined structures are resolved. In most cases, the smallest root mean square distance (r.m.s.d.) from the GA combined with TA solutions is in a relatively small region.

However, under strong purifying selection, drug resistance usually occurs in the cancer cells within a short term. Many cases of drug resistance have been found to be associated with secondary mutations in drug target, which lead to the attenuated drug-target interactions. For example, recently, an acquired secondary mutation, G2032R, has been detected in the drug target, ROS1 tyrosine kinase, from a crizotinib-resistant patient, who responded poorly to crizotinib within a very short therapeutic term. It was supposed that the mutation was located at the solvent front and might hinder the drug binding. However, a different fact could be uncovered by the simulations reported in this study. Here, free energy surfaces were characterized by the drug-target distance and the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) conformational change of the crizotinib-ROS1 complex through advanced molecular dynamics techniques, and it was revealed that the more rigid P-loop region in the G2032R-mutated ROS1 was primarily responsible for the crizotinib resistance, which on one hand, impaired the binding of crizotinib directly, and on the other hand, shortened the residence time induced by the flattened free energy surface.

Therefore, in this study, the adaptive biasing force (ABF) method and two-end-state free energy calculation approaches were employed to elucidate the resistance mechanisms of crizotinib induced by the mutations L1152R, G1202R, and S1206Y. The ABF simulation results suggest that the reaction coordinates for the unbinding processes of crizotinib from the binding pockets of the mutated ALKs is different from that of the wild type ALK. The potentials of mean force for the crizotinib unbinding and the binding free energies predicted by the two-end-state free energy calculations are consistent with the experimental data. Our results indicate that the three mutations weaken the binding affinity of crizotinib obviously and lead to drug resistance. The free energy decomposition analysis illustrates the importance of the loss of two important H-bonds in the L1152R and S1206Y mutants on drug resistance.

We analyzed the energetic pattern of the protease-drug interaction by calculating the molecular interaction energy components (MIECs) between the drug and the protease residues. Support vector machines (SVMs) were trained on MIECs to classify protease mutants into resistant and nonresistant categories. The high prediction accuracies for the test sets of cross-validations suggested that the MIECs successfully characterized the interaction interface between drugs and the HIV-1 protease. We conducted a proof-of-concept study on a newly approved drug, darunavir (TMC114), on which no drug resistance data were available in the public domain. Compared with amprenavir, our analysis suggested that darunavir might be more potent to combat drug resistance. To quantitatively estimate binding affinities of drugs and study the contributions of protease residues to causing resistance, linear regression models were trained on MIECs using partial least squares (PLS). The MIEC-PLS models also achieved satisfactory prediction accuracy. Analysis of the fitting coefficients of MIECs in the regression model revealed the important resistance mutations and shed light into understanding the mechanisms of these mutations to cause resistance.

Such anisotropic stability dependence is ascribed to the large scale delocalization of π electrons along the boron rows. In particular, all line-edge borophene nanoribbons undergo edge reconstructions, in which the out-of-plane bulking edge atoms are reconstructed to form quasi planar edge structures.

First, three docking protocols, rigid receptor docking, induced fit docking, QM-polarized ligand docking, were used to determine the binding modes of the studied inhibitors in the active site of ROCK1. The results illustrate that rigid receptor docking achieves the best performance to rank the binding affinities of the studied inhibitors. Then, based on the predicted structures from molecular docking, MD simulations and MM/GBSA free energy calculations were employed to determine the dynamic binding process and compare the binding modes of the inhibitors with different activities. The binding free energies predicted by MM/GBSA are in good agreement with the experimental bioactivities, and the analysis of the individual energy terms suggests that the van der Waals interaction is the major driving force for ligand binding.

Here we use Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) to determine 3D morphology of BHJ solar cells and show DPD to be an efficient approach to predict the 3D morphology. Based on the 3D morphology, we estimate the performance indicator of BHJ solar cells by using graph theory. Specifically, we study poly (3-hexylthiophene)/[6, 6]-phenyl-C61butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT/PCBM) BHJ solar cells. We find that, when the volume fraction of PCBM is in the region 0.4 ∼ 0.5, P3HT/PCBM will show bi-continuous morphology and optimum performance, consistent with experimental results.

It is more likely that drug-resistant influenza strains will arise after the extensive use of anti-influenza drugs. Consequently, the identification of the potential resistant sites for drugs in advance and the understanding of the corresponding molecular mechanisms that cause drug resistance are quite important in the design of new drug candidates with better potency to combat drug resistance. Here, we performed molecular simulations to evaluate the potency of oseltamivir to combat drug resistance caused by the mutations in 2009 A/H1N1 neuraminidase (NA). We examined three representative drug-resistant mutations in NA, consisting of H274Y, N294S, and Y252H. First, a theoretical structure of A/H1N1 NA in complex with oseltamivir was constructed using homology modeling. Then, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculations, and MM/GBSA free energy decomposition were used to characterize the binding of oseltamivir with the wild type (WT) and three mutated NAs. Our predictions show that N294S and H274Y, two popular drug-resistant mutations in different variants of NA, still cause significant resistance to oseltamivir. However, the Y252H mutation does not impair the interactions between oseltamivir and A/H1N1 NA. An examination of individual energy components shows that the loss of polar interactions is the key source for the resistance of the studied mutations to oseltamivir. Moreover, free energy decomposition analysis and structural analysis reveal that the N294S or H274Y mutation triggers the large-scale conformational changes of the binding pocket and then impairs the affinity of oseltamivir.

Meanwhile, it is a common and traditional issue in occupational and environmental protection. Pharmaceutical and chemical industries have a strong urge to develop precise and convenient computational tools to evaluate the respiratory toxicity of compounds as early as possible. Most of the reported theoretical models were developed based on the respiratory toxicity data sets with one single symptom, such as respiratory sensitization, and therefore these models may not afford reliable predictions for toxic compounds with other respiratory symptoms, such as pneumonia or rhinitis. Here, based on a diverse data set of mouse intraperitoneal respiratory toxicity characterized by multiple symptoms, a number of quantitative and qualitative predictions models with high reliability were developed by machine learning approaches. First, a four-tier dimension reduction strategy was employed to find an optimal set of 20 molecular descriptors for model building. Then, six machine learning approaches were used to develop the prediction models, including relevance vector machine (RVM), support vector machine (SVM), regularized random forest (RRF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), naïve Bayes (NB), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Among all of the models, the SVM regression model shows the most accurate quantitative predictions for the test set (q2ext = 0.707), and the XGBoost classification model achieves the most accurate qualitative predictions for the test set (MCC of 0.644, AUC of 0.893, and global accuracy of 82.62%). The application domains were analyzed, and all of the tested compounds fall within the application domain coverage.

Although this feature has been widely used in organometallics to develop homogeneous catalysts, a single-atom heterogeneous analogue has not yet been reported. In this work, we show that a 16-electron complex may act as an important transition state in the CO oxidation over a single Pt atom supported by a MoS2 monolayer (Pt/MoS2). The catalytic oxidation reaction prefers to start with the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) reaction, where the CO and O2 molecules are first co-adsorbed on the Pt atom, then cross a small barrier of 0.40 eV to form a square-planar 16-electron intermediate state, and subsequently the first CO2 is released. The activation barrier of the following Eley–Rideal (E–R) reaction is only 0.23 eV. The superior catalytic reactivity of the Pt/MoS2 surface can be explained by the quantum confinement effect of the Pt-5d orbitals and the stability of the square-planar 16-electron transition state. In addition, MoS2 may serve as a defect-free two dimensional anchoring substrate for Pt atomic adsorption. It provides not only a very large surface-to-volume ratio, but also a well-defined structure with a uniform distribution of anchoring points. The square-planar 16-electron intermediate state of the L–H reaction, together with the new MoS2 anchoring substrate, may provide a new opportunity for the design of single-atom catalysts on two-dimensional surfaces.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1cdebbe17be0a302b98c1f492a935766512d7277,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By analyzing the water distributions of the systems after 1000 simulation steps, we prove that free water does exist in the micellar core.

The prediction of BCRP inhibition can facilitate evaluating potential drug resistance and drug-drug interactions in early stage of drug discovery. Here we reported a structurally diverse dataset consisting of 1098 BCRP inhibitors and 1701 non-inhibitors. Analysis of various physicochemical properties illustrates that BCRP inhibitors are more hydrophobic and aromatic than non-inhibitors. We then developed a series of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to discriminate between BCRP inhibitors and non-inhibitors. The optimal feature subset was determined by a wrapper feature selection method named rfSA (simulated annealing algorithm coupled with random forest), and the classification models were established by using seven machine learning approaches based on the optimal feature subset, including a deep learning method, two ensemble learning methods, and four classical machine learning methods. The statistical results demonstrated that three methods, including support vector machine (SVM), deep neural networks (DNN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), outperformed the others, and the SVM classifier yielded the best predictions (MCC = 0.812 and AUC = 0.958 for the test set). Then, a perturbation-based model-agnostic method was used to interpret our models and analyze the representative features for different models. The application domain analysis demonstrated the prediction reliability of our models. Moreover, the important structural fragments related to BCRP inhibition were identified by the information gain (IG) method along with the frequency analysis.

Human neutrophil peptides 1-3 (HNP1-3) are the most abundant neutrophil granule proteins but their neutrophil content varies because of unusually extensive gene copy number polymorphism. A genetic association study found that increased copy number of the HNP-encoding gene DEFA1/DEFA3 is a risk factor for organ dysfunction during sepsis development. However, direct experimental evidence demonstrating that these risk alleles are pathogenic for sepsis is lacking because the genes are present only in some primates and humans. Here, we generate DEFA1/DEFA3 transgenic mice with neutrophil-specific expression of the peptides. We show that mice with high copy number of DEFA1/DEFA3 genes have more severe sepsis-related vital organ damage and mortality than mice with low copy number of DEFA1/DEFA3 or wild-type mice, resulting from more severe endothelial barrier dysfunction and endothelial cell pyroptosis after sepsis challenge. Mechanistically, HNP-1 induces endothelial cell pyroptosis via P2X7 receptor-mediating canonical caspase-1 activation in a NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent manner. Based on these findings, we engineered a monoclonal antibody against HNP-1 to block the interaction with P2X7 and found that the blocking antibody protected mice carrying high copy number of DEFA1/DEFA3 from lethal sepsis.

To answer this question, we analyzed the important physicochemical properties, structural features, and drug-likeness of the two types of natural products and discussed their differences from the perspective of evolution. In general, MNPs have lower solubility and are often larger than TNPs. On average, particularly from the perspective of unique fragments and scaffolds, MNPs usually possess more long chains and large rings, especially 8- to 10-membered rings. MNPs also have more nitrogen atoms and halogens, notably bromines, and fewer oxygen atoms, suggesting that MNPs may be synthesized by more diverse biosynthetic pathways than TNPs. Analysis of the frequently occurring Murcko frameworks in MNPs and TNPS also reveals a striking difference between MNPs and TNPs. The scaffolds of the former tend to be longer and often contain ester bonds connected to 10-membered rings, while the scaffolds of the latter tend to be shorter and often bear more stable ring systems and bond types.

However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are still largely elusive. Here we show that the IL-6/STAT3 inflammatory signaling axis induces the deacetylation of FRA1 at the Lys-116 residue located within its DNA-binding domain. The HDAC6 deacetylase underlies this key modification leading to the increase of FRA1 transcriptional activity, the subsequent transactivation of NANOG expression, and the acquisition of stem-like cellular features. As validated in a large (n = 123) CRC cohort, IL-6 secretion was invariably accompanied by increased FRA1 deacetylation at K116 and an overall increase in its protein levels, coincident with malignant progression and poor prognosis. Of note, combined treatment with the conventional cytotoxic drug 5-FU together with Tubastatin A, a HDAC6-specific inhibitor, resulted in a significant in vivo synergistic inhibitory effect on tumor growth through suppression of CRC stemness.

Although lots of ABCG2 inhibitors were identified, none of them has been tested clinically, maybe because of several problems such as toxicity or safety and pharmacokinetic uncertainty of compounds with novel chemical structures. One efficient solution is to rediscover new uses for existing drugs with known pharmacokinetics and safety profiles. Here, we found the new use for sorafenib, which has a dual-mode action by inducing ABCG2 degradation in lysosome in addition to inhibiting its function. Previously, we reported some novel dual-acting ABCG2 inhibitors that showed closer similarity to degradation-induced mechanism of action. On the basis of these ABCG2 inhibitors with diverse chemical structures, we developed a pharmacophore model for identifying the critical pharmacophore features necessary for dual-acting ABCG2 inhibitors. Sorafenib forms impressive alignment with the pharmacophore hypothesis, supporting the argument that sorafenib is a potential ABCG2 inhibitor.

The method, SLOGP v1.0, estimates the log P values by summing the contribution of atom-weighted solvent accessible surface areas (SASA) and correction factors. Altogether 100 atom/group types were used to classify atoms with different chemical environments, and two correlation factors were used to consider the intermolecular hydrophobic interactions and intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Coefficient values for 100 atom/group and two correction factors have been derived from a training set of 1850 compounds. The parametrization procedure for different kinds of atoms was performed as follows: first, the atoms in a molecule were defined to different atom/group types based on SMARTS language, and the correction factors were determined by substructure searching; then, SASA for each atom/group type was calculated and added; finally, multivariate linear regression analysis was applied to optimize the hydrophobic parameters for different atom/group types and correction factors in order to reproduce the experimental log P. The correlation based on the training set gives a model with the correlation coefficient (r) of 0.988, the standard deviation (SD) of 0.368 log units, and the absolute unsigned mean error of 0.261. Comparison of various procedures of log P calculations for the external test set of 138 organic compounds demonstrates that our method bears very good accuracy and is comparable or even better than the fragment-based approaches. Moreover, the atom-additive approach based on SASA was compared with the simple atom-additive approach based on the number of atoms. The calculated results show that the atom-additive approach based on SASA gives better predictions than the simple atom-additive one.

Due to the dynamic behavior of ALK in the binding of Type I1/2 inhibitors, the accurate predictions of the binding structures and relative binding potencies of these inhibitors are quite challenging. In this study, different modeling techniques, including molecular docking, ensemble docking based on multiple receptor conformations, molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations, were utilized to explore the binding mechanisms of piperidine carboxamides.

Here, we show the great potential of pre-training in promoting the predictions of important pharmaceutical properties. By utilizing three pre-training tasks based on atom feature prediction, molecular feature prediction and contrastive learning, a new pre-training method K-BERT, which can extract chemical information from SMILES like chemists, was developed.

In addition, we found that the contrastive learning pre-training task enables K-BERT to 'understand' SMILES not limited to canonical SMILES. Moreover, the general fingerprints K-BERT-FP generated by K-BERT exhibit comparative predictive power to MACCS on 15 pharmaceutical datasets and can also capture molecular size and chirality information that traditional binary fingerprints cannot capture.

However, the general-purpose SMILES neglects the characteristics of chemical reactions, where the molecular graph topology is largely unaltered from reactants to products, resulting in the suboptimal performance of SMILES if straightforwardly applied. In this article, we propose the root-aligned SMILES (R-SMILES), which specifies a tightly aligned one-to-one mapping between the product and the reactant SMILES for more efficient synthesis prediction. Due to the strict one-to-one mapping and reduced edit distance, the computational model is largely relieved from learning the complex syntax and dedicated to learning the chemical knowledge for reactions.

After more than five decades of continuing developments, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods have been established as indispensable tools that facilitate fast, reliable and affordable assessments of physicochemical and biological properties of compounds in drug-discovery programs. Currently, there are mainly two types of QSAR methods, descriptor-based methods and graph-based methods. The former is developed based on predefined molecular descriptors, whereas the latter is developed based on simple atomic and bond information. In this study, we presented a simple but highly efficient modeling method by combining molecular graphs and molecular descriptors as the input of a modified graph neural network, called hyperbolic relational graph convolution network plus (HRGCN+). The evaluation results show that HRGCN+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 drug-discovery-related datasets. We also explored the impact of the addition of traditional molecular descriptors on the predictions of graph-based methods, and found that the addition of molecular descriptors can indeed boost the predictive power of graph-based methods. The results also highlight the strong anti-noise capability of our method.

To address this challenge, we propose a method named substructure mask explanation (SME). SME is based on well-established molecular segmentation methods and provides an interpretation that aligns with the understanding of chemists. We apply SME to elucidate how GNNs learn to predict aqueous solubility, genotoxicity, cardiotoxicity and blood-brain barrier permeation for small molecules. SME provides interpretation that is consistent with the understanding of chemists, alerts them to unreliable performance, and guides them in structural optimization for target properties.

First, the prediction capabilities of molecular docking and pharmacophore mapping to distinguish inhibitors from noninhibitors for the selected T2DM-related targets were evaluated. The results show that molecular docking or pharmacophore mapping can give satisfactory predictions for most targets but the validations are still quite necessary because the prediction accuracies of these two methods are variable across different targets. Then, the Bayesian classifiers by integrating the predictions from molecular docking and pharmacophore mapping were developed, and the well-validated Bayesian classifiers for 15 targets were utilized to find the potential inhibitors from TCM and establish the compound-target interaction network. The analysis of the compound-target network demonstrates that a small portion (18.6%) of the predicted inhibitors can interact with multitargets. The pharmacological activities for some potential inhibitors have been experimentally confirmed, highlighting the reliability of the Bayesian classifiers. Besides, it is interesting to find that a considerable number of the predicted multitarget inhibitors have free radical scavenging/antioxidant activities, which are closely related to T2DM. It appears that the pharmacological effect of the TCM formulas is determined not only by the compounds that interact directly with one or more T2DM-related targets, but also by the compounds with other supplementary bioactivities important for relieving T2DM, such as free radical scavenging/antioxidant effects.

Because paclitaxel is metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, the possibility of drug-drug interactions mediated by enzyme inhibition may exist between the combining agents. In the present study, a total of 12 kinase inhibitors were evaluated for inhibitory potency in human liver microsomes by monitoring the formation of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 metabolites simultaneously. For reversible inhibition, nilotinib was found to be the most potent inhibitor against both CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and the inhibition potency could be explained by strong hydrogen binding based on molecular docking simulations and type II binding based on spectral analysis. Comparison of K(i) values revealed that the CYP2C8 pathway was more sensitive toward some kinase inhibitors (such as axitinib), while the CYP3A4 pathway was preferentially inhibited by others (such as bosutinib). Pathway-dependent inactivation (time-dependent inhibition) was also observed for a number of kinase inhibitors against CYP3A4 but not CYP2C8. Further studies showed that axitinib had a K(I) of 0.93 μM and k(inact) of 0.0137 min(-1), and the observed inactivation toward CYP3A4 was probably due to the formation of reactive intermediate(s). Using a static model, a reasonably accurate prediction of drug-drug interactions was achieved by incorporating parallel pathways and hepatic extraction ratio.

Therefore, AR ligands have great potential to treat these diseases. In this study, we searched for novel AR ligands by performing a docking-based virtual screening (VS) on the basis of the crystal structure of the AR ligand binding domain (LBD) in complex with its agonist. A total of 58 structurally diverse compounds were selected and subjected to LBD affinity assay, with five of them (HBP1-3, HBP1-17, HBP1-38, HBP1-51, and HBP1-58) exhibiting strong binding to AR-LBD. The IC50 values of HBP1-51 and HBP1-58 are 3.96 µM and 4.92 µM, respectively, which are even lower than that of enzalutamide (Enz, IC50 = 13.87 µM), a marketed second-generation AR antagonist.

Great progress has been made in studies on the pharmacology and structure of AR, but the atomic level mechanism of the bidirectional communications between the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) and the activation function-2 (AF2) region of AR remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations were carried out to explore the interactions among water, agonist (DHT) or antagonist (HFT), AR, and coactivator (SRC3). Upon the binding of an agonist (DHT) or antagonist (HFT), the LBP structure would transform to the agonistic or antagonistic state, and the conformational changes of the LBP would regulate the structure of the AF2 surface. As a result, the binding of the androgen DHT could promote the recruitment of the coactivator SRC3 to the AF2, and on the contrary, the binding of the antagonist HFT would induce a perturbation to the shape of the AF2 and then weaken its accommodating capability of the coactivators with the LXXLL motif. The simulation results illustrated that the DHT-AR binding affinity was enhanced by the association of the coactivator SRC3, which would reduce the conformational fluctuation of the AR-LBD and expand the size of the AR LBP.

However, from the predictive ability of the test set, the models from the alignment after maximal steric and electrostatic optimization were slightly better than those from the simple atom-by-atom fits. Moreover, systematic variations of some parameters in CoMSIA were performed to search the best 3D-QSAR model. A significant cross-validated q2 was obtained, indicating the predictive potential of the model for the untested compounds; meanwhile the predicted biological activities of the five compounds in the test set were in good agreement with the experimental values.

Currently, SFs relying on sophisticated machine learning techniques have shown great potential in binding affinity prediction and virtual screening. As one of the most indispensable components in the workflow of training a machine learning scoring function (MLSF), the featurization or representation process enables us to catch certain physical processes that are important for protein–ligand interactions and to obtain machine‐readable descriptors. Currently, according to how they are derived, the descriptors used in MLSFs for both continuous and binary binding affinity estimates can be grouped into two broad categories: handcrafted features and automated‐extraction features. Moreover, the automated‐extraction features emerge as a new featurization trend along with the application of deep learning algorithms. Here, we make a thorough summary of the advances in the featurization strategies for protein–ligand interactions in the context of MLSFs, with emphasis on the recently rising automated‐extraction features. We also discuss the similarity between protein–ligand interaction representations and small‐molecule representations, and the challenges confronted by the scientific community in characterizing protein–ligand interactions.

However, clouds of doubts have still been raised against the benefits of this novel type of scoring functions (SFs). In this study, to benchmark the performance of target-specific MLSFs on a relatively unbiased dataset, the MLSFs trained from three representative protein-ligand interaction representations were assessed on the LIT-PCBA dataset, and the classical Glide SP SF and three types of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were also utilized for comparison. Two major aspects in virtual screening campaigns, including prediction accuracy and hit novelty, were systematically explored. The calculation results illustrate that the tested target-specific MLSFs yielded generally superior performance over the classical Glide SP SF, but they could hardly outperform the 2D fingerprint-based QSAR models. Although substantial improvements could be achieved by integrating multiple types of protein-ligand interaction features, the MLSFs were still not sufficient to exceed MACCS-based QSAR models. In terms of the correlations between the hit ranks or the structures of the top-ranked hits, the MLSFs developed by different featurization strategies would have the ability to identify quite different hits. Nevertheless, it seems that target-specific MLSFs do not have the intrinsic attributes of a traditional SF and may not be a substitute for classical SFs.

Great success has been achieved in developing inhibitors targeting the HCV NS3/4A protease over the past decade, but the rapid emergence of drug resistant mutations greatly compromises the efficacy of antiviral drugs or drug candidates. According to the substrate envelope hypothesis (Romano et al., 2010), severe drug resistant mutations would always occur where the inhibitors protrude from the substrate envelope, defined as a consensus volume occupied by the viral substrates in the active site of the NS3/4A protease. However, the substrate envelope hypothesis just qualitatively assesses the impact of mutations to a specific inhibitor, but no quantitative data is obtained. To remedy the weakness, the dynamic binding patterns of HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors or substrates were investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and continuum solvation binding affinity predictions in this study. By comparing the quantitative binding profiles between the substrates and inhibitors, derived from the free energy decomposition analysis, we observed most residues involved in drug resistance form stronger interactions with the inhibitors than with the substrates, which is roughly coincident with the substrate envelope hypothesis and supports the general mechanism of drug resistance: the critical resistant mutations impair more to the binding of inhibitors than that of substrates. Furthermore, our predictions illustrate that the natural substrates of NS3/4A form balanced interactions with the strands 135-139 and 154-160 whereas the inhibitors cannot. Therefore, to overcome drug resistance, it may be necessary to restore the interaction balance between the two strands and the drug candidates.

Recently, the crystal structures of AcrB bound to the high-molecular-mass drugs rifampicin and erythromycin were reported. Here we performed 20 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the AcrB-rifampicin-minocycline complex in a lipid bilayer and explicit water. We found that the bound drugs, rifampicin and erythromycin, made a unidirectional peristaltic movement towards the extrusion funnel of ToIC, which was facilitated by the water efflux in the channel of AcrB. With a shift of the Phe-617 loop, rifampicin in the access monomer moved towards the entrance of the distal binding pocket. Minocycline in the binding monomer moved from the distal binding pocket towards the gate of the central funnel. The channel between the entrance and the gate made a concerted opening during the MD simulations, which was helpful for the peristaltic movement.

Effective atomic radii and screen factors as parameters have been obtained through genetic algorithm optimization in the parameter space to minimize the differences between the calculated and experimental solvation free energies. Here, the calculated solvation free energies are based on a GB model using partial charges fitted from the electrostatic potentials based on the 6-31G* basis set with the nonelectrostatic contributions to the free energy of solvation modeled in terms of the solvent accessible surface area (SASA). The mean unsigned error in the solvation free energies calculated by the GB/surface area calculations using the final parameters of the 328 neutral molecules in the training set is 0.85 kcal/mol, and for the 30 charged molecules the value is 4.36 kcal/mol. The refined parameters were then applied to predict the solvation free energies of 44 neutral or charged organic molecules and 15 proteins, and reliable results were obtained for both organic molecules and proteins. For the 36 neutral organic molecules in the test set, our parameters incurred an unsigned mean error of 0.73 kcal/mol, and for the eight charged molecules in the test set, our parameters incurred an unsigned mean error of 3.65 kcal/mol.

For the 15 proteins randomly selected from the Protein Data Bank, the calculated results from GB/SA based on our new parameters also gave consistent results with those from PB/SA and were much better than GB/SA based on Jayaram’s parameters.

However, an accurate estimation of protein-ligand binding affinity still remains a challenge due to the intrinsic limitation of the standard generalized Born (GB) model used in MM/GBSA. In this study, we proposed and evaluated the MM/GBSA approach based on a variable dielectric generalized Born (VDGB) model using residue-type-based dielectric constants. In the VDGB model, different dielectric values were assigned for the three types of protein residues, and the magnitude of the dielectric constants for residue types follows this order: charged ≥ polar ≥ nonpolar. We found that MM/GBSA based on a VDGB model (MM/GBSAVDGB) with an optimal dielectric constant of 4.0 for the charged residues and 1.0 for the noncharged residues together with a net-charge-dependent dielectric value for ligands achieved better predictions as judged by Pearson's correlation coefficient than the standard MM/GBSA with a uniform solute dielectric constant of 4.0 for the training set of 130 protein-ligand complexes. The prediction on the test set with 165 protein-ligand complexes also validated the better performance of MM/GBSAVDGB. Moreover, this method exhibited potential in predicting the relative binding free energies for multiple ligands against the same target. Furthermore, we found that rational truncation of protein residues far from the binding site can significantly speed up the MM/GBSAVDGB calculations, while it almost does not influence the prediction accuracy.

Further investigation showed that pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with MBPTA significantly suppressed MPP(+)-induced cell death by restoring abnormal changes in nuclear morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential, and numerous apoptotic regulators. MBPTA was able to inhibit MPP(+)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)/NO generation, overexpression of inducible NO synthase, and activation of NF-κB, indicating the critical role of MBPTA in regulating ROS/NO-mediated cell death.

The structural comparison of a series of MBPTA analogs revealed that the benzofuran moiety probably plays a crucial role in the anti-oxidative stress action.

In this study, based on 532 structurally diverse compounds, we present a comprehensive analysis with the aim to build accurate classification models for distinguishing PXR activators from nonactivators by using a naive Bayesian classification technique. First, the distributions of eight important molecular physicochemical properties of PXR activators versus nonactivators were compared, illustrating that the hydrophobicity-related molecular descriptors (AlogP and log D) show slightly better capability to discriminate PXR activators from nonactivators than the others. Then, based on molecular physicochemical properties, VolSurf descriptors, and molecular fingerprints, naive Bayesian classifiers were developed to separate PXR activators from nonactivators. The results demonstrate that the introduction of molecular fingerprints is quite essential to enhance the prediction accuracy of the classifiers. The best Bayesian classifier based on the 21 physicochemical properties, VolSurf descriptors, and LCFC_10 fingerprints descriptors yields a prediction accuracy of 92.7% for the training set based on leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation and of 85.2% for the test set. Moreover, by exploring the important structural fragments derived from the best Bayesian classifier, we observed that flexibility is an important structural pattern for PXR activation. In addition, chemical compounds containing more halogen atoms, unsaturated alkanes chains relevant to π-π stacking, and fewer nitrogen atoms tend to be PXR activators.

Due to the low sequence similarity shared by the transmembrane domains of GPCRs, accurate prediction of GPCR structures by homology modeling is quite challenging. In this study, angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) was taken as a typical case to assess the reliability of class A GPCR homology models for SBDD. Four homology models of angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) at the inactive state were built based on the crystal structures of CXCR4 chemokine receptor, CCR5 chemokine receptor, and δ-opioid receptor, and refined through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and induced-fit docking, to allow for backbone and side-chain flexibility. Then, the quality of the homology models was assessed relative to the crystal structures in terms of two criteria commonly used in SBDD: prediction accuracy of ligand-binding poses and screening power of docking-based virtual screening. It was found that the crystal structures outperformed the homology models prior to any refinement in both assessments. MD simulations could generally improve the docking results for both the crystal structures and homology models. Moreover, the optimized homology model refined by MD simulations and induced-fit docking even shows a similar performance of the docking assessment to the crystal structures.

The binding energies for different TM atoms correlate with the TM d-shell electrons. Sc, Ti, and Co show the largest binding energies of as high as 6 eV, while Zn has the lowest binding energy of about 2 eV. The magnetic moment of silicene can be modulated by embedding TM atoms from V to Co, which mainly comes from the 3d orbitals of TM along with partly contributions from the neighboring Si atoms. Fe atom on SV and Mn atom on DV have the largest magnetic moment of more than 3 μB.

However, existing deep learning methods usually suffer from the scarcity of labeled data and the inability to share information between different tasks when applied to predicting molecular properties, thus resulting in poor generalization capability. Here, we proposed a novel multitask learning BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer) framework, named MTL-BERT, which leverages large-scale pre-training, multitask learning, and SMILES (simplified molecular input line entry specification) enumeration to alleviate the data scarcity problem. MTL-BERT first exploits a large amount of unlabeled data through self-supervised pretraining to mine the rich contextual information in SMILES strings and then fine-tunes the pretrained model for multiple downstream tasks simultaneously by leveraging their shared information. Meanwhile, SMILES enumeration is used as a data enhancement strategy during the pretraining, fine-tuning, and test phases to substantially increase data diversity and help to learn the key relevant patterns from complex SMILES strings. The experimental results showed that the pretrained MTL-BERT model with few additional fine-tuning can achieve much better performance than the state-of-the-art methods on most of the 60 practical molecular datasets.

Inspired by this, researchers have attempted to apply various deep neural network models to simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES) strings, which contain all the composition and structure information of molecules.

Firefly luciferase is commonly used as a reporter to monitor the effect of chemical compounds on the activity of a specific target or pathway in HTS. However, the false positive rate of luciferase-based HTS is relatively high because many artifacts or promiscuous compounds that have direct interaction with the luciferase reporter enzyme are usually identified as active compounds (hits). Therefore, it is necessary to develop a rapid screening method to identify these compounds that can inhibit the luciferase activity directly. In this study, a virtual screening (VS) classification model called MIEC-GBDT (MIEC: Molecular Interaction Energy Components; GBDT: Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) was developed to distinguish luciferase inhibitors from non-inhibitors. The MIECs calculated by Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) free energy decomposition were used to energetically characterize the binding pattern of each small molecule at the active site of luciferase, and then the GBDT algorithm was employed to construct the classifiers based on MIECs. The predictions to the test set show that the optimized MIEC-GBDT model outperformed molecular docking and MM/GBSA rescoring.

The key to photocatalysis field is to search materials with suitable oxidizing and reducing potential. Herein we investigated the novel 2D γ-phosphorus nitride (γ-PN) monolayer as a candidate photocatalyst for reducing water into hydrogen and oxygen from the first-principles and molecular dynamics calculations. Our results show that the 2D γ-PN monolayer is an indirect semiconductor whose conduction and valence band edges matches well with the chemical potential of H+/H2 and O2/H2O. Strain effect is considered to tune the electronic properties of γ-PN. The calculation results reveal that tensile strain decreases the band gap and upshifts the work function of the γ-PN monolayer. The γ-PN monolayer at the 10% tensile strain shows the optimal performance in catalysing the water-splitting due to the low band gap and the better absorption spectrum at the UV-visible light range. Furthermore, the molecular dynamics shows that the γ-PN in the aqueous solution always keep stable after 100 ps simulation. Both the density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation reflect that the γ-PN monolayer is reliable and promising as a water-splitting photocatalyst.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e57983c5388f7593c9788c069ede8d4ad1e8c1e9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive efforts have been made to develop feasible proteinprotein docking approaches to study PPIs in silico. Most of these approaches are composed of two stages: sampling and scoring. Sampling is used to generate a number of plausible protein-protein binding conformations and scoring can rank all those conformations. Due to large and flexible binding interface of PPI, determination of the near native structures is computationally expensive, and therefore computational efficiency is the most challenging issue in protein-protein docking. Here, we have reviewed the basic concepts and implementations of the sampling, scoring and acceleration algorithms in some established docking programs, and the limitations of these algorithms have been discussed.

In our docking procedure, surface complementarity and energetic complementarity of a ligand with its receptor have been considered separately in a two-stage docking method. The first stage was to find a set of potential associated sites mainly based on surface complementarity using a genetic algorithm combined with a tabu search. This step corresponds with the process of finding the potential binding sites where pharmacophores will bind. In the second stage, several hundreds of GA minimization steps were performed for each associated site derived from the first stage mainly based on the energetic complementarity. After calculations for both of the two stages, we can offer several solutions of associated sites for every complex. In this paper, seven biomolecular systems, including five bound complexes and two unbound complexes, were chosen from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to test our method. The calculated results were very encouraging-the hybrid minimization algorithm successfully reaches the correct solutions near the best binded modes for these protein complexes. The docking results not only predict the bound complexes very well, but also get a relatively accurate complexed conformation for unbound systems. For the five bound complexes, the results show that surface complementarity is enough to find the precise binding modes, the top solution from the tabu list generally corresponds to the correct binding mode. For the two unbound complexes, due to the conformational changes upon binding, it seems more difficult to get their correct binding conformations. The predicted results show that the correct binding mode also corresponds to a relatively large surface complementarity score. In these two test cases, the correct solution can be found in the top several solutions from the tabu list. For unbound complexes, the interaction energy from energetic complementarity is very important, it can be used to filter these solutions from the surface complementarity.

Recently, aggregated SWCNTs have shown more significant effects on the treatment of methamphetamine addiction (Nat. Nanotech. 2016, 11, 613). However, the mechanisms underlying these actions are unclear. By using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the effects of single and aggregated SWCNTs (single-(10,10)CNT, aggregated-7-(10,10)CNTs, and single-(35,35)CNT with the same diameter as that of the aggregated one) on the activity of dopamine-related proteins [tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrOH) and dopamine transporter (DAT), which are related to the synthesis and transport of dopamine, respectively]. We find that both TyrOH and DAT can adsorb onto these SWCNTs. For TyrOH, the aggregated-7-(10,10)CNTs mainly affect the conformation of the active site of the protein, and hence, they are more effective in inhibiting the expression of TyrOH. For DAT, our results suggest that the aggregated-7-(10,10)CNTs allow DAT to maintain an outward-facing conformation and hence are favorable to the reuptake of dopamine. The binding of a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, [3H]-WIN35,428, to DAT is significantly disrupted by aggregated-7-(10,10)CNTs and hence improve the ability to transport dopamine.

In various types of human cancers, the neddylation pathway is abnormally activated. Our previous study validated that the neddylation E2 UBE2F is a promising therapeutic target in lung cancer. Although the NAE inhibitor MLN4924/pevonedistat is currently under clinical investigation as an anti-cancer agent, there are no small molecules available that selectively target UBE2F. Here, we report, for the first time, the discovery, via structure-based virtual screen and chemical optimization, of such a small molecule, designated as HA-9104. HA-9104 binds to UBE2F, reduces its protein levels, and consequently inhibits cullin-5 neddylation. Blockage of cullin-5 neddylation inactivates cullin-RING ligase-5 (CRL5) activity, leading to accumulation of the CRL5 substrate, NOXA, to induce apoptosis. Moreover, HA-9104 appears to form the DNA adduct via its 7-azaindole group to induce DNA damage and G2/M arrest. Biologically, HA-9104 effectively suppresses the growth and survival of lung cancer cells and confers radiosensitization in both in vitro cell culture and in vivo xenograft tumor models.

A series of complex pathophysiological cascades contribute to the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, and no therapies have proven effective to prevent hemorrhagic stroke. Stabilization of vascular integrity has been considered as a potential therapeutic target for hemorrhagic stroke. ROCKs, which belong to the serine/threonine protein kinase family and participate in the organization of actin cytoskeleton, have become attractive targets for the treatment of strokes. In this study, in vitro enzyme-based assays revealed that a new compound (FPND) with a novel scaffold identified by docking-based virtual screening could inhibit ROCK1 specifically at low micromolar concentration. Molecular modeling showed that FPND preferentially interacted with ROCK1, and the difference between the binding affinity of FPND toward ROCK1 and ROCK2 primarily resulted from non-polar contributions. Furthermore, FPND significantly prevented statin-induced cerebral hemorrhage in a zebrafish model. In addition, in vitro studies using the xCELLigence RTCA system, immunofluorescence and western blotting revealed that FPND prevented statin-induced cerebral hemorrhage by enhancing endothelial cell-cell junctions through inhibiting the ROCK-mediated VE-cadherin signaling pathway.

In this study, based on a large number of substrates and inhibitors related to five important CYP450 isozymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4), a series of high-performance predictive models for metabolic DDIs were constructed by two machine learning methods (random forest and XGBoost) and 4 different types of descriptors (MOE_2D, CATS, ECFP4 and MACCS). To reduce the uncertainty of individual models, the consensus method was applied to yield more reliable predictions. A series of evaluations illustrated that the consensus models were more reliable and robust for the DDI predictions of new drug combination. For the internal validation, the whole prediction accuracy and AUC value of the DDI models were around 0.8 and 0.9, respectively. When it was applied to the external datasets, the model accuracy was 0.793 and 0.795 for multi-level validation and external validation, respectively. Furthermore, we also compared our model with some recently published tools and then applied the final model to predict FDA-approved drugs and proposed 54,013 possible drug pairs with potential DDIs. In summary, we developed a powerful DDI predictive model from the perspective of the CYP450 enzyme family and it will help a lot in the future drug development and clinical pharmacy research.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c6e121f8bbe8a6b0a8ac2d7cc828e51cb42addec,A powerful DDI predictive model from the perspective of the CYP450 enzyme family is developed and it will help a lot in the future drug development and clinical pharmacy research.,NN.

In this study, the inhibition mechanism of 41 pyrrolopyrimidine derivatives as LIMK2 inhibitors was explored through a series of theoretical approaches. First, a model of LIMK2 was generated through molecular homology modeling, and the studied inhibitors were docked into the binding active site of LIMK2 by the docking protocol, taking into consideration the flexibility of the protein. The binding poses predicted by molecular docking for 17 selected inhibitors with different bioactivities complexed with LIMK2 underwent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and the binding free energies for the complexes were predicted by using the molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) method. The predicted binding free energies correlated well with the experimental bioactivities (r(2) = 0.63 or 0.62). Next, the free energy decomposition analysis was utilized to highlight the following key structural features related to biological activity: (1) the important H-bond between Ile408 and pyrrolopyrimidine, (2) the H-bonds between the inhibitors and Asp469 and Gly471 which maintain the stability of the DFG-out conformation, and (3) the hydrophobic interactions between the inhibitors and several key residues (Leu337, Phe342, Ala345, Val358, Lys360, Leu389, Ile408, Leu458 and Leu472). Finally, a variety of LIMK2 inhibitors with a pyrrolopyrimidine scaffold were designed, some of which showed improved potency according to the predictions.

In addition, DIM-Ph-4-CF(3) exerts anticancer effects independent of these receptors because PPARgamma antagonists do not block its inhibition of cell growth, and the small pocket in the NR4A1 crystal structure suggests no ligand can bind.

Recently, the discovery of inhibitors that block a single isoform of PI3K has continued to attract special attention because they may have higher selectivity for certain tumors and less toxicity for healthy cells. The PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ share fewer studies than α/γ, and therefore, in this work, the combination of molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations was employed to explore the binding of three isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors (COM8, IC87114, and GDC-0941) to PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ. The isoform specificities of the studied inhibitors derived from the predicted binding free energies are in good agreement with the experimental data. In addition, the key residues critical for PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ selectivity were highlighted by decomposing the binding free energies into the contributions from individual residues. It was observed that although PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ share the conserved ATP-binding pockets, individual residues do behave differently, particularly the residues critical for PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ selectivity. It can be concluded that the inhibitor specificity between PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ is determined by the additive contributions from multiple residues, not just a single one. This study provides valuable information for understanding the isoform-specific binding mechanisms of PI3K inhibitors, and should be useful for the rational design of novel and selective PI3K inhibitors.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6087a321cfedf0b6e0c615e60b3917efba44a497,"It can be concluded that the inhibitor specificity between PI3Kβ andPI3Kδ is determined by the additive contributions from multiple residues, not just a single one, which should be useful for the rational design of novel and selective PI3k inhibitors.",J.

Deep generative modeling, aiming to learn complex data distributions, is a promising approach to tackle the conformation generation problem. Here, inspired by stochastic dynamics and recent advances in generative modeling, we developed SDEGen, a novel conformation generation model based on stochastic differential equations. Compared with existing conformation generation methods, it enjoys the following advantages: (1) high model capacity to capture multimodal conformation distribution, thereby searching for multiple low-energy conformations of a molecule quickly, (2) higher conformation generation efficiency, almost ten times faster than the state-of-the-art score-based model, ConfGF, and (3) a clear physical interpretation to learn how a molecule evolves in a stochastic dynamics system starting from noise and eventually relaxing to the conformation that falls in low energy minima.

Compared with Dex, HT-15 shows less transactivation potency that is associated with the main adverse effects of synthetic GCs, and no cross activities with other nuclear receptors. Furthermore, HT-15 exhibits very weak inhibition on the ratio of OPG/RANKL. Therefore, it may reduce the side effects induced by normal GCs.

However, accurate determination of matched molecular pair (MMP) transformations largely depend on the size and quality of existing experimental data.

Here, we developed a new strategy called quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)-assisted-MMPA to expand the number of chemical transformations and took the logD7.4 property endpoint as an example to demonstrate the reliability of the new method. A reliable logD7.4 consensus prediction model was firstly established, and its applicability domain was strictly assessed. By applying the reliable logD7.4 prediction model to screen two chemical databases, we obtained more high-quality logD7.4 data by defining a strict applicability domain threshold. Then, MMPA was performed on the predicted data and experimental data to derive more chemical rules. To validate the reliability of the chemical rules, we compared the magnitude and directionality of the property changes of the predicted rules with those of the measured rules. Then, we compared the novel chemical rules generated by our proposed approach with the published chemical rules, and found that the magnitude and directionality of the property changes were consistent, indicating that the proposed QSAR-assisted-MMPA approach has the potential to enrich the collection of rule types or even identify completely novel rules. Finally, we found that the number of the MMP rules derived from the experimental data could be amplified by the predicted data, which is helpful for us to analyze the medicinal chemical rules in local chemical environment.

HBV infection is a causative factor of HCC and closely associated with HCC development. Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) is a key enzyme for cellular DNA synthesis and RR small subunit M2 (RRM2) is highly upregulated in HCC with poor survival rates. We have previously shown that HBV can activate the expression of RRM2 and the activity of RR enzyme for the viral DNA replication in host liver cells. Thus, RRM2 may be an important therapeutic target for HCC and HBV-related HCC. Pterostilbene, a natural plant component, potently inhibited in vitro RR enzyme activity with the IC50 of about 0.62 μM through interacting with RRM2 protein, which was much higher than current RRM2 inhibitory drugs. Pterostilbine inhibited cell proliferation with an MTT IC50 of about 20-40 μM in various HCC cell lines, causing DNA synthesis inhibition, cell cycle arrest at S phase, and accordingly apoptosis. On the other hand, the compound significantly inhibited HBV DNA replication in HBV genome integrated and newly transfected HCC cells, and the EC50 for inhibiting HBV replication was significantly lower than the IC50 for inhibiting HCC proliferation. Notably, pterostilbene possessed a similar inhibitory activity in sorafenib and lamivudine resistant HCC cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of pterostilbine against HCC proliferation and HBV replication were significantly reversed by addition of dNTP precursors, suggesting that RR was the intracellular target of the compound. Finally, pterostilbine effectively inhibited HCC xenograft growth with a relatively low toxicity in nude mouse experiments.

This dilemma makes optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) an essential tool for automatically mining knowledge from an enormous amount of literature. However, existing OCSR methods fall far short of our expectations for realistic requirements due to their poor recovery accuracy. In this paper, we developed a deep neural network model named ABC-Net (Atom and Bond Center Network) to predict graph structures directly. Based on the divide-and-conquer principle, we propose to model an atom or a bond as a single point in the center. In this way, we can leverage a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate a series of heat-maps to identify these points and predict relevant properties, such as atom types, atom charges, bond types and other properties. Thus, the molecular structure can be recovered by assembling the detected atoms and bonds. Our approach integrates all the detection and property prediction tasks into a single fully CNN, which is scalable and capable of processing molecular images quite efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our method could achieve a significant improvement in recognition performance compared with publicly available tools. The proposed method could be considered as a promising solution to OCSR problems and a starting point for the acquisition of molecular information in the literature.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff3e4ed100d157d3498d49731d6545d6ce5885d5,A deep neural network model named ABC-Net (Atom and Bond Center Network) is developed to predict graph structures directly based on the divide-and-conquer principle and could be considered as a promising solution to OCSR problems and a starting point for the acquisition of molecular information in the literature.,XC.

A major challenge for the clinically used AR antagonists is the rapid emergence of resistance induced by the mutations at AR ligand binding domain (LBD), and therefore the discovery of novel anti-AR therapeutics that can combat mutation-induced resistance is quite demanding. Therein, blocking the interaction between AR and DNA represents an innovative strategy. However, the hits confirmed targeting on it so far are all structurally based on a sole chemical scaffold. In this study, an integrated docking-based virtual screening (VS) strategy based on the crystal structure of the DNA binding domain (DBD) of AR was conducted to search for novel AR antagonists with new scaffolds and 2-(2-butyl-1,3-dioxoisoindoline-5-carboxamido)-4,5-dimethoxybenzoicacid (Cpd39) was identified as a potential hit, which was competent to block the binding of AR DBD to DNA and showed decent potency against AR transcriptional activity. Furthermore, Cpd39 was safe and capable of effectively inhibiting the proliferation of PCa cell lines (i.e., LNCaP, PC3, DU145, and 22RV1) and reducing the expression of the genes regulated by not only the full-length AR but also the splice variant AR-V7.

Despite having been activated through phosphorylation and provided with ATP ligands, several near-atomistic cryo-EM structures of CFTR are in a closed state, as inferred from the lack of a continuous passage through a hydrophobic bottleneck region located in the extracellular portion of the pore. Here, we present repeated, microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations of human CFTR solvated in a lipid bilayer and aqueous NaCl. At equilibrium, Cl- ions enter the channel through a lateral intracellular portal and bind to two distinct cationic sites inside the channel pore but do not traverse the narrow, de-wetted bottleneck. Simulations conducted in the presence of a strong hyperpolarizing electric field led to spontaneous Cl- translocation events through the bottleneck region of the channel, suggesting that the protein relaxed to a functionally open state. Conformational changes of small magnitude involving transmembrane helices 1 and 6 preceded ion permeation through diverging exit routes at the extracellular end of the pore. The pore bottleneck undergoes wetting prior to Cl- translocation, suggesting that it acts as a hydrophobic gate. Although permeating Cl- ions remain mostly hydrated, partial dehydration occurs at the binding sites and in the bottleneck. The observed Cl- pathway is largely consistent with the loci of mutations that alter channel conductance, anion binding, and ion selectivity, supporting the model of the open state of CFTR obtained in the present study.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c3dc6a5c655547b1628772e366a6c4f412ad8be,"The studies surveyed here are mainly focused on the working mechanisms of ABC transporters, including binding of substrates, conformational coupling between nucleotide‐binding domains (NBDs) and transmembrane domains, dynamics of NBDs, and global movement of completetransporters.",ZW.

Understanding NA-ligand interactions at the atomic scale is essential for investigating the molecular mechanism and further assisting in NA-targeted drug discovery. Molecular docking is one of the predominant computational approaches for predicting the interactions between NAs and small molecules. Despite the availability of versatile docking programs, their performance profiles for NA-ligand complexes have not been thoroughly characterized. In this study, we first compiled the largest structure-based NA-ligand binding data set to date, containing 800 noncovalent NA-ligand complexes with clearly identified ligands. Based on this extensive data set, eight frequently used docking programs, including six protein-ligand docking programs (LeDock, Surflex-Dock, UCSF Dock6, AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, and PLANTS) and two specific NA-ligand docking programs (rDock and RLDOCK), were systematically evaluated in terms of binding pose and binding affinity predictions. The results demonstrated that some protein-ligand docking programs, specifically PLANTS and LeDock, produced more promising or comparable results compared with the specialized NA-ligand docking programs. Among the programs evaluated, PLANTS, rDock, and LeDock showed the highest performance in binding pose prediction, and their top-1 and best root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) success rates were as follows: PLANTS (35.93 and 76.05%), rDock (27.25 and 72.16%), and LeDock (27.40 and 64.37%). Compared with the moderate level of binding pose prediction, few programs were successful in binding affinity prediction, and the best correlation (Rp = -0.461) was observed with PLANTS. Finally, further comparison with the latest NA-ligand docking program (NLDock) on four well-established data sets revealed that PLANTS and LeDock outperformed NLDock in terms of binding pose prediction on all data sets, demonstrating their significant potential for NA-ligand docking. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive evaluation of popular molecular docking programs for NA-ligand systems.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4592427f9ee5e80ee40e45bb1b46eff5a16137fe,"Comparison with the latest NA-ligand docking program (NLDock) on four well-established data sets revealed that PLANTS and LeDock outperformed NLDock in terms of binding pose prediction on all data sets, demonstrating their significant potential for NA- ligand docking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides interrupting the PPIs with PPI inhibitors/blockers, increasing evidence shows that stabilizing the interaction between two interacting proteins may also benefit the therapy, such as the development of various types of molecular glues/stabilizers that mostly work by stabilizing the two interacting proteins to regulate the downstream biological effects. However, characterizing the stabilization effect of a stabilizer is usually hard or too complicated for traditional experiments since it involves ternary interactions [protein-protein-stabilizer (PPS) interaction]. Thus, developing reliable computational strategies will facilitate the discovery/design of molecular glues or PPI stabilizers. Here, by fully analyzing the energetic features of the binary interactions in the PPS ternary complex, we systematically investigated the performance of molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) methods on characterizing the stabilization effects of stabilizers in 14-3-3 systems. The results show that both MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA are powerful tools in distinguishing the stabilizers from the decoys (with area under the curves of 0.90-0.93 for all tested cases) and are reasonable for ranking protein-peptide interactions in the presence or absence of stabilizers as well (with the average Pearson correlation coefficient of ~0.6 at a relatively high dielectric constant for both methods). Moreover, to give a detailed picture of the stabilization effects, the stabilization mechanism is also analyzed from the structural and energetic points of view for individual systems containing strong or weak stabilizers.

This BHJ forms during the drying of the wet-deposited solution, because of physical processes such as crystallization and/or liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, the process-structure relationship remains insufficiently understood. In this work, a recently developed, coupled phase-field-fluid mechanics framework is used to simulate the BHJ formation upon drying. For the first time, this allows to investigate the interplay between all the relevant physical processes (evaporation, crystal nucleation and growth, liquid demixing, composition-dependent kinetic properties), within a single coherent theoretical framework. Simulations for the model system P3HT-PCBM are presented. The comparison with previously reported in situ characterization of the drying structure is very convincing: The morphology formation pathways, crystallization kinetics, and final morphology are in line with experimental results. The final BHJ morphology is a subtle mixture of pure crystalline donor and acceptor phases, pure and mixed amorphous domains, which depends on the process parameters and material properties. The expected benefit of such an approach is to identify physical design rules for ink formulation and processing conditions to optimize the cell's performance.

In practice, multiple conflicting objectives and costly evaluations (e.g., wet-lab experiments) make the diversity of candidates paramount. Computational methods have achieved initial success but still struggle with considering diversity in both objective and search space. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) algorithm leveraging the hypernetwork-based GFlowNets (HN-GFN) as an acquisition function optimizer, with the purpose of sampling a diverse batch of candidate molecular graphs from an approximate Pareto front. Using a single preference-conditioned hypernetwork, HN-GFN learns to explore various trade-offs between objectives. We further propose a hindsight-like off-policy strategy to share high-performing molecules among different preferences in order to speed up learning for HN-GFN. We empirically illustrate that HN-GFN has adequate capacity to generalize over preferences. Moreover, experiments in various real-world MOBO settings demonstrate that our framework predominantly outperforms existing methods in terms of candidate quality and sample efficiency.

Ischemia-evoked neuroinflammation is implicated in the progressive brain injury after cerebral ischemia, while Caspase-1, an active component of inflammasome, exaggerates ischemic brain injury. Current Caspase-1 inhibitors are inadequate in safety and druggability. Here, we investigated the efficacy of CZL80, a novel Caspase-1 inhibitor, in mice with PIS. Mice and Caspase-1-/- mice were subjected to photothrombotic (PT)-induced cerebral ischemia. CZL80 (10, 30 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.p.) was administered for one week after PT onset. The transient and the progressive neurological dysfunction (as foot faults in the grid-walking task and forelimb symmetry in the cylinder task) was assessed on Day1 and Day4-7, respectively, after PT onset. Treatment with CZL80 (30 mg/kg) during Day1-7 significantly reduced the progressive, but not the transient neurological dysfunction. Furthermore, we showed that CZL80 administered on Day4-7, when the progressive neurological dysfunction occurred, produced significant beneficial effects against PIS, suggesting an extended therapeutic time-window. CZL80 administration could improve the neurological function even as late as Day43 after PT. In Caspase-1-/- mice with PIS, the beneficial effects of CZL80 were abolished. We found that Caspase-1 was upregulated during Day4-7 after PT and predominantly located in activated microglia, which was coincided with the progressive neurological deficits, and attenuated by CZL80. We showed that CZL80 administration did not reduce the infarct volume, but significantly suppressed microglia activation in the peri-infarct cortex, suggesting the involvement of microglial inflammasome in the pathology of PIS. Taken together, this study demonstrates that Caspase-1 is required for the progressive neurological dysfunction in PIS.

In log D7.4 prediction, graph neural networks (GNNs) can uncover subtle structure-property relationships (SPRs) by automatically extracting features from molecular graphs that facilitate the learning of SPRs, but their performances are often limited by the small size of available datasets. Herein, we present a transfer learning strategy called pretraining on computational data and then fine-tuning on experimental data (PCFE) to fully exploit the predictive potential of GNNs. PCFE works by pretraining a GNN model on 1.71 million computational log D data (low-fidelity data) and then fine-tuning it on 19,155 experimental log D7.4 data (high-fidelity data). The experiments for three GNN architectures (graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), and Attentive FP) demonstrated the effectiveness of PCFE in improving GNNs for log D7.4 predictions. Moreover, the optimal PCFE-trained GNN model (cx-Attentive FP, Rtest2 = 0.909) outperformed four excellent descriptor-based models (random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)). The robustness of the cx-Attentive FP model was also confirmed by evaluating the models with different training data sizes and dataset splitting strategies. Therefore, we developed a webserver and defined the applicability domain for this model. The webserver (http://tools.scbdd.com/chemlogd/) provides free log D7.4 prediction services. In addition, the important descriptors for log D7.4 were detected by the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method, and the most relevant substructures of log D7.4 were identified by the attention mechanism. Finally, the matched molecular pair analysis (MMPA) was performed to summarize the contributions of common chemical substituents to log D7.4, including a variety of hydrocarbon groups, halogen groups, heteroatoms, and polar groups. In conclusion, we believe that the cx-Attentive FP model can serve as a reliable tool to predict log D7.4 and hope that pretraining on low-fidelity data can help GNNs make accurate predictions of other endpoints in drug discovery.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/78883f4224361e1be6ba63590181477a8648235b,A transfer learning strategy called pretraining on computational data and then fine-tuning on experimental data (PCFE) is presented to fully exploit the predictive potential of GNNs and believe that the cx-Attentive FP model can serve as a reliable tool to predict log D7.4 predictions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have expanded the application of machine learning in chemistry, particularly in yield prediction, retrosynthesis, and reaction condition prediction. However, the effectiveness of these models hinges on the integrity of chemical reaction datasets, which are often plagued by inconsistencies like missing reactants, incorrect atom mappings, and outright erroneous reactions. AutoTemplate introduces a two-stage approach to refine these datasets. The first stage involves extracting meaningful reaction transformation rules and formulating generic reaction templates using a simplified SMARTS representation. This simplification broadens the applicability of templates across various chemical reactions. The second stage is template-guided reaction curation, where these templates are systematically applied to validate and correct the reaction data. This process effectively amends missing reactant information, rectifies atom-mapping errors, and eliminates incorrect data entries. A standout feature of AutoTemplate is its capability to concurrently identify and correct false chemical reactions. It operates on the premise that most reactions in datasets are accurate, using these as templates to guide the correction of flawed entries. The protocol demonstrates its efficacy across a range of chemical reactions, significantly enhancing dataset quality. This advancement provides a more robust foundation for developing reliable machine learning models in chemistry, thereby improving the accuracy of forward and retrosynthetic predictions. AutoTemplate marks a significant progression in the preprocessing of chemical reaction datasets, bridging a vital gap and facilitating more precise and efficient machine learning applications in organic synthesis.

However, it is still hard to determine the molecular type of a LBP-bound ligand because both the agonists and antagonists bind to the same position of the protein. Therefore, it is necessary to develop precise and efficient methods to facilitate the discrimination of agonists and antagonists targeting the LBP of NRs. Here, combining structural and energetic analyses with machine-learning (ML) algorithms, we constructed a series of structure-based ML models to determine the molecular category of the LBP-bound ligands.

In the intermolecular dimeric G4-IZCZ-3 binding complexes, IZCZ-3 prefers the c-MYC G4 that has two exposed G-tetrads per monomer over the single G-tetrad-exposed c-KIT G4 by creating more aggregation effects. Taking the aggregation effects into account, the binding affinity order of IZCZ-3 follows c-MYC G4 > c-KIT G4 > telomeric G4, agreeing well with the experimental observation.

We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge.

To this end, we create a large-scale complex dataset containing ∼9 M protein-ligand docking complexes for pre-training, and propose CarsiDock, the first deep learning-guided docking approach that leverages pre-training of millions of predicted protein-ligand complexes. CarsiDock contains two main stages, i.e., a deep learning model for the prediction of protein-ligand atomic distance matrices, and a translation, rotation and torsion-guided geometry optimization procedure to reconstruct the matrices into a credible binding pose. The pre-training and multiple innovative architectural designs facilitate the dramatically improved docking accuracy of our approach over the baselines in terms of multiple docking scenarios, thereby contributing to its outstanding early recognition performance in several retrospective virtual screening campaigns.

The Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) or generalized Born (GB) combined with surface area (SA) continuum solvation method (PBSA and GBSA) have been widely used in SFE calculations because they can achieve good balance between accuracy and efficiency. However, the accuracy of these methods can be affected by several factors such as the charge models, polar and nonpolar SFE calculation methods and the atom radii used in the calculation. In this work, the performance of the ABCG2 (AM1-BCC-GAFF2) charge model as well as other two charge models, that is, RESP (Restrained Electrostatic Potential) and AM1-BCC (Austin Model 1-bond charge corrections), on the SFE prediction of 544 small molecules in water by PBSA/GBSA was evaluated. In order to improve the performance of the PBSA prediction based on the ABCG2 charge, we further explored the influence of atom radii on the prediction accuracy and yielded a set of atom radius parameters for more accurate SFE prediction using PBSA based on the ABCG2/GAFF2 by reproducing the thermodynamic integration (TI) calculation results. The PB radius parameters of carbon, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, chloride, bromide and iodine, were adjusted. New atom types, on, oi, hn1, hn2, hn3, were introduced to further improve the fitting performance. Then, we tuned the parameters in the nonpolar SFE model using the experimental SFE data and the PB calculation results. By adopting the new radius parameters and new nonpolar SFE model, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the SFE calculation for the 544 molecules decreased from 2.38 to 1.05 kcal/mol. Finally, the new radius parameters were applied in the prediction of protein-ligand binding free energies using the MM-PBSA method. For the eight systems tested, we could observe higher correlation between the experiment data and calculation results and smaller prediction errors for the absolute binding free energies, demonstrating that our new radius parameters can improve the free energy calculation using the MM-PBSA method.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c84f19ccc84db3cea17c45db69b9cf8881cad5a5,,Y.

The accurate prediction of these properties remains to be solved due to data scarcity. Current methodologies neglect the intrinsic relationships between physicochemical properties and usually ignore the ionization effects. Here, we propose an attention-driven mixture-of-experts (MoE) model named ALipSol, which explicitly reproduces the hierarchy of task relationships. We adopt the principle of divide-and-conquer by breaking down the complex end point (logD or logSw) into simpler ones (acidic pKa, basic pKa, and logP) and allocating a specific expert network for each subproblem. Subsequently, we implement transfer learning to extract knowledge from related tasks, thus alleviating the dilemma of limited data. Additionally, we substitute the gating network with an attention mechanism to better capture the dynamic task relationships on a per-example basis. We adopt local fine-tuning and consensus prediction to further boost model performance. Extensive evaluation experiments verify the success of the ALipSol model, which achieves RMSE improvement of 8.04%, 2.49%, 8.57%, 12.8%, and 8.60% on the Lipop, ESOL, AqSolDB, external logD, and external logS data sets, respectively, compared with Attentive FP and the state-of-the-art in silico tools. In particular, our model yields more significant advantages (Welch's t-test) for small training data, implying its high robustness and generalizability.

Compound 3-({[4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-6-methyl-2-pyrimidinyl]thio}methyl)benzoic acid (Z-312) is a novel small -molecule inhibitor of MIF tautomeric activity. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of Z-312 on liposaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that Z-312 significantly decreased the production of nitric oxide (NO), interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated microglial cells. Mechanistically, nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, degradation and phosphorylation of IκBα, NF-κB transcriptional activity and phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and JNK were markedly attenuated by pretreatment with Z-312 in BV-2 microglial cells. In addition, Z-312 suppressed the neurotoxic effects of cell culture medium of LPS-activated BV-2 microglia on cocultured mouse HT22 neuroblastoma cells. An in vivo study demonstrated that Z-312 markedly ameliorated microglial activation and subsequent DA neuron loss in an LPS-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model.

Here, as a possible way to alleviate the problem, several widely used implicit-solvent models, which are derived from the analytic generalized Born (GB) equation and implemented in the AMBER suite of programs, were employed in free energy calculations based on non-equilibrium work and evaluated for their abilities to emulate explicit water. As a test case, pulling MD simulations were carried out on an alanine polypeptide with different solvent models and protocols, followed by comparisons of the reconstructed PMF profiles along the unfolding coordinate. The results show that when employing the non-equilibrium work method, sampling with an implicit-solvent model is several times faster and, more importantly, converges more rapidly than that with explicit water due to reduction of dissipation. Among the assessed GB models, the Neck variants outperform the OBC and HCT variants in terms of accuracy, whereas their computational costs are comparable.

GR TA is involved in many adverse effects of GR-targeting drugs, and therefore, the discovery of novel GR ligands with lower TA activity and longer residence time is quite urgent. Undoubtedly, understanding the ligand dissociation mechanisms and the structural basis of the TA regulation is crucial for the development of novel GR-targeting drugs. Here, we used random accelerated molecular dynamics (RAMD) and funnel metadynamics (FM) simulations to explore the dissociation mechanisms of 5 classic glucocorticoids and 6 nonsteroidal GR ligands. Multiple ligand dissociation pathways were discovered. The classic glucocorticoids exhibit a strong preference for Path I, and most nonsteroidal ligands tend to dissociate along mixed pathways.

First, we explored the effects of the length of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, ranging from 400 to 4800 ps, and the solute dielectric constant (1, 2, or 4) on the binding free energies predicted by MM/PBSA. The following three important conclusions could be observed: (1) MD simulation length has an obvious impact on the predictions, and longer MD simulation is not always necessary to achieve better predictions. (2) The predictions are quite sensitive to the solute dielectric constant, and this parameter should be carefully determined according to the characteristics of the protein/ligand binding interface. (3) Conformational entropy often show large fluctuations in MD trajectories, and a large number of snapshots are necessary to achieve stable predictions. Next, we evaluated the accuracy of the binding free energies calculated by three Generalized Born (GB) models. We found that the GB model developed by Onufriev and Case was the most successful model in ranking the binding affinities of the studied inhibitors. Finally, we evaluated the performance of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA in predicting binding free energies.

The method, SAWSA v2.0, gives the aqueous solvation free energy by summing the contributions of component atoms and a correction factor. We applied two different sets of atom typing rules and fitting processes for small organic molecules and proteins, respectively. For small organic molecules, the model classified the atoms in organic molecules into 65 basic types and additionally. For small organic molecules we proposed a correction factor of ""hydrophobic carbon"" to account for the aggregation of hydrocarbons and compounds with long hydrophobic aliphatic chains. The contributions for each atom type and correction factor were derived by multivariate regression analysis of 379 neutral molecules and 39 ions with known experimental aqueous solvation free energies. Based on the new atom typing rules, the correlation coefficient (r) for fitting the whole neutral organic molecules is 0.984, and the absolute mean error is 0.40 kcal mol(-1), which is much better than those of the model proposed by Wang et al. and the SAWSA model previously proposed by us. Furthermore, the SAWSA v2.0 model was compared with the simple atom-additive model based on the number of atom types (NA). The calculated results show that for small organic molecules, the predictions from the SAWSA v2.0 model are slightly better than those from the atom-additive model based on NA. However, for macromolecules such as proteins, due to the connection between their molecular conformation and their molecular surface area, the atom-additive model based on the number of atom types has little predictive power. In order to investigate the predictive power of our model, a systematic comparison was performed on seven solvation models including SAWSA v2.0, GB/SA_1, GB/SA_2, PB/SA_1, PB/SA_2, AM1/SM5.2R and SM5.0R. The results showed that for organic molecules the SAWSA v2.0 model is better than the other six solvation models. For proteins, the model classified the atoms into 20 basic types and the predicted aqueous free energies of solvation by PB/SA were used for fitting. The solvation model based on the new parameters was employed to predict the solvation free energies of 38 proteins.

Among the various methods to calculate protein-ligand binding affinities, alchemical free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations performed by way of explicitly solvated molecular dynamics simulations (FEP/MD) provide a thermodynamically rigorous and complete description of the binding event and should in turn yield highly accurate predictions. Although the original theory of FEP was proposed more than 60 years ago, subsequent applications of FEP to compute protein-ligand binding free energies in the context of drug discovery projects over much of that time period was sporadic and generally unsuccessful. This was mainly due to the limited accuracy of the available force fields, inadequate sampling of the protein-ligand conformational space, complexity of simulation set up and analysis, and the large computational resources required to pursue such calculations. Over the past few years, there have been advances in computing power, classical force field accuracy, enhanced sampling algorithms, and simulation setup. This has led to newer FEP implementations such as the FEP+ technology developed by Schrödinger Inc., which has enabled accurate and reliable calculations of protein-ligand binding free energies and positioned free energy calculations to play a guiding role in small-molecule drug discovery. In this chapter, we outline the methodological advances in FEP+, including the OPLS3 force fields, the REST2 (Replica Exchange with Solute Tempering) enhanced sampling, the incorporation of REST2 sampling with conventional FEP (Free Energy Perturbation) through FEP/REST, and the advanced simulation setup and data analysis.

Despite the introduction of deep generative models for molecular generation, the atom-wise generation paradigm that partially contradicts chemical intuition limits the validity and synthetic accessibility of the generated molecules. Additionally, the dependence of deep learning models on large-scale structural data has hindered their adaptability across different targets. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel search-based framework, 3D-MCTS, for structure-based de novo drug design. Distinct from prevailing atom-centric methods, 3D-MCTS employs a fragment-based molecular editing strategy. The fragments decomposed from small-molecule drugs are recombined under predefined retrosynthetic rules, offering improved drug-likeness and synthesizability, overcoming the inherent limitations of atom-based approaches. Leveraging multi-threaded parallel simulations combined with a real-time energy constraint-based pruning strategy, 3D-MCTS achieves remarkable efficiency. At a fixed computational cost, it outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by producing molecules with enhanced binding affinity. Furthermore, its fragment-based approach ensures the generation of more dependable binding conformations, exhibiting a success rate 43.6% higher than that of other SOTAs. This advantage becomes even more pronounced when handling targets that significantly deviate from the training dataset. 3D-MCTS is capable of achieving thirty times more hits with high binding affinity than traditional virtual screening methods, which demonstrates the superior ability of 3D-MCTS to explore chemical space. Moreover, the flexibility of our framework makes it easy to incorporate domain knowledge during the process, thereby enabling the generation of molecules with desirable pharmacophores and enhanced binding affinity.

However, the functions of VLCFA elongases in phytopathogenic fungi remain largely unexplored. Here, we identified a single copy of the VLCFA elongase gene FgELO2 in Fusarium graminearum that causes Fusarium head blight worldwide. FgElo2 localized to ER membrane, and deletion mutant of FgELO2 exhibited serious defects in vegetative growth and conidiation. Importantly, ΔFgElo2 led to ergosterol content reduction and disrupted the ER-localization of 14-α-demethylase FgCyp51s, indicating that the scarce of SLs reduced ergosterol, which ultimately elevated the sensitivity of ΔFgElo2 to tebuconazole. Fluorescent microscopic examination suggested that FgElo2 was degraded upon cell membrane stress. ΔFgElo2 showed decreased phosphorylation of high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway and subsequently exhibited remarkable sensitivity to osmotic stress. In addition, fungal virulence was dramatically reduced in ΔFgElo2 via inhibiting deoxynivalenol production and formation of infection structures.

In this study, based on the reported crystal structures, the dynamics of the TRD loop in different multimerization with/without the bound guest molecule, namely the ADD domain or the DNA molecule, was investigated using conventional molecular dynamics (MD) and umbrella sampling simulations. The simulation results illustrate that the TRD loop exhibits relatively higher flexibility than the other components in the whole catalytic domain (CD), which could be well stabilized into different local minima through the binding with either the ADD domain or the DNA molecule by forming tight hydrogen-bond and salt-bridge networks involving distinct residues. Moreover, the movement of the TRD loop away from the catalytic loop upon activation could be triggered simply by the detachment of the ADD domain, but not necessarily induced by the ADD domain relocation on the CD.

Recently, the crystal structure of the vcCNT (Vibrio cholerae Concentrative Nucleoside Transporter) was reported. Here we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the vcCNT structure in the presence of various sodium gradients, since CNTs are sodium-coupled transporters. The results highlight the important role of sodium bound to the vcCNT in the transport of uridine. Our MD simulations show that, without NaCl, uridine remains stable in the binding pocket of the vcCNT. In the presence of 20 mM NaCl, uridine moves from the binding pocket and approaches the entrance of the intracellular side. In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, uridine passes through most part of the entrance and approaches the intracellular side. The polar/charged amino acids in the binding pocket are important in the transport process. They first ""fix"" the ribose and allow the uracil base of uridine to approach the entrance of the intracellular side, and then ""release"" the ribose to allow uridine to move freely into the intracellular side coupled with the movement of sodium ions and HP1b.

A large number of PROTACs have been reported, but due to the complicated structural and kinetic characteristics of the target-PROTAC-E3 ligase ternary interaction process, the rational design of PROTACs is still quite challenging. Here, we characterized and analyzed the kinetic mechanism of MZ1, a PROTAC that targets the bromodomain (BD) of the bromodomain and extra terminal (BET) protein (Brd2, Brd3, or Brd4) and von Hippel-Lindau E3 ligase (VHL), from the kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives of view by using enhanced sampling simulations and free energy calculations. The simulations yielded satisfactory predictions on the relative residence time and standard binding free energy (rp > 0.9) for MZ1 in different BrdBD-MZ1-VHL ternary complexes. Interestingly, the simulation of the PROTAC ternary complex disintegration illustrates that MZ1 tends to remain on the surface of VHL with the BD proteins dissociating alone without a specific dissociation direction, indicating that the PROTAC prefers more to bind with E3 ligase at the first step in the formation of the target-PROTAC-E3 ligase ternary complex. Further exploration of the degradation difference of MZ1 in different Brd systems shows that the PROTAC with higher degradation efficiency tends to leave more lysine exposed on the target protein, which is guaranteed by the stability (binding affinity) and durability (residence time) of the target-PROTAC-E3 ligase ternary complex.

Significant progress has been made by resorting to generative models for graphs. However, limited attention is paid to hierarchical generative models, which can exploit the inherent hierarchical structure (with rich semantic information) of the molecular graphs and generate complex molecules of larger size that we shall demonstrate to be difficult for most existing models. The primary challenge to hierarchical generation is the non-differentiable issue caused by the generation of intermediate discrete coarsened graph structures. To sidestep this issue, we cast the tricky hierarchical generation problem over discrete spaces as the reverse process of hierarchical representation learning and propose MolHF, a new hierarchical flow-based model that generates molecular graphs in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, MolHF first generates bonds through a multi-scale architecture, then generates atoms based on the coarsened graph structure at each scale. We demonstrate that MolHF achieves state-of-the-art performance in random generation and property optimization, implying its high capacity to model data distribution. Furthermore, MolHF is the first flow-based model that can be applied to model larger molecules (polymer) with more than 100 heavy atoms.

One of the reasons for the resistance is the internalization and recycling of PD-L1 itself upon antibody binding. The inhibition of lysosome-mediated degradation of PD-L1 is critical for preserving the amount of PD-L1 recycling back to the cell membrane. In this study, we find that Hsc70 promotes PD-L1 degradation through the endosome-lysosome pathway and reduces PD-L1 recycling to the cell membrane.

Traditional LD methodologies rely on a search and scoring framework, utilizing heuristic algorithms to explore binding conformations and scoring functions to evaluate binding strengths. However, to meet the efficiency demands of SBVS, these algorithms and functions are often simplified, prioritizing speed over accuracy.The emergence of deep learning (DL) has exerted a profound impact on diverse fields, ranging from natural language processing to computer vision and drug discovery. DeepMind's AlphaFold2 has impressively exhibited its ability to accurately predict protein structures solely from amino acid sequences, highlighting the remarkable potential of DL in conformation prediction. This groundbreaking advancement circumvents the traditional search-scoring frameworks in LD, enhancing both accuracy and processing speed and thereby catalyzing a broader adoption of DL algorithms in binding pose prediction. Nevertheless, a consensus on certain aspects remains elusive.In this Account, we delineate the current status of employing DL to augment LD within the VS paradigm, highlighting our contributions to this domain. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and future prospects, drawing insights from our scholarly investigations. Initially, we present an overview of VS and LD, followed by an introduction to DL paradigms, which deviate significantly from traditional search-scoring frameworks. Subsequently, we delve into the challenges associated with the development of DL-based LD (DLLD), encompassing evaluation metrics, application scenarios, and physical plausibility of the predicted conformations. In the evaluation of LD algorithms, it is essential to recognize the multifaceted nature of the metrics. While the accuracy of binding pose prediction, often measured by the success rate, is a pivotal aspect, the scoring/screening power and computational speed of these algorithms are equally important given the pivotal role of LD tools in VS. Regarding application scenarios, early methods focused on blind docking, where the binding site is unknown. However, recent studies suggest a shift toward identifying binding sites rather than solely predicting binding poses within these models. In contrast, LD with a known pocket in VS has been shown to be more practical. Physical plausibility poses another significant challenge. Although DLLD models often achieve higher success rates compared to traditional methods, they may generate poses with implausible local structures, such as incorrect bond angles or lengths, which are disadvantageous for postprocessing tasks like visualization. Finally, we discuss the future perspectives for DLLD, emphasizing the need to improve generalization ability, strike a balance between speed and accuracy, account for protein conformation flexibility, and enhance physical plausibility.

This recognition has prompted the broader acceptance of RNA as a viable candidate for drug targets. Delving into the atomic-scale understanding of RNA-ligand interactions holds paramount importance in unraveling intricate molecular mechanisms and further contributing to RNA-based drug discovery. Computational approaches, particularly molecular docking, offer an efficient way of predicting the interactions between RNA and small molecules. However, the accuracy and reliability of these predictions heavily depend on the performance of scoring functions (SFs). In contrast to the majority of SFs used in RNA-ligand docking, the end-point binding free energy calculation methods, such as molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) and molecular mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA), stand as theoretically more rigorous approaches. Yet, the evaluation of their effectiveness in predicting both binding affinities and binding poses within RNA-ligand systems remains unexplored. This study first reported the performance of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA with diverse solvation models, interior dielectric constants (εin) and force fields in the context of binding affinity prediction for 29 RNA-ligand complexes. MM/GBSA is based on short (5 ns) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in an explicit solvent with the YIL force field; the GBGBn2 model with higher interior dielectric constant (εin = 12, 16 or 20) yields the best correlation (Rp = -0.513), which outperforms the best correlation (Rp = -0.317, rDock) offered by various docking programs. Then, the efficacy of MM/GBSA in identifying the near-native binding poses from the decoys was assessed based on 56 RNA-ligand complexes. However, it is evident that MM/GBSA has limitations in accurately predicting binding poses for RNA-ligand systems, particularly compared with notably proficient docking programs like rDock and PLANTS. The best top-1 success rate achieved by MM/GBSA rescoring is 39.3%, which falls below the best results given by docking programs (50%, PLNATS). This study represents the first evaluation of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA for RNA-ligand systems and is expected to provide valuable insights into their successful application to RNA targets.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a80aa7197778c7aeadf0fe60d2bc58ce0f929f1,This study represents the first evaluation of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA for RNA-ligand systems and is expected to provide valuable insights into their successful application to RNA targets.,D.

Nuclear receptors (NRs), as an important target family, play important roles in regulating a variety of physiological processes in vivo. However, it is hard to understand the drug-NR interaction process because of the closed structure of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the NR proteins, which apparently hinders the rational design of drugs with controllable kinetic properties. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanism of the ligand-NR interaction process seems necessary to help NR drug design. However, it is usually difficult for experimental approaches to interpret the kinetic process of drug-target interactions. Therefore, in silico methods were utilized to explore the optimal binding/dissociation pathways of the NR ligands. Specifically, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is considered here as the target system since it has been an important target for the treatment of bile acid metabolism-associated diseases, and a series of structures cocrystallized with diverse scaffold ligands were resolved. By using random acceleration molecular dynamics (RAMD) simulation and umbrella sampling (US), 5 main dissociation pathways (pathways I-V) were identified in 11 representative FXR ligands, with most of them (9/11) preferring to go through Pathway III and the remaining two favoring escaping from Pathway I and IV. Furthermore, key residues functioning in the three main dissociation pathways were revealed by the kinetic residue energy analysis (KREA) based on the US trajectories, which may serve as road-marker residues for rapid identification of the (un)binding pathways of FXR ligands. Moreover, the preferred pathways explored by RAMD simulations are in good agreement with the minimum free energy path identified by the US simulations with the Pearson R = 0.76 between the predicted binding affinity and the experimental data, suggesting that RAMD is suitable for applying in large-scale (un)binding-pathway exploration in the case of ligands with obscure binding tunnels to the target.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6de2760538ae0ba35b79c4b15a4e5e8eac4f9019,"In silico methods were utilized to explore the optimal binding/dissociation pathways of the nuclear receptors of farnesoid X receptor, suggesting that RAMD is suitable for applying in large-scale (un)binding-pathway exploration in the case of ligands with obscure binding tunnels to the target.",S.

Previously developed models are often limited to resolving one (or few) certain subtask(s) of lead optimization, and most of them can only generate the two-dimensional structures of molecules while disregarding the vital protein-ligand interactions based on the three-dimensional binding poses.

In general, molecular generation encompasses two main strategies: de novo design, which generates novel molecular structures from scratch, and lead optimization, which refines existing molecules into drug candidates. Among them, lead optimization plays an important role in real-world drug design. For example, it can enable the development of me-better drugs that are chemically distinct yet more effective than the original drugs. It can also facilitate fragment-based drug design, transforming virtual-screened small ligands with low affinity into first-in-class medicines. Despite its importance, automated lead optimization remains underexplored compared to the well-established de novo generative models, due to its reliance on complex biological and chemical knowledge. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic review of traditional computational methods for lead optimization, organizing these strategies into four principal sub-tasks with defined inputs and outputs. This review delves into the basic concepts, goals, conventional CADD techniques, and recent advancements in AIDD. Additionally, we introduce a unified perspective based on constrained subgraph generation to harmonize the methodologies of de novo design and lead optimization. Through this lens, de novo design can incorporate strategies from lead optimization to address the challenge of generating hard-to-synthesize molecules; inversely, lead optimization can benefit from the innovations in de novo design by approaching it as a task of generating molecules conditioned on certain substructures.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7334967da38a0e9d6f0719d0a0e1ffa3403140b3,"This review delves into the basic concepts, goals, conventional CADD techniques, and recent advancements in AIDD, and introduces a unified perspective based on constrained subgraph generation to harmonize the methodologies of de novo design and lead optimization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aforementioned issues may not be fully captured by commonly used metrics for the assessment of molecular generative models, such as novelty, diversity, and quantitative estimation of the drug-likeness score. To address these limitations, we proposed a genetic algorithm-guided generative model called GARel (genetic algorithm-based receptor-ligand interaction generator), a novel framework for training a DL-based generative model to produce drug-like molecules with novel scaffolds. To efficiently train the GARel model, we utilized dense net to update the parameters based on molecules with novel scaffolds and drug-like features. To demonstrate the capability of the GARel model, we used it to design inhibitors for three targets: AA2AR, EGFR, and SARS-Cov2. The results indicate that GARel-generated molecules feature more diverse and novel scaffolds and possess more desirable physicochemical properties and favorable docking scores.

Furthermore, our workflow is highly modularized, allowing straightforward integration and extension of various simulation techniques, and is highly accessible to nonexperts. This workflow was validated by calculating the relative binding free energies of large-scale congeneric ligands, many of which have large perturbing groups. The agreement between the calculations and experiments was excellent, with an average unsigned error of 1.08 ± 0.47 kcal/mol. More than 57.1% of the ligands had an error of less than 1.0 kcal/mol, and the perturbations of 6 targets were fully connected via the calculations, while those of 2 targets were connected via both calculations and experimental data.

Microscale thermophoresis indicated that MB inhibited RNR activity by binding to RRM2. MB inhibited cell proliferation (MTT IC50 = 6-18 μM) and caused dose-dependent DNA synthesis inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in AML cells. The cell cycle arrest was reversed by the addition of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates precursors, suggesting that RNR was the intracellular target of the compound. Moreover, MB overcame drug resistance to the common AML drugs cytarabine and doxorubicin, and treatment with the combination of MB and the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 exerted a synergistic inhibitory effect.

Herein, we employed experimental and computational biology techniques to investigate the inhibitory properties of phenolics, identified from four in vitro gastrointestinal digested (IVGD) soft fruits, on PTP1B. Analysis by LC-MS/MS identified specific phenolics that inhibited PTP1B in vitro. Enzyme kinetics identified the mode of inhibition, while dynamics, stability and binding mechanisms of PTP1B-ligand complex were investigated through molecular modelling, docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and MM/PBSA binding free energy estimation. IVGD extracts and specific phenolics identified from the four soft fruits inhibited PTP1B (P < 0.0001) activity. Among the phenolics tested, the greatest inhibition was shown by malvidin-3-glucoside (P < 0.0001) and gallic acid (P < 0.0001). Malvidin-3-glucoside (Ki = 3.8 µg/mL) was a competitive inhibitor and gallic acid (Ki = 33.3 µg/mL) a non-competitive inhibitor of PTP1B. Malvidin-3-glucoside exhibited better binding energy than gallic acid and the synthetic inhibitor Dephostatin (-7.38 > -6.37 > -5.62 kcal/mol) respectively. Principal component analysis demonstrated malvidin-3-glucoside PTP1B-complex occupies more conformational space where critical WPD-loop displayed a higher degree of motion. MM/PBSA binding free energy for malvidin-3-glucoside to PTP1B was found to be higher than other complexes mediated by Van der Waals energy rather than electrostatic interaction for the other two inhibitors (-80.32 ± 1.25 > -40.64 ± 1.43 > -21.63 ± 1.73 kcal/mol) respectively.

One of the key structural features of PAPs is the presence of a β-hairpin motif otherwise known as flap. The biological function of the PAPs is highly dependent on the conformational dynamics of the flap region. In apo PAPs, the conformational dynamics of the flap is dominated by the rotational degrees of freedom associated with χ1 and χ2 angles of conserved Tyr (or Phe in some cases). However it is plausible that dihedral order parameters associated with several other residues might play crucial roles in the conformational dynamics of apo PAPs. Due to their size, complexities associated with conformational dynamics and clinical significance (drug targets for malaria, Alzheimer's disease etc.), PAPs provide a challenging testing ground for computational and experimental methods focusing on understanding conformational dynamics and molecular recognition in biomolecules. The opening of the flap region is necessary to accommodate substrate/ligand in the active site of the PAPs. The BIG challenge is to gain atomistic details into how reversible ligand binding/unbinding (molecular recognition) affects the conformational dynamics. Recent reports of kinetics (K i, K d) and thermodynamic parameters (ΔH, TΔS, and ΔG) associated with macro-cyclic ligands bound to BACE1 (belongs to PAP family) provide a perfect challenge (how to deal with big ligands with multiple torsional angles and select optimum order parameters to study reversible ligand binding/unbinding) for computational methods to predict binding free energies and kinetics beyond typical test systems e.g. benzamide-trypsin. In this work, i reviewed several order parameters which were proposed to capture the conformational dynamics and molecular recognition in PAPs. I further highlighted how machine learning methods can be used as order parameters in the context of PAPs. I then proposed some open ideas and challenges in the context of molecular simulation and put forward my case on how biophysical experiments e.g. NMR, time-resolved FRET etc. can be used in conjunction with biomolecular simulation to gain complete atomistic insights into the conformational dynamics of PAPs.",,,S.

The elevated activity of gelatinases plays the deleterious role in ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke and perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Therefore, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 inhibition have therapeutic importance in stroke condition. Present in silico study investigates whether Withania somnifera (WS) phytochemicals inhibit the MMP-2 and MMP-9 by binding to the catalytic domain, as similar to their inhibitor or not. For that, we performed molecular docking study to evaluate the gelatinases-inhibitory potential of 36 WS phytochemicals, which compared with gelatinases inhibitors viz. hydroxamic acid, quercetin, doxycycline, minocycline and reverse hydroxamate. The results suggest that 28 out of 36 WS phytochemicals show higher affinity for MMP-2 owing to bind with active site residues of S1'-pocket with lower binding energy and smaller inhibition constant (Ki) than considered inhibitors. As well as, withanolide G and withafastuosin E show higher affinity for MMP-9 than reverse hydroxamate inhibitor.

One previously reported triad consisting of two perylene monoimides strongly coupled to a free base porphyrin via ethyne linkers (FbT) shows panchromatic absorption together with a porphyrin-like S1 excited state albeit at lower energy than that of a typical monomeric porphyrin. Here, two new porphyrin-bis(perylene) triads have been prepared wherein the porphyrin bears two pentafluorophenyl substituents. The porphyrin is in the free base (FbT-F) or zinc chelate (ZnT-F) forms. The zinc chelate (ZnT) of the original triad bearing nonfluorinated aryl rings also was prepared. The triads were characterized using static and time-resolved optical spectroscopy. The results were analyzed with the aid of molecular-orbital characteristics obtained using density functional theory calculations. Of the four triads, FbT is the most panchromatic in affording the most even distribution of absorption spectral intensity as well as exhibiting the largest wavelength span (380-750 nm). The triads exhibit fluorescence yields (0.35 for FbT-F in toluene) that are substantially greater than for the porphyrin benchmarks (0.049 for FbP-F). The singlet excited-state lifetimes (τS) for the triads in toluene decrease in the order FbT-F (2.7 ns) > FbT (2.0 ns) > ZnT (1.2 ns) ∼ ZnT-F (1.1 ns). The τS values in benzonitrile are FbT (1.3 ns) > FbT-F (1.2 ns) > ZnT-F (0.6 ns) > ZnT (0.2 ns).

Further optimization of the hydrophobic binding groups on 16l afforded a lead compound (R, S)-16s, which exhibited a 64-fold more potent inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.045 ± 0.002 μM) toward IAV polymerase.

From the perspective of free-energy analysis, we find that the conformational dynamics of mGlu2's subunit follow coupled rather than discrete, independent actions. Asymmetric dimerization is critical for receptor activation. Our calculation results are consistent with the observation of cross-linking and fluorescent-labeled blot experiments, thus illustrating the reliability of our calculations.

Here, funnel metadynamics is employed to elucidate the inherent regulation mechanisms of three AR antagonists (hydroxyflutamide, enzalutamide, and darolutamide) on AR. For the first time it is observed that the binding of antagonists significantly disturbed the C-terminus of AR helix-11, thereby disrupting the specific internal hydrophobic contacts of AR-LBD and correspondingly the communication between AR ligand binding pocket (AR-LBP), activation function 2 (AF2), and binding function 3 (BF3). The subsequent bioassays verified the necessity of the hydrophobic contacts for AR function. Furthermore, it is found that darolutamide, a newly approved AR antagonist capable of fighting almost all reported drug resistant AR mutants, can induce antagonistic binding structure. Subsequently, docking-based virtual screening toward the dominant binding conformation of AR for darolutamide is conducted, and three novel AR antagonists with favorable binding affinity and strong capability to combat drug resistance are identified by in vitro bioassays.

Although previous studies have addressed the performance of AF2 structures in virtual screening (VS), a more comprehensive investigation is still necessary considering the paramount importance of structural accuracy in drug design. In this study, we evaluate the performance of AF2 structures in VS across three common drug discovery scenarios: targets with holo, apo, and AF2 structures; targets with only apo and AF2 structures; and targets exclusively with AF2 structures. We utilized both the traditional physics-based Glide and the deep-learning-based scoring function RTMscore to rank the compounds in the DUD-E, DEKOIS 2.0, and DECOY data sets. The results demonstrate that, overall, the performance of VS on AF2 structures is comparable to that on apo structures but notably inferior to that on holo structures across diverse scenarios. Moreover, when a target has solely AF2 structure, selecting the holo structure of the target from different subtypes within the same protein family produces comparable results with the AF2 structure for VS on the data set of the AF2 structures, and significantly better results than the AF2 structures on its own data set. This indicates that utilizing AF2 structures for docking-based VS may not yield most satisfactory outcomes, even when solely AF2 structures are available.

Given the availability of numerous docking programs, there is a pressing need for a systematic evaluation of their performance, specifically on protein-cyclic peptide systems. In this study, we constructed an extensive benchmark data set called CPSet, consisting of 493 protein-cyclic peptide complexes. Based on this data set, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 10 docking programs, including Rosetta, AutoDock CrankPep, and eight protein-small molecule docking programs (i.e., AutoDock, AudoDock Vina, Glide, GOLD, LeDock, rDock, MOE, and Surflex). The evaluation encompassed the assessment of the sampling power, docking power, and scoring power of these programs. The results revealed that all of the tested protein-small molecule docking programs successfully sampled the binding conformations when using the crystal conformations as the initial structures. Among them, rDock exhibited outstanding performance, achieving a remarkable 94.3% top-100 sampling success rate. However, few programs achieved successful predictions of the binding conformations using tLEaP-generated conformations as the initial structures. Within this scheme, AutoDock CrankPep yielded the highest top-100 sampling success rate of 29.6%. Rosetta's scoring function outperformed the others in selecting optimal conformations, resulting in an impressive top-1 docking success rate of 87.6%. Nevertheless, all the tested scoring functions displayed limited performance in predicting binding affinity, with MOE@Affinity dG exhibiting the highest Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.378.

However, the progress of many DL-assisted synthesis planning (DASP) algorithms has suffered from the lack of reliable automated pathway evaluation tools. As a critical metric for evaluating chemical reactions, accurate prediction of reaction yields helps improve the practicality of DASP algorithms in the real-world scenarios. Currently, accurately predicting yields of interesting reactions still faces numerous challenges, mainly including the absence of high-quality generic reaction yield datasets and robust generic yield predictors. To compensate for the limitations of high-throughput yield datasets, we curated a generic reaction yield dataset containing 12 reaction categories and rich reaction condition information. Subsequently, by utilizing 2 pretraining tasks based on chemical reaction masked language modeling and contrastive learning, we proposed a powerful bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)-based reaction yield predictor named Egret. It achieved comparable or even superior performance to the best previous models on 4 benchmark datasets and established state-of-the-art performance on the newly curated dataset. We found that reaction-condition-based contrastive learning enhances the model's sensitivity to reaction conditions, and Egret is capable of capturing subtle differences between reactions involving identical reactants and products but different reaction conditions. Furthermore, we proposed a new scoring function that incorporated Egret into the evaluation of multistep synthesis routes. Test results showed that yield-incorporated scoring facilitated the prioritization of literature-supported high-yield reaction pathways for target molecules. In addition, through meta-learning strategy, we further improved the reliability of the model's prediction for reaction types with limited data and lower data quality.

Here, we introduce MCGLPPI, a novel geometric representation learning framework that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) with the MARTINI molecular coarse-grained (CG) model to predict overall PPI properties accurately and efficiently. This framework maps proteins onto a concise CG-scale complex graph, where nodes represent CG beads and edges encode chemically plausible interactions. The GNN-based encoder is tailored to extract high-quality representations from this graph, efficiently capturing the overall properties of the protein complex structure. Extensive experiments on three different downstream PPI property prediction tasks demonstrate that MCGLPPI achieves competitive performance compared with the counterparts at the atom- and residue-scale, but with only a third of the computational resource consumption. Furthermore, the CG-scale pre-training on protein domain-domain interaction structures enhances its predictive capabilities for PPI tasks.

Method and Materials  Institutional review board-approved retrospective study, with waiver for informed consent. Contrast-enhanced chest CT performed during 6 months were reviewed for presence of VAMB in venous segments visible in chest CT (subclavian, brachiocephalic vein, superior vena cava) and cardiac chambers. VAMB volumes were quantified through a semiautomatic method (MIAlite plugin for OsiriX), using a region of interest (ROI) covering the bubble. With basal results, protocols for correct injection technique were reinforced, and VAMB were estimated again at 1 and 3 months. Six months later, questionnaires were sent to the CT technologists to inquire about their perception of VAMB. Descriptive measures with central distribution and dispersion were performed; statistical significance was considered at p  < 0.05. Results  A total of 602 chest CTA were analyzed, 332 were women (55.14%), with a median age of 58 (interquartile range [IQR] 44-72) years. Among those, 16.11% (100 cases) presented VAMB. Most were emergency department patients (51.6%), male (50.3%), with a median age of 54 (IQR 26) years. There was no difference on detection of VAMB regarding sex ( p  = 0.19), age ( p  = 0.46), or referral diagnosis ( p  = 0.35). Mean air bubbles volume was 0.2 mL (range 0.01-3.4 mL). After intervention, the number of exams with VAMB dropped to 3.29 % (3/91) ( p  < 0.001). On the 6-month query, 50% of the technicians still considered that VMAB is inevitable, and 60% thought that the occurrence is not associated to risk, and therefore, not actionable. Conclusion  VAMB are a frequent finding in chest CTA, and being independent from patient-related variables, it is likely due to technical issues such as intravenous access manipulation during the exam. Reduction after reinforcement of proper performance, and certification of a low concern from CT technicians for any risk associated, provides evidence that there is normalization of deviance in this everyday procedure.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c1a315a40a2c80de71e36259e908ed39bdfe652,,C.

Our methodology has been validated on several benchmark datasets. The target-specific SFs can achieve an average ROC AUC of 0.973 towards 32 targets and the generic SF can achieve the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.81 on the PDBbind version 2016 core set. To sum up, the ASFP server is a powerful tool for structure-based VS.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f1a8b53f8b5aaf0efbc804ea6001a709193e23d,"An integrated platform called ASFP, a web server for the development of customized SFs for structure-based VS and binding affinity prediction, which has been validated on several benchmark datasets.",X.

Although this feature has been widely used in organometallics to develop homogeneous catalysts, a single-atom heterogeneous analogue has not yet been reported. In this work, we show that a 16-electron complex may act as an important transition state in the CO oxidation over a single Pt atom supported by a MoS2 monolayer (Pt/MoS2). The catalytic oxidation reaction prefers to start with the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) reaction, where the CO and O2 molecules are first co-adsorbed on the Pt atom, then cross a small barrier of 0.40 eV to form a square-planar 16-electron intermediate state, and subsequently the first CO2 is released. The activation barrier of the following Eley–Rideal (E–R) reaction is only 0.23 eV. The superior catalytic reactivity of the Pt/MoS2 surface can be explained by the quantum confinement effect of the Pt-5d orbitals and the stability of the square-planar 16-electron transition state. In addition, MoS2 may serve as a defect-free two dimensional anchoring substrate for Pt atomic adsorption. It provides not only a very large surface-to-volume ratio, but also a well-defined structure with a uniform distribution of anchoring points. The square-planar 16-electron intermediate state of the L–H reaction, together with the new MoS2 anchoring substrate, may provide a new opportunity for the design of single-atom catalysts on two-dimensional surfaces.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1cdebbe17be0a302b98c1f492a935766512d7277,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify novel PI3K inhibitors, we performed a high throughput virtual screen and identified several novel small molecule compounds, including PIK-C98 (C98). The cell-free enzymatic studies showed that C98 inhibited all class I PI3Ks at nano- or low micromolar concentrations but had no effects on AKT or mTOR activity. Molecular docking analysis revealed that C98 interfered with the ATP-binding pockets of PI3Ks by forming H-bonds and arene-H interactions with specific amino acid residues. The cellular assays demonstrated that C98 specifically inhibited PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, but had no effects on other kinases and proteins including IGF-1R, ERK, p38, c-Src, PTEN, and STAT3. Inhibition of PI3K by C98 led to myeloma cell apoptosis. Furthermore, oral administration of C98 delayed tumor growth in two independent human myeloma xenograft models in nude mice but did not show overt toxicity.

However, how GO interacts with bioactive proteins and its potential in enzyme engineering have been rarely explored. In this study, we investigate the interactions between ChT and graphene/GO by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. We find that ChT is adsorbed onto the surface of GO or graphene during 100 ns MD simulations. The α-helix of ChT plays as an important anchor to interact with GO. The cationic and hydrophobic residues of ChT form strong interactions with GO, which leads to the deformation of the active site of ChT and the inhibition of ChT. In comparison, the active site of ChT is only slightly affected after ChT adsorbed onto the graphene surface.

To decipher the binding specificity of PDZ domain, we analyzed the interactions between 11 mouse PDZ domains and 217 [corrected] peptides using a method called MIEC-SVM, which energetically characterizes the domain-peptide interaction using molecular interaction energy components (MIECs) and predicts binding specificity using support vector machine (SVM). Cross-validation and leave-one-domain-out test showed that the MIEC-SVM using all 44 PDZ-peptide residue pairs at the interaction interface outperformed the sequence-based methods in the literature. A further feature (residue pair) selection procedure illustrated that 16 residue pairs were uninformative to the binding specificity, even though they contributed significantly (~50%) to the binding energy. If only using the 28 informative residue pairs, the performance of the MIEC-SVM on predicting the PDZ binding specificity was significantly improved. This analysis suggests that the informative and uninformative residue interactions between the PDZ domain and the peptide may represent those contributing to binding specificity and affinity, respectively. We performed additional structural and energetic analyses to shed light on understanding how the PDZ-peptide recognition is established.

Our previous study suggested that CQ induced cell death and displayed anti-leukemia and anti-myeloma activity (Mao × et al, Leukemia, 2009), but its mechanisms are not well known. In this study, we demonstrated that clioquinol-induced cell death is via intrinsic rather than extrinsic apoptotic pathway, clioquinol-induced apoptosis depends on the activation of caspase-9 and -3. Because zinc is essential for the enzymatic activity of histone deacetylases (HDAC) which is currently emerging as a novel target for apoptotis and cancer treatment, and clioquinol is a strong chelator of zinc ion, we questioned whether clioquinol could interfere with HDAC activity by binding to zinc. Thus, we first examined the effects of clioquinol on the most often used hallmarks for HDAC inhibitions, including cyclin D, p21(CIP1), and p27(KIP1) (Nature Reviews Cancer, 2006). DNA microarray analysis indicated that clioquinol and its analogs significantly up-regulated the transcriptional level of p21 > 2–10 folds within 24 hr. The increased expression of p21(CIP1) protein was further confirmed by western blotting assay in various cell lines and primary patient samples. Clioquinol induced p21(CIP1) expression at concentrations as low as 5 μM witin 24 hr. At the same concentration, tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulator p27 (KIP1) was also increased. In addition, clioquinol also down-regulated expression of D-cyclins, including cyclin D2 and D3 in tested cell lines at a concentration consistent with that induced cell apoptosis. All these changes by clioquinol resulted in cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in both leukemia and myeloma cell lines. Because these genes (cyclin D, p21 and p27) are most associated with histone acetylases, we next checked whether clioquinol is effective in inhibiting HDAC activity. Both leukemia and myeloma cell lines and primary patient samples were applied for the analysis of acetylation status of histone 3 (Ac-H3). Using trichostatin A (TSA) as a positive control, we found that clioquinol accumulated Ac-H3 in all tested cell lines and primary patient samples in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which strongly suggested that clioquinol interfere with HDAC activity. Subsequently, we analyzed the interaction of clioquinol and HDAC. Just like TSA, clioquinol was docked into the active pocket of HDAC, where clioquinol competitively binds to zinc at the active center, which was confirmed by zinc addition. Zinc addition partially abolished the effects of clioquinol on HDAC activity. Thus, our study indicated that clioquinol-induced cell death in both leukemia and myeloma was via an apoptotic pathway by interfering with HDAC activity.

However, the experimental measurement of such an important property is a costly and highly time consuming step of the drug development process because it is necessary to synthesize the compound first. Therefore, in silico modelling of intestinal absorption, which can be carried out at very early stages of drug design, is an appealing alternative procedure which is based mainly on multivariate statistical analysis such as partial least squares (PLS) and neural networks (NN). Our implementation of neural network models for the prediction of intestinal absorption is based on the correlation of Caco-2 cell apparent permeability (P (app)) values, as a measure of intestinal absorption, to the structures of two different data sets of drug candidates. Several molecular descriptors of the compounds were calculated and the optimal subsets were selected using a genetic algorithm; therefore, the method was indicated as Genetic Algorithm-Neural Network (GA-NN). A methodology combining a genetic algorithm search with neural network analysis applied to the modelling of Caco-2 P (app) has never been presented before, although the two procedures have been already employed separately. Moreover, we provide new Caco-2 cell permeability measurements for more than two hundred compounds. Interestingly, the selected descriptors show to possess physico-chemical connotations which are in excellent accordance with the well known relevant molecular properties involved in the cellular membrane permeation phenomenon: hydrophilicity, hydrogen bonding propensity, hydrophobicity and molecular size. The predictive ability of the models, although rather good for a preliminary study, is somewhat affected by the poor precision of the experimental Caco-2 measurements. Finally, the generalization ability of one model was checked on an external test set not derived from the data sets used to build the models.

The final structure of the aqueous simulation at room temperature matches closely the structure obtained by NMR and the experimentally observed protections from isotopic exchange. The comparison of the structures generated by the aqueous simulation at 85 degrees C reveals a trajectory composed of groups of geometrically related structures separated by narrow regions of rapid change in structure. The first of these regions displays changes in backbone rmsd to the crystal structure and solvent-accessible area suggestive of a transition state, while the properties observed during the final 300 ps of the simulation are consistent with a stable intermediate. These assignments were confirmed by calculation of the ""progress along the reaction coordinate"" phi-values using an empirical equation based on a linear response method. The pathway of unfolding defined in this fashion agrees well with the experimental results of site-directed mutagenesis in terms of secondary structure content of the transition state and the intermediate and reproduces the relative stability of the different elements of secondary structure. The results of the simulations in urea suggest a mechanism at the molecular level for its well-known enhancement of the denaturation of proteins.

The displacement of water molecules allows greater exposure of hydrophobic side chains, as witnessed particularly in the analysis of solvent-accessible surface areas at the higher temperature.

IL-11 acts on cells expressing gp130 and the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R) alpha-subunit (IL-11Ralpha). The structural epitopes of IL-11 required for the recruitment of the individual receptor subunits have not yet been defined. Based on the structure of CNTF, a three-dimensional model of human IL-11 was built. Using this model, 10 surface exposed amino acid residues of IL-11 were selected for mutagenesis using analogies to the well-characterized receptor recruitment sites of IL-6, CNTF, and LIF. The respective mutants of human IL-11 were expressed as soluble fusion proteins in bacteria. Their biological activities were determined on HepG2 and Ba/F3-130-11alpha cells. Several mutants with substantially decreased bioactivity and one hyperagonistic mutant were identified and further analyzed with regard to recruitment of IL-11Ralpha and gp130. The low-activity mutant I171D still binds IL-11Ralpha but fails to recruit gp130, whereas the hyperagonistic variant R135E more efficiently engages the IL-11R subunits. The low-activity mutants R190E and L194D failed to bind to IL-11Ralpha. These findings reveal a common mechanism of receptor recruitment in the family of IL-6-type cytokines and offer considerable perspectives for the rational design of IL-11 antagonists and hyperagonists.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2dd078a76183dbac85a3d8a44c6707680765afbe,A molecular model of IL-11 is generated using the X-ray structure of GCSF as a template and the information from the secondary structural prediction of the GOR_II method was taken into account and the validation of the model suggests that the quality of this structure is sound.,I.

We applied this method to four targets (HCV NS3 protease, Cathepsin K, EGFR, and XPO1) with known crystal structures and known covalent inhibitors. We implemented a customized ""VS mode"" of the Schrödinger Covalent Docking algorithm (CovDock), which we refer to as CovDock-VS. Known actives and target-specific sets of decoys were docked to selected X-ray structures, and poses were filtered based on noncovalent protein-ligand interactions known to be important for activity. We were able to retrieve 71%, 72%, and 77% of the known actives for Cathepsin K, HCV NS3 protease, and EGFR within 5% of the decoy library, respectively. With the more challenging XPO1 target, where no specific interactions with the protein could be used for postprocessing of the docking results, we were able to retrieve 95% of the actives within 30% of the decoy library and achieved an early enrichment factor (EF1%) of 33. The poses of the known actives bound to existing crystal structures of 4 targets were predicted with an average RMSD of 1.9 Å. To the best of our knowledge, CovDock-VS is the first fully automated tool for efficient virtual screening of covalent inhibitors. Importantly, CovDock-VS can handle multiple chemical reactions within the same library, only requiring a generic SMARTS-based predefinition of the reaction. CovDock-VS provides a fast and accurate way of differentiating actives from decoys without significantly deteriorating the accuracy of the predicted poses for covalent protein-ligand complexes. Therefore, we propose CovDock-VS as an efficient structure-based virtual screening method for discovery of novel and diverse covalent ligands.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dfac96426501ab4395ce9bd7e1127f2b0e5eca43,,D.

Here, we investigate strategies for applying COMBINE (COMparative BINding Energy) analysis, in conjunction with PIPSA (Protein Interaction Property Similarity Analysis) and ligand docking methods, to address this problem. We evaluate these approaches by application to diverse sets of inhibitors of three structurally related serine proteases of medical relevance: thrombin, trypsin, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). We generated target-specific scoring functions (COMBINE models) for the three targets using training sets of ligands with known inhibition constants and structures of their receptor-ligand complexes. These COMBINE models were compared with the PIPSA results and experimental data on receptor selectivity. These scoring functions highlight the ligand-receptor interactions that are particularly important for binding specificity for the different targets. To predict target selectivity in virtual screening, compounds were docked into the three protein binding sites using the program GOLD and the docking solutions were re-ranked with the target-specific scoring functions and computed electrostatic binding free energies. Limits in the accuracy of some of the docking solutions and difficulties in scoring them adversely affected the predictive ability of the target specific scoring functions. Nevertheless, the target-specific scoring functions enabled the selectivity of ligands to thrombin versus trypsin and uPA to be predicted.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f16ec8da1afa5eb3b3432e14accfc38f805b0d36,The binding affinities of a series of benzamide inhibitors with trypsin were evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations with a linear response approach and the calculated results show the predictive abilities of the two-parameter and three- parameter models are significantly better than the one-parameters model.,S.

Our methodology has been validated on several benchmark datasets. The target-specific SFs can achieve an average ROC AUC of 0.973 towards 32 targets and the generic SF can achieve the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.81 on the PDBbind version 2016 core set.

In this study, based on 11 public datasets covering various property endpoints, the predictive capacity and computational efficiency of the prediction models developed by eight machine learning (ML) algorithms, including four descriptor-based models (SVM, XGBoost, RF and DNN) and four graph-based models (GCN, GAT, MPNN and Attentive FP), were extensively tested and compared. The results demonstrate that on average the descriptor-based models outperform the graph-based models in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. SVM generally achieves the best predictions for the regression tasks. Both RF and XGBoost can achieve reliable predictions for the classification tasks, and some of the graph-based models, such as Attentive FP and GCN, can yield outstanding performance for a fraction of larger or multi-task datasets. In terms of computational cost, XGBoost and RF are the two most efficient algorithms and only need a few seconds to train a model even for a large dataset. The model interpretations by the SHAP method can effectively explore the established domain knowledge for the descriptor-based models. Finally, we explored use of these models for virtual screening (VS) towards HIV and demonstrated that different ML algorithms offer diverse VS profiles.

The key to photocatalysis field is to search materials with suitable oxidizing and reducing potential. Herein we investigated the novel 2D γ-phosphorus nitride (γ-PN) monolayer as a candidate photocatalyst for reducing water into hydrogen and oxygen from the first-principles and molecular dynamics calculations. Our results show that the 2D γ-PN monolayer is an indirect semiconductor whose conduction and valence band edges matches well with the chemical potential of H+/H2 and O2/H2O. Strain effect is considered to tune the electronic properties of γ-PN. The calculation results reveal that tensile strain decreases the band gap and upshifts the work function of the γ-PN monolayer. The γ-PN monolayer at the 10% tensile strain shows the optimal performance in catalysing the water-splitting due to the low band gap and the better absorption spectrum at the UV-visible light range. Furthermore, the molecular dynamics shows that the γ-PN in the aqueous solution always keep stable after 100 ps simulation. Both the density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation reflect that the γ-PN monolayer is reliable and promising as a water-splitting photocatalyst.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e57983c5388f7593c9788c069ede8d4ad1e8c1e9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nucleosides require a specialized class of integral membrane proteins, known as nucleoside transporters (NTs), for specific transport across cell membranes. NTs are also important determinants for the transport of nucleoside-derived drugs across cell membranes. Recently, the crystal structure of the vcCNT (Vibrio cholerae Concentrative Nucleoside Transporter) was reported. Here we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the vcCNT structure in the presence of various sodium gradients, since CNTs are sodium-coupled transporters. The results highlight the important role of sodium bound to the vcCNT in the transport of uridine. Our MD simulations show that, without NaCl, uridine remains stable in the binding pocket of the vcCNT. In the presence of 20 mM NaCl, uridine moves from the binding pocket and approaches the entrance of the intracellular side. In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, uridine passes through most part of the entrance and approaches the intracellular side. The polar/charged amino acids in the binding pocket are important in the transport process. They first ""fix"" the ribose and allow the uracil base of uridine to approach the entrance of the intracellular side, and then ""release"" the ribose to allow uridine to move freely into the intracellular side coupled with the movement of sodium ions and HP1b.

Recently, the discovery of inhibitors that block a single isoform of PI3K has continued to attract special attention because they may have higher selectivity for certain tumors and less toxicity for healthy cells. The PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ share fewer studies than α/γ, and therefore, in this work, the combination of molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations was employed to explore the binding of three isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors (COM8, IC87114, and GDC-0941) to PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ. The isoform specificities of the studied inhibitors derived from the predicted binding free energies are in good agreement with the experimental data. In addition, the key residues critical for PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ selectivity were highlighted by decomposing the binding free energies into the contributions from individual residues. It was observed that although PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ share the conserved ATP-binding pockets, individual residues do behave differently, particularly the residues critical for PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ selectivity. It can be concluded that the inhibitor specificity between PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ is determined by the additive contributions from multiple residues, not just a single one. This study provides valuable information for understanding the isoform-specific binding mechanisms of PI3K inhibitors, and should be useful for the rational design of novel and selective PI3K inhibitors.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6087a321cfedf0b6e0c615e60b3917efba44a497,"It can be concluded that the inhibitor specificity between PI3Kβ andPI3Kδ is determined by the additive contributions from multiple residues, not just a single one, which should be useful for the rational design of novel and selective PI3k inhibitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently available drugs are all type-I inhibitors bound to the ATP-binding pocket and are most likely to be resistant in patients harboring genetic mutations surrounding the ATP pocket. To overcome drug resistance, we rationally designed a novel kind of “bridge” inhibitor, which specially bind into an extended hydrophobic back pocket adjacent to the ATP-binding site of ALK. The novel type-I1/2 inhibitors display excellent antiproliferation activity against ALK-positive cancer cells and appear superior to two clinically used drugs, crizotinib and ceritinib.
