        "abstract": "Despite the resounding clinical success in cancer treatment of antibodies that block the interaction of PD1 with its ligand PDL11, the mechanisms involved remain unknown. A major limitation to understanding the origin and fate of T cells in tumour immunity is the lack of quantitative information on the distribution of individual clonotypes of T cells in patients with cancer. Here, by performing deep single-cell sequencing of RNA and T cell receptors in patients with different types of cancer, we survey the profiles of various populations of T cells and T cell receptors in tumours, normal adjacent tissue, and peripheral blood. We find clear evidence of clonotypic expansion of effector-like T cells not only within the tumour but also in normal adjacent tissue. Patients with gene signatures of such clonotypic expansion respond best to anti-PDL1 therapy. Notably, expanded clonotypes found in the tumour and normal adjacent tissue can also typically be detected in peripheral blood, which suggests a convenient approach to patient identification. Analyses of our data together with several external datasets suggest that intratumoural T cells, especially in responsive patients, are replenished with fresh, non-exhausted replacement cells from sites outside the tumour, suggesting continued activity of the cancer immunity cycle in these patients, the acceleration of which may be associated with clinical response.",

        "abstract": "Because humans are invariably exposed to complex chemical mixtures, estimating the health effects of multi-pollutant exposures is of critical concern in environmental epidemiology, and to regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. However, most health effects studies focus on single agents or consider simple two-way interaction models, in part because we lack the statistical methodology to more realistically capture the complexity of mixed exposures. We introduce Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) as a new approach to study mixtures, in which the health outcome is regressed on a flexible function of the mixture (e.g. air pollution or toxic waste) components that is specified using a kernel function. In high-dimensional settings, a novel hierarchical variable selection approach is incorporated to identify important mixture components and account for the correlated structure of the mixture. Simulation studies demonstrate the success of BKMR in estimating the exposure-response function and in identifying the individual components of the mixture responsible for health effects. We demonstrate the features of the method through epidemiology and toxicology applications.",

Comparisons of these results with full ab initio calculations of the electronic couplings using a supersystem are made, as are comparisons with experimental data. Results show that the transition charges do a good job of reproducing the supersystem couplings for dimers with moderate to long-range interchromophore separation. It is also found that CIS supermolecular couplings tend to overestimate the couplings, and often the transition charges approach may be better, due to fortuitous cancellation of errors.",

GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 A, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 A) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 A, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 A and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 A and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching.",

A quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) study was carried out to predict Caco-2 cell permeability of a large data set consisting of 1272 compounds. Four different methods including multivariate linear regression (MLR), partial least-squares (PLS), support vector machine (SVM) regression and Boosting were employed to build prediction models with 30 molecular descriptors selected by nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The best Boosting model was obtained finally with R(2) = 0.97, RMSEF = 0.12, Q(2) = 0.83, RMSECV = 0.31 for the training set and RT(2) = 0.81, RMSET = 0.31 for the test set. A series of validation methods were used to assess the robustness and predictive ability of our model according to the OECD principles and then define its applicability domain. Compared with the reported QSAR/QSPR models about Caco-2 cell permeability, our model exhibits certain advantage in database size and prediction accuracy to some extent. Finally, we found that the polar volume, the hydrogen bond donor, the surface area and some other descriptors can influence the Caco-2 permeability to some extent. These results suggest that the proposed model is a good tool for predicting the permeability of drug candidates and to perform virtual screening in the early stage of drug development.",

        "abstract": "Metal ions play significant roles in biological systems. Accurate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on these systems require a validated set of parameters. Although there are more detailed ways to model metal ions, the nonbonded model, which employs a 12-6 Lennard-Jones (LJ) term plus an electrostatic potential is still widely used in MD simulations today due to its simple form. However, LJ parameters have limited transferability due to different combining rules, various water models and diverse simulation methods. Recently, simulations employing a Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) treatment for long-range electrostatics have become more and more popular owing to their speed and accuracy. In the present work we have systematically designed LJ parameters for 24 +2 metal (M(II)) cations to reproduce different experimental properties appropriate for the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules and PME simulations. We began by testing the transferability of currently available M(II) ion LJ parameters. The results showed that there are differences between simulations employing Ewald summation with other simulation methods and that it was necessary to design new parameters specific for PME based simulations. Employing the thermodynamic integration (TI) method and performing periodic boundary MD simulations employing PME, allowed for the systematic investigation of the LJ parameter space. Hydration free energies (HFEs), the ion-oxygen distance in the first solvation shell (IOD) and coordination numbers (CNs) were obtained for various combinations of the parameters of the LJ potential for four widely used water models (TIP3P, SPC/E, TIP4P and TIP4PEW). Results showed that the three simulated properties were highly correlated. Meanwhile, M(II) ions with the same parameters in different water models produce remarkably different HFEs but similar structural properties. It is difficult to reproduce various experimental values simultaneously because the nonbonded model underestimates the interaction between the metal ions and water molecules at short range. Moreover, the extent of underestimation increases successively for the TIP3P, SPC/E, TIP4PEW and TIP4P water models. Nonetheless, we fitted a curve to describe the relationship between ε (the well depth) and radius (Rmin/2) from experimental data on noble gases to facilitate the generation of the best possible compromise models. Hence, by targeting different experimental values, we developed three sets of parameters for M(II) cations for three different water models (TIP3P, SPC/E and TIP4PEW). These parameters we feel represent the best possible compromise that can be achieved using the nonbonded model for the ions in combination with simple water models. From a computational uncertainty analysis we estimate that the uncertainty in our computed HFEs is on the order of ±1kcal/mol. Further improvements will require more advanced non-bonded models likely with inclusion of polarization.",

Hashimoto thyroiditis is the commonest cause of goitre in iodine-sufficient regions.[1] The aetiology of Hashimoto disease is very poorly understood. Most patients develop antibodies to a variety of thyroid antigens, the most common of which is&nbsp;anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO). Many also form antithyroglobulin (anti-Tg) and TSH receptor blocking antibodies (TBII). These antibodies attack the thyroid tissue, eventually leading to inadequate production of thyroid hormone. There is a small subset of the population, around 10-15% with the clinically evident disease, that are serum antibody-negative.[2][3] The mechanisms underlying the assumption that vitamin D is linked with autoimmunity are not clear but probably are associated with its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions. The dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells originating from bone marrow and also a primary target for the immunomodulatory activity of vitamin D. 1,25[OH]2D has direct immunomodulatory effects at the level of the T cell vitamin D receptor. Together, these immunomodulatory effects can lead to the protection of target tissues, such as thyroid cells in autoimmune diseases. Considering that in HT, a disorder of T cell-mediated immunity, immunologic attack is triggered when thyrocytes express MHC class II surface HLA-DR antigens, a process induced by the production of Th1 type inflammatory cytokines (especially IFN-γ). Moreover, at another stage, after being activated by T cells, B cells' ongoing proliferation might be inhibited and apoptosis might be induced by 1,25[OH]2D. Thus, 1,25[OH]2D might decrease antibodies that react with thyroid antigens. The exact levels of vitamin D that are sufficient to improve the immune regulatory function and lead to an effective immune response, should be investigated. Several clinical studies have reported a low vitamin D status in AITD or HT, indicating an association between vitamin D deficiency and thyroid autoimmunity. If supplementation of the Vitamin D decreased thyroid antibody titres in Vitamin D deficient subjects, in the future Vitamin D may become a part of AITDs' treatment, especially in those with Vitamin D deficiency. [4] So, our study tries to assess any potential therapeutic role of vitamin D in the management of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",

Particularly, we emphasize the similarities among the different methods that can be considered as variants of the multibody expansion technique. Nevertheless, on the basis of thermochemical arguments, we propose yet another variant of the fragment energy methods, which could be useful for, and readily applicable to, biomolecules using either QM or hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics methods. The proposed computational scheme is applied to investigate the stability of a triple-helical collagen model peptide. To better address the actual applicability of the fragment QM method and to properly compare with experimental data, we compute average energies by carrying out single-point fragment QM calculations on structures generated by a classical molecular dynamics simulation. The QM calculations are done using a density functional level of theory combined with an implicit solvent model. Other free-energy terms such as attractive dispersion interactions or thermal contributions are included using molecular mechanics. The importance of correcting both the intermolecular and intramolecular basis set superposition error (BSSE) in the QM calculations is also discussed in detail. On the basis of the favorable comparison of our fragment-based energies with experimental data and former theoretical results, we conclude that the fragment QM energy strategy could be an interesting addition to the multimethod toolbox for biomolecular simulations in order to investigate those situations (e.g., interactions with metal clusters) that are beyond the range of applicability of common molecular mechanics methods.",

The 12-6 Lennard-Jones (LJ) nonbonded model is widely used to model monovalent ions in classical molecular dynamics simulations. A lot of parameterization efforts have been reported for these ions with a number of experimental end points. However, some reported parameter sets do not have a good balance between the two Lennard-Jones parameters (the van der Waals (VDW) radius and potential well depth), which affects their transferability. In the present work, via the use of a noble gas curve we fitted in former work (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2013, 9, 2733), we reoptimized the 12-6 LJ parameters for 15 monovalent ions (11 positive and 4 negative ions) for three extensively used water models (TIP3P, SPC/E, and TIP4P(EW)). Since the 12-6 LJ nonbonded model performs poorly in some instances for these ions, we have also parameterized the 12-6-4 LJ-type nonbonded model (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2014, 10, 289) using the same three water models. The three derived parameter sets focused on reproducing the hydration free energies (the HFE set) and the ion-oxygen distance (the IOD set) using the 12-6 LJ nonbonded model and the 12-6-4 LJ-type nonbonded model (the 12-6-4 set) overall give improved results. In particular, the final parameter sets showed better agreement with quantum mechanically calculated VDW radii and improved transferability to ion-pair solutions when compared to previous parameter sets.",

        "abstract": "Computational chemists have long demonstrated great interest in finding ways to reliably and accurately predict the molecular properties for transition-metal-containing complexes. This study is a continuation of our validation efforts of density functional theory (DFT) methods when applied to transition-metal-containing systems (Riley, K.E.; Merz, K. M., Jr. J. Phys. Chem. 2007, 111, 6044-6053). In our previous work we examined DFT using all-electron basis sets, but approaches incorporating effective core potentials (ECPs) are effective in reducing computational expense. With this in mind, our efforts were expanded to include evaluation of the performance of the basis set derived to approximate such an approach as well on the same set of density functionals. Indeed, employing an ECP basis such as LANL2DZ (Los Alamos National Laboratory 2 double zeta) for transition metals, while using all-electron basis sets for all other non-transition-metal atoms, has become more and more popular in computations on transition-metal-containing systems. In this study, we assess the performance of 12 different DFT functionals, from the GGA (generalized gradient approximation), hybrid-GGA, meta-GGA, and hybrid-meta-GGA classes, respectively, along with the 6-31+G** + LANL2DZ (on the transition metal) mixed basis set in predicting two important molecular properties, heats of formation and ionization potentials, for 94 and 58 systems containing first-row transition metals from Ti to Zn, which are all in the third row of the periodic table. An interesting note is that the inclusion of the exact exchange term in density functional methods generally increases the accuracy of ionization potential prediction for the hybrid-GGA methods but decreases the reliability of determining the heats of formation for transition-metal-containing complexes for all hybrid density functional methods. The hybrid-GGA functional B3LYP gives the best performance in predicting the ionization potentials, while the meta-GGA functional TPSSTPSS provides the most reliable and accurate results for heat of formation calculations. TPSSTPSS, a meta-GGA functional, which was constructed from first principles and subject to known exact constraints just like in an \"ab initio\" way, is successful in predicting both the ionization potentials and the heats of formation for transition-metal-containing systems.",

        "abstract": "Metal ions exist in almost half of the proteins in the protein databank and they serve as structural, electron-transfer and catalytic elements in the metabolic processes of organisms. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation is a powerful tool that provides information about biomolecular systems at the atomic level. Coupled with the growth in computing power, algorithms like the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method have become the accepted standard when dealing with long-range interactions in MD simulations. The nonbonded model of metal ions consists of an electrostatic plus 12-6 Lennard Jones (LJ) potential and is used largely because of its speed relative to more accurate models. In previous work we found that ideal parameters do not exist that reproduce several experimental properties for M(II) ions simultaneously using the nonbonded model coupled with the PME method due to the underestimation of metal ion-ligand interactions. Via a consideration of the nature of the nonbonded model, we proposed that the observed error largely arises from overlooking charge-induced dipole interactions. The electrostatic plus 12-6 LJ potential model works reasonably well for neutral systems but does struggle with more highly charged systems. In the present work we designed and parameterized a new nonbonded model for metal ions by adding a 1/r4 term to the 12-6 model. We call it the 12-6-4 LJ-type nonbonded model due to its mathematical construction. Parameters were determined for 16 +2 metal ions for the TIP3P, SPC/E and TIP4PEW water models. The final parameters reproduce the experimental hydration free energies (HFE), ion-oxygen distances (IOD) in the first solvation shell and coordination numbers (CN) accurately for the metal ions investigated. Preliminary tests on MgCl2 at different concentrations in aqueous solution and Mg2+--nucleic acid systems show reasonable results suggesting that the present parameters can work in mixed systems. The 12-6-4 LJ-type nonbonded model is readily adopted into standard force fields like AMBER, CHARMM and OPLS-AA with only a modest computational overhead. The new nonbonded model doesn't consider charge-transfer effects explicitly and, hence, may not suitable for the simulation of systems where charge-transfer effects play a decisive role.",

        "title": "Metal ion modeling using classical mechanics",
        "abstract": "Metal ions play significant roles in numerous fields including chemistry, geochemistry, biochemistry, and materials science. With computational tools increasingly becoming important in chemical research, methods have emerged to effectively face the challenge of modeling metal ions in the gas, aqueous, and solid phases. Herein, we review both quantum and classical modeling strategies for metal ion-containing systems that have been developed over the past few decades. This Review focuses on classical metal ion modeling based on unpolarized models (including the nonbonded, bonded, cationic dummy atom, and combined models), polarizable models (e.g., the fluctuating charge, Drude oscillator, and the induced dipole models), the angular overlap model, and valence bond-based models. Quantum mechanical studies of metal ion-containing systems at the semiempirical, ab initio, and density functional levels of theory are reviewed as well with a particular focus on how these methods inform classical modeling efforts. Finally, conclusions and future prospects and directions are offered that will further enhance the classical modeling of metal ion-containing systems.",

        "title": "Parameterization of highly charged metal ions using the 12-6-4 LJ-type nonbonded model in explicit water",
        "abstract": "Highly charged metal ions act as catalytic centers and structural elements in a broad range of chemical complexes. The nonbonded model for metal ions is extensively used in molecular simulations due to its simple form, computational speed, and transferability. We have proposed and parametrized a 12-6-4 LJ (Lennard-Jones)-type nonbonded model for divalent metal ions in previous work, which showed a marked improvement over the 12-6 LJ nonbonded model. In the present study, by treating the experimental hydration free energies and ion-oxygen distances of the first solvation shell as targets for our parametrization, we evaluated 12-6 LJ parameters for 18 M(III) and 6 M(IV) metal ions for three widely used water models (TIP3P, SPC/E, and TIP4PEW). As expected, the interaction energy underestimation of the 12-6 LJ nonbonded model increases dramatically for the highly charged metal ions. We then parametrized the 12-6-4 LJ-type nonbonded model for these metal ions with the three water models. The final parameters reproduced the target values with good accuracy, which is consistent with our previous experience using this potential. Finally, tests were performed on a protein system, and the obtained results validate the transferability of these nonbonded model parameters.",

        "abstract": "The dimeric dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), metalloenzyme, an adjunct anti-cancer drug target, contains highly specialized 4 × Fe2+4S2-4 clusters per chain. These clusters facilitate the catalysis of the rate-limiting step in the pyrimidine degradation pathway through a harmonized electron transfer cascade that triggers a redox catabolic reaction. In the process, the bulk of the administered 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cancer drug is inactivated, while a small proportion is activated to nucleic acid antimetabolites. The occurrence of missense mutations in DPD protein within the general population, including those of African descent, has adverse toxicity effects due to altered 5-FU metabolism. Thus, deciphering mutation effects on protein structure and function is vital, especially for precision medicine purposes. We previously proposed combining molecular dynamics (MD) and dynamic residue network (DRN) analysis to decipher the molecular mechanisms of missense mutations in other proteins. However, the presence of Fe2+4S2-4 clusters in DPD poses a challenge for such in silico studies. The existing AMBER force field parameters cannot accurately describe the Fe2+ center coordination exhibited by this enzyme. Therefore, this study aimed to derive AMBER force field parameters for DPD enzyme Fe2+ centers, using the original Seminario method and the collation features Visual Force Field Derivation Toolkit as a supportive approach. All-atom MD simulations were performed to validate the results. Both approaches generated similar force field parameters, which accurately described the human DPD protein Fe2+4S2-4 cluster architecture. This information is crucial and opens new avenues for in silico cancer pharmacogenomics and drug discovery related research on 5-FU drug efficacy and toxicity issues.",

        "abstract": "Expansion of the genetic code allows unnatural amino acids (Uaas) to be site-specifically incorporated into proteins in live biological systems, thus enabling novel properties selectively introduced into target proteins in vivo for basic biological studies and for engineering of novel biological functions. Orthogonal components including tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) are expressed in live cells to decode a unique codon (often the amber stop codon UAG) as the desired Uaa. Initially developed in E. coli, this methodology has now been expanded in multiple eukaryotic cells and animals. In this Account, we focus on addressing various biological challenges for rewriting the genetic code, describing impacts of code expansion on cell physiology and discussing implications for fundamental studies of code evolution. Specifically, a general method using the type-3 polymerase III promoter was developed to efficiently express prokaryotic tRNAs as orthogonal tRNAs and a transfer strategy was devised to generate Uaa-specific aaRS for use in eukaryotic cells and animals. The aaRSs have been found to be highly amenable for engineering substrate specificity toward Uaas that are structurally far deviating from the native amino acid, dramatically increasing the stereochemical diversity of Uaas accessible. Preparation of the Uaa in ester or dipeptide format markedly increases the bioavailability of Uaas to cells and animals. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), an mRNA surveillance mechanism of eukaryotic cells, degrades mRNA containing a premature stop codon. Inhibition of NMD increases Uaa incorporation efficiency in yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans. In bacteria, release factor one (RF1) competes with the orthogonal tRNA for the amber stop codon to terminate protein translation, leading to low Uaa incorporation efficiency. Contradictory to the paradigm that RF1 is essential, it is discovered that RF1 is actually nonessential in E. coli. Knockout of RF1 dramatically increases Uaa incorporation efficiency and enables Uaa incorporation at multiple sites, making it feasible to use Uaa for directed evolution. Using these strategies, the genetic code has been effectively expanded in yeast, mammalian cells, stem cells, worms, fruit flies, zebrafish, and mice. It is also intriguing to find out that the legitimate UAG codons terminating endogenous genes are not efficiently suppressed by the orthogonal tRNA/aaRS in E. coli. Moreover, E. coli responds to amber suppression pressure promptly using transposon insertion to inactivate the introduced orthogonal aaRS. Persistent amber suppression evading transposon inactivation leads to global proteomic changes with a notable up-regulation of a previously uncharacterized protein YdiI, for which an unexpected function of expelling plasmids is discovered. Genome integration of the orthogonal tRNA/aaRS in mice results in minor changes in RNA transcripts but no significant physiological impairment. Lastly, the RF1 knockout E. coli strains afford a previously unavailable model organism for studying otherwise intractable questions on code evolution in real time in the laboratory. We expect that genetically encoding Uaas in live systems will continue to unfold new questions and directions for studying biology in vivo, investigating the code itself, and reprograming genomes for synthetic biology.",

        "abstract": "A linear-scaling semiempirical method, LocalSCF, has been proposed for the quantum-chemical calculations of ultralarge molecular systems by treating the large-scale molecular task as a variational problem. The method resolves the self-consistent field task through the finite atomic expansion of weakly nonorthogonal localized molecular orbitals. The inverse overlap matrix arising from the nonorthogonality of the localized orbitals is approximated by preserving the first-order perturbation term and applying the second-order correction by means of a penalty function. This allows for the separation of the orbital expansion procedure from the self-consistent field optimization of linear coefficients, thereby maintaining the localized molecular orbital size unchanged during the refinement of linear coefficients. Orbital normalization is preserved analytically by the variation of virtual degrees of freedom, which are orthogonal to the initial orbitals. Optimization of linear coefficients of localized orbitals is performed by a gradient procedure. The computer program running on a commodity personal computer was applied to the GroEL-GroES chaperonin complex containing 119,273 atoms.",

        "abstract": "\"Fail early and fail fast\" is the current paradigm that the pharmaceutical industry has adopted widely. Removing non-drug-like compounds from the drug discovery lifecycle in the early stages can lead to tremendous savings of resources. Thus, fast screening methods are needed to profile the large collection of synthesized and virtual libraries involved in the early stage. Solubility is one of the filters that are applied extensively to ensure that the compounds are reasonably soluble so that synthesis of the compounds and assay studies of pharmacokinetics and toxicity are feasible. To address this need, we have developed a fast quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model for the prediction of aqueous solubility (at 298 K, unbuffered solution) from the molecular structures. Multiple linear regressions and genetic algorithms were used to develop the models. The model was based on a set of diverse compounds including small organic molecules and drug and drug-like species. The predicted solubility for the training and test sets agrees well with the experimental values. The coefficient of determination is R(2) = 0.84 for the training set of 775 compounds and the RMS error = 0.87. This model was validated on four sets of compounds. The RMS error for the 1665 compounds from the four validation data sets (including compounds from the Physician's Desk References and Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry databases) is 1 log unit and the unsigned error is 0.77. This model does not require 3-D structure generation which is rather time-consuming. Using 2-D structure as input, this model is able to compute solubility for 90 000-700 000 compounds/h on a SGI Origin 2000 workstation. This kind of fast calculation allows the model to be used in data mining and screening of large synthesized or virtual libraries.",

Despite the omnipresence of these assemblies, a number of questions about the correlations between the organisation of domains and the biomechanical properties of the involved proteins, namely their length, flexibility and affinity, as well as about the coupling to the elastic, fluctuating membrane, remain open. Here we address these issues by developing an effective Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation to model membrane adhesion. We apply this model to a typical experiment in which a cell binds to a functionalized solid supported bilayer and use two ligand-receptor pairs to study these couplings. We find that differences in affinity and length of proteins forming adhesive contacts result in several characteristic features in the calculated phase diagrams. One such feature is mixed states occurring even with proteins with length differences of 10 nm. Another feature are stable nanodomains with segregated proteins appearing on time scales of cell experiments, and for biologically relevant parameters. Furthermore, we show that macroscopic ring-like patterns can spontaneously form as a consequence of emergent protein fluxes. The capacity to form domains is captured by an order parameter that is founded on the virial coefficients for the membrane mediated interactions between bonds, which allow us to collapse all the data. These findings show that taking into account the role of the membrane allows us to recover a number of experimentally observed patterns. This is an important perspective in the context of explicit biological systems, which can now be studied in significant detail.",

In this study, the CMAP method was used to correct the φ/ψ distributions of disorder-promoting amino acids. The simulation results show that the force filed parameters (ff14IDPs) can improve the φ/ψ distributions of the disorder-promoting amino acids, with RMSD less than 0.10% relative to the benchmark data of intrinsically disordered proteins. Further test suggests that the calculated secondary chemical shifts under ff14IDPs are in quantitative agreement with the data of NMR experiment for five tested systems. In addition, the simulation results show that ff14IDPs can still be used to model structural proteins, such as tested lysozyme and ubiquitin, with better performance in coil regions than the original general Amber force field ff14SB.

Methods: Recreationally active men (26.5 ± 6.4 years, 181 ± 6.8 cm, 86.9 ± 12.5 kg, 24.5 ± 6.6% fat) were randomized in a double-blind fashion to placebo (PLA, n = 19) or 500 mg/d Sensoril® (S500, n = 19). Body composition (DEXA), muscular strength, power, and endurance, 7.5 km cycling time trial, and clinical blood chemistries were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of supplementation and training. Subjects were required to maintain their normal dietary habits and to follow a specific, progressive overload resistance-training program (4-day/week, upper body/lower body split). 2 × 2 mixed factorial ANOVA was used for analysis and statistical significance was set a priori at p ≤ 0.05. Results: Gains in 1-RM squat (S500: +19.1 ± 13.0 kg vs. PLA +10.0 ± 6.2 kg, p = 0.009) and bench press (S500: +12.8 ± 8.2 kg vs. PLA: +8.0 ± 6.0 kg, p = 0.048) were significantly greater in S500.

        "abstract": "the development of a new approximate method of calculating molecular surface areas. Our technique is based upon the method of Sharake and Rupley but incorporates several major advances. First, we represent the state of surface points as bits in a bit string so we can utilize Boolean operations to simultaneously turn off multiple test points in one Boolean AND operation. Second, we use a series of Boolean mask look‐up tables to reduce the time complexity of the calculation of molecular surface area down to the same magnitude as doing a potential energy evaluation. When we use a 256 surface point sphere for all of the atoms in BPTI, a 454 nonhydrogen atom protein, and a 1.4‐Å solvent probe, we in general underestimate the total solvent‐accessible surface area (SASA) by approximately 1.25% with a correlation coefficient of 0.9990 over a wide range of conformations. The average CPU time required to calculate the SASA of a BPTI conformer is 0.58 s on an SGI 4D/220 workstation. We also describe a method by which we can calculate an approximate finite difference SASA gradient for BPTI in 0.79 of CPU time. © 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

We present a detailed analysis of the systematic and random errors present in computational methods through the use of error probability density functions, specifically for computed interaction energies between chemical fragments comprising a protein-ligand complex. An HIV-II protease crystal structure with a bound ligand (indinavir) was chosen as a model protein-ligand complex. The complex was decomposed into twenty-one (21) interacting fragment pairs, which were studied using a number of computational methods. The chemically accurate complete basis set coupled cluster theory (CCSD(T)/CBS) interaction energies were used as reference values to generate our error estimates. In our analysis we observed significant systematic and random errors in most methods, which was surprising especially for parameterized classical and semiempirical quantum mechanical calculations. After propagating these fragment-based error estimates over the entire protein-ligand complex, our total error estimates for many methods are large compared to the experimentally determined free energy of binding. Thus, we conclude that statistical error analysis is a necessary addition to any scoring function attempting to produce reliable binding affinity predictions.",

Compared with recent successes of deep learning, classical predictive methods lag behind in their accuracy for the prediction of stable conformations. Therefore, in this work we extended the evolutionary algorithm USPEX to predict protein structure based on global optimization starting with the amino acid sequence. Moreover, we compared frequently used force fields for the task of protein structure prediction. Protein structure relaxation and energy calculations were performed using Tinker (with several different force fields) and Rosetta (with REF2015 force field) codes. To create new protein structure models in the USPEX algorithm, we developed novel variation operators. The test of the new method on seven proteins having (for simplicity) no cis-proline (with ω ≈ 0°) residues, and a length of up to 100 residues, revealed that our algorithm predicts tertiary structures of proteins with high accuracy. The comparison of the final potential energies of the predicted protein structures obtained using the USPEX and the Rosetta Abinitio approach showed that in most cases the developed algorithm found structures with close or even lower energy (Amber/Charmm/Oplsaal) and scoring function (REF2015). While USPEX has clearly demonstrated its ability to find very deep energy minima, our study showed that the existing force fields are not sufficiently accurate for accurate blind prediction of protein structures without further experimental verification.",

The model compounds were chosen to be monomers or glycosidic-linked dimers of tetrahydropyran (THP) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as to contain the key atoms in full carbohydrates. Target data for optimization included two-dimensional quantum mechanical (QM) potential energy scans of the Φ/Ψ glycosidic dihedral angles, with geometry optimization at the MP2/6-31G(d) level followed by MP2/cc-pVTZ single-point energies. All possible chiralities of the model compounds at the linkage carbons were considered, and for each geometry, the THF ring was constrained to the favorable south or north conformations. Target data also included QM vibrational frequencies and pair interaction energies and distances with water molecules. Force field validation included comparison of computed crystal properties, aqueous solution densities, and NMR J-coupling constants to experimental reference values. Simulations of infinite crystals showed good agreement with experimental values for intramolecular geometries as well as for crystal unit cell parameters. Additionally, aqueous solution densities and available NMR data were reproduced to a high degree of accuracy, thus validating the hierarchically optimized parameters in both crystalline and aqueous condensed phases. The newly developed parameters allow for the modeling of linear, branched, and cyclic pyranose/furanose polysaccharides both alone and in heterogeneous systems including proteins, nucleic acids, and/or lipids when combined with existing additive CHARMM biomolecular force fields.",

Segmental order parameters, electron density profiles, and water pair distribution functions have been calculated. Comparison to experiment is made where possible. The dynamics of the system has been studied by analyzing the velocity autocorrelation functions (VAF) of both water and lipid atoms. Furthermore, the diffusive properties of water have been analyzed by computing the mean square displacement (MSD) and orientational correlation function (OCF) of water in two regions around the bilayer. The calculated order parameters show a behavior similar to the liquid crystalline phase of other bilayers, but the region around C1-C3 does not show the expected behavior. The electron density profile shows features that are characteristic of the liquid crystalline phase. The radial distribution functions suggest ordering of water near the charged head groups, which results in about 15 water molecules solvating each lipid molecule. We find from the VAF, MSD, and OCF calculation that the water molecules near the head groups of the lipid bilayer move more slowly than those further away. The VAF of the hydrocarbon chains have features of low-frequency motions that are probably cooperative nature in addition to the high-frequency motions associated with bond angle and torsional motions.",

Standard HF calculations solve the Roothaan-Hall equations for the whole system; in the DC-HF approach, the diagonalization of the Fock matrix is carried out on smaller subsystems. The DC algorithm for HF calculations was validated on polyglycines, polyalanines and eleven real three-dimensional proteins of up to 608 atoms in this work.

        "abstract": "We have studied the winter flounder antifreeze protein (AFP) and two of its mutants using molecular dynamics simulation techniques. The simulations were performed under four conditions: in the gas phase, solvated by water, adsorbed on the ice (2021) crystal plane in the gas phase and in aqueous solution. This study provided details of the ice-binding pattern of the winter flounder AFP. Simulation results indicated that the Asp, Asn, and Thr residues in the AFP are important in ice binding and that Asn and Thr as a group bind cooperatively to the ice surface. These ice-binding residues can be collected into four distinct ice-binding regions: Asp-1/Thr-2/Asp-5, Thr-13/Asn-16, Thr-24/Asn-27, and Thr-35/Arg-37. These four regions are 11 residues apart and the repeat distance between them matches the ice lattice constant along the (1102) direction. This match is crucial to ensure that all four groups can interact with the ice surface simultaneously, thereby, enhancing ice binding. These Asx (x = p or n)/Thr regions each form 5-6 hydrogen bonds with the ice surface: Asn forms about three hydrogen bonds with ice molecules located in the step region while Thr forms one to two hydrogen bonds with the ice molecules in the ridge of the (2021) crystal plane. Both the distance between Thr and Asn and the ordering of the two residues are crucial for effective ice binding. The proper sequence is necessary to generate a binding surface that is compatible with the ice surface topology, thus providing a perfect \"host/guest\" interaction that simultaneously satisfies both hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. The results also show the relation among binding energy, the number of hydrogen bonds, and the activity. The activity is correlated to the binding energy, and in the case of the mutants we have studied the number of hydrogen bonds. The greater the number of the hydrogen bonds the greater the antifreeze activity. The roles van der Waals interactions and the hydrophobic effect play in ice binding are also highlighted. For the latter it is demonstrated that the surface of ice has a clathratelike structure which favors the partitioning of hydrophobic groups to the surface of ice. It is suggested that mutations that involve the deletion of hydrophobic residues (e.g., the Leu residues) will provide insight into the role the hydrophobic effect plays in partitioning these peptides to the surface of ice.",

        "title": "Density functional transition states of organic and organometallic reactions",
        "abstract": "Homogeneous metal-mediated organometallic reactions represent a very large and diverse reaction class. Density functional theory calculations are now routinely carried out and reported for analyzing organometallic mechanisms and reaction pathways. While density functional theory calculations are extremely powerful to understand the energy and structure of organometallic reactions, there are several assumptions in their use and interpretation to define reaction mechanisms and to analyze reaction selectivity. Almost always it is assumed that potential energy structures calculated with density functional theory adequately describe mechanisms and selectivity within the framework of statistical theories, for example, transition state theory and RRKM theory. However, these static structures and corresponding energy landscapes do not provide atomic motion information during reactions that could reveal nonstatistical intermediates without complete intramolecular vibrational redistribution and nonintrinsic reaction coordinate (non-IRC) pathways. While nonstatistical intermediates and non-IRC reaction pathways are now relatively well established for organic reactions, these dynamic effects have heretofore been highly underexplored in organometallic reactions. Through a series of quasiclassical density functional theory direct dynamics trajectory studies, my group has recently demonstrated that dynamic effects occur in a variety of fundamental organometallic reactions, especially bond activation reactions. For example, in the C-H activation reaction between methane and [Cp*(PMe3)IrIII(CH3)]+, while the density functional theory energy landscape showed a two-step oxidative cleavage and reductive coupling mechanism, trajectories revealed a mixture of this two-step mechanism and a dynamic one-step mechanism that skipped the [Cp*(PMe3)IrV(H)(CH3)2]+ intermediate. This study also showed that despite a methane σ-complex being located on the density functional theory surface before oxidative cleavage and after reductive coupling, this intermediate is always skipped and should not be considered an intermediate during reactive trajectories. For non-IRC reaction pathways, quasiclassical direct dynamics trajectories showed that for the isomerization of [Tp(NO)(PMe3)W(η2-benzene)] to [Tp(NO)(PMe3)W(H)(Ph)], there are many dynamic reaction pathway connections due to a relatively flat energy landscape and π coordination is not necessary for C-H bond activation through oxidative cleavage. Trajectories also showed that dynamic effects are important in selectivity for ethylene C-H activation versus π coordination in reaction with Cp(PMe3)2Re, and trajectories provide a more quantitative model of selectivity than transition state theory. Quasiclassical trajectories examining Au-catalyzed monoallylic diol cyclizations showed dynamic coupling of several reaction steps that include alkoxylation π bond addition, proton shuttling, and water elimination reaction steps. Overall, these studies highlight the need to use direct dynamics trajectory simulations to consider atomic motion during reactions to understand organometallic reaction mechanisms and selectivity.",

In the original definition of quantum crystallography (QCr) given by Massa, Karle and Huang, direct extraction of wavefunctions or density matrices from measured intensities of reflections or, conversely, ad hoc quantum mechanical calculations to enhance the accuracy of the crystallographic refinement are implicated. Nevertheless, many other active and emerging research areas involving quantum mechanics and scattering experiments are not covered by the original definition although they enable to observe and explain quantum phenomena as accurately and successfully as the original strategies. Therefore, we give an overview over current research that is related to a broader notion of QCr, and discuss options how QCr can evolve to become a complete and independent domain of natural sciences. The goal of this paper is to initiate discussions around QCr, but not to find a final definition of the field.",

Recently, four new water models (OPC3, OPC, TIP3P-FB, and TIP4P-FB), with significantly improved descriptions of condensed phase water, have been developed. The pairwise interaction between the metal ion and water necessitates the development of ion parameters specifically for these water models. Herein, we parameterized the 12-6 and the 12-6-4 nonbonded models for 12 monovalent ions with the respective four new water models. These monovalent ions contain eight cations including alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+), transition-metal ions (Cu+ and Ag+), and Tl+ from the boron family, along with four halide anions (F-, Cl-, Br-, I-). Our parameters were designed to reproduce the target hydration free energies (the 12-6 hydration free energy (HFE) set), the ion-oxygen distances (the 12-6 ion-oxygen distance (IOD) set), or both of them (the 12-6-4 set). The 12-6-4 parameter set provides highly accurate structural features overcoming the limitations of the routinely used 12-6 nonbonded model for ions. Specifically, we note that the 12-6-4 parameter set is able to reproduce experimental hydration free energies within 1 kcal/mol and experimental ion-oxygen distances within 0.01 Å simultaneously. We further reproduced the experimentally determined activity derivatives for salt solutions, validating the ion parameters for simulations of ion pairs. The improved performance of the present water models over our previous parameter sets for the TIP3P, TIP4P, and SPC/E water models (Li, P. et al J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2015 11 1645 1657) highlights the importance of the choice of water model in conjunction with the metal ion parameter set.",

However, from the results of molecular dynamics simulations (MD) we are able to better define its function. From computer graphics analysis and MD simulations on the zinc hydroxide form of human carbonic anhydrase II we find that this interaction forces the hydroxide hydrogen atom to be in a \"down\" position relative to the deep water-binding pocket. From previous work we have found that this pocket is a high-affinity binding site for CO2. We also note that during the timescale of our simulation (126 ps) the hydrogen bonds between the hydroxide hydrogen atom and Thr199 and the one between Thr199 and Glu106 are not fluxional. We propose that the role of the zinc hydroxide (water)-Thr199-Glu106 hydrogen bond network is to lock the hydrogen atom in the down position in order to expose the CO2 molecule bound in the deep water pocket to a lone pair of the hydroxide oxygen atom. This would allow for the rapid reaction of the CO2 molecule around the zinc ion. Furthermore, if the hydroxide hydrogen atom were not locked in the down position the binding of CO2 to the deep water pocket could be interfered with by the unrestrained hydroxide hydrogen atom (e.g. the N-Zn-O-H torsion could undergo rotational transitions that would partially block the deep water pocket). In summary, the roles we ascribe to this hydrogen bonding network are (1) to allow for facile access of CO2 to the deep water pocket and (2) to allow for maximal exposure of a hydroxide oxygen lone pair to the CO2 carbon atom.",

All six compounds are organic salts, with proton transfer occurring to the Nimino atom of the pyridine ring. Experimental results are then complemented with Hirshfeld surface analysis to quantitively evaluate the contribution of different intermolecular interactions in the crystal packing. Furthermore, theoretical calculations, based on different arrangements of molecules extracted from the crystal structure determinations, are carried out to analyze the formation mechanism of halogen bonds (XBs) in these compounds and provide insights into the nature and strength of the observed interactions. The results show that the supramolecular architectures of the six molecular salts involve extensive classical intermolecular hydrogen bonds.

Background: The demand for minimally invasive cosmetic procedures to address skin aging has grown throughout the world. In vitro red and amber photobiomodulation (PBM) has been shown to improve collagen synthesis. Meanwhile, red PBM has already been studied in clinical trials; however, a comparison of the use of different wavelengths at the same light dose to reduce periocular wrinkles has not yet been performed. Methods: This split-face, randomized clinical trial recruited 137 women (40-65 years old) presenting with skin phototypes II-IV and Glogau photoaging scale types II-IV. The individuals received 10 sessions for 4 weeks of red (660 nm) and amber (590 nm) PBM (3.8 J/cm2), one at each side of the face. The outcomes, measured before and after the treatments, were the periocular wrinkle volume measured by VisioFace® RD equipment; hydration measured by the Corneometer CM 825; skin elasticity measured by the Cutometer Dual MPA 580; and quality of life determined by adapted versions of validated questionnaires [Melasma Quality of Life Scale-Brazilian Portuguese (MelasQoL-BP) and Skindex-29]. Results: There was a significant reduction in wrinkle volume after red (31.6%) and amber (29.9%) PBM. None of the treatments improved skin hydration and viscoelasticity. Both questionnaires showed improvements in participants' quality of life. Conclusions: PBM, both at red and amber wavelengths, is an effective tool for rejuvenation, producing a 30% wrinkle volume reduction. The technique has strong potential in patients with diabetes or those presenting with keloids, conditions for which highly inflammatory rejuvenating procedures are not indicated.

The enthalpy and entropy of activation for kcat is 7860 +/- 120 cal mol-1 and -3.99 +/- 0.42 cal mol-1 K-1, respectively, for the human enzyme. Results for the bovine enzyme were statistically indistinguishable from those of the human enzyme. The entropy of activation of kcat for the human enzyme was further decomposed into partially compensating electrostatic(es) (delta S*es = +15.1 cal mol-1 K-1) and nonelectrostatic(nes) (delta S*nes = -19.1 cal mol-1 K-1) terms. Computer simulations of a formal kinetic mechanism for carbonic anhydrase II-catalyzed CO2 hydration show that 82% of the temperature effect on kcat can be attributed to the temperature effect on the intramolecular proton transfer step. The reported activation parameters are consistent with a substantial enzyme or active site solvent conformational change in the transition state of the intramolecular proton transfer step, and is consistent with the mechanism of proton transfer proposed by Venkatasubban and Silverman (Venkatasubban, K.

        "abstract": "Based on hybrid QM/MM molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations, we investigate the mechanistic and energetic features of the catalytic action of dizinc metallo-beta-lactamase CcrA from Bacteroides fragilis. The 200 ps QM/MM simulation of the CcrA enzyme in complex with nitrocefin shows that the substrate beta-lactam moiety is directed toward the active site dizinc center through the interactions of aminocarbonyl and carboxylate groups with the two active site zinc ions and the two conserved residues, Lys167 and Asn176. From the determination of the potential energy profile of a relevant enzymatic reaction model, it is found that the nucleophilic displacement reaction step proceeds with a low-barrier height, leading to the formation of an energetically favored reaction intermediate. The results also show that the high catalytic activity of the CcrA enzyme stems from a simultaneous operation of three catalytic components: activation of the bridging hydroxide nucleophile by zinc-coordinated Asp86; polarization of the substrate aminocarbonyl group by the first zinc ion; stabilization of the negative charge developed on the departing amide nitrogen by the second zinc ion. Consistent with the previous experimental finding that the proton-transfer reaction step is rate-limiting, the activation energy of the second step is found to be 1.6 kcal/mol higher than that of the first step. Finally, through an examination of the structural and energetic features of binding of a thiazolidinecarboxylic acid inhibitor to the active site dizinc center, a two-step inhibition mechanism involving a protonation-induced ligand exchange reaction is proposed for the inhibitory action of a tight-binding inhibitor possessing a thiol group.",

        "abstract": "ical study of a series of “honeycombed” or ”layered” 3,4-connected nets is presented. The most significant feature of this series of nets is that they have infinite stacks of carbon-carbon double bonds in close contact with each other. Two of these nets have structures that not only contain stacks of 3-connected centers but also have infinite 1-dimensional polymeric units related to cis-polyacetylene. We employ tight-binding band structure calculations on selected examples of these nets to determine their electronic properties. The consequences of a stacked structure are analyzed by calculating the band structure of infinite layers (stacks) of ethylenes. Some of these carbon nets may be metallic. We also show that through-space and through-bond (hyperconjugative) interactions are important in the solid state, but the overall effect of these interactions varies according to the area of k-space that is being sampled. Pursuing our continuing interest in alternative structures of diamond and graphite,’ we decided to study a series of 3,4-connected nets. There are a number of reasons for examining these nets: first, they have an intermediate valency between graphite (3-connected) and diamond (4-connected); second, the density of the nets we will be studying here is intermediate (-3.0 g/cm3) between that of diamond (3.51 g/cm3) and graphite (2.27 g / ~ m ~ ) ; ~ and third, these nets are interesting because they have close intrastack distances (2.3 to 2.8 A) thereby allowing for greater (especially T ) band dispersions (this may make these nets metallic). Before proceeding to a discussion of the electronic properties of these nets we would like to review briefly the current status of the allotropy of carbon. The structurally well-characterized allotropes of carbon are restricted to only two main types: diamond (cubic and hexagonal) and graphite (hexagonal and rh~mbohedra l ) .~ In cubic (1) and hexagonal diamond (2) each carbon atom is tetrahedrally surrounded by four other carbon atoms at a distance of 1.545 A. The structural differences between these two diamond forms can be envisioned in this way: 1 can be imagined to consist of an infinite network of adamantyl moieties, all chair cyclohexane rings, whereas in 2 there are some chair and some boat six-membered T Cornell University. *The Polytechnic. 0002-7863/87/ 1509-6742$01.50/0 rings. Both hexagonal (3) and rhombohedral (4) graphite contain hexagonal carbon layers linked by van der Waals forces. The difference, though, between these two forms lies in the stacking of these sheets. In 3 every third layer repeats (ABAB ...) with the first and second layers displaced away from each other in such a way that one-half of the atoms in each layer are above and below the center of the hexagon in the neighboring layer. 4, on the other hand, has every fourth layer repeating to give an ABCABC ... stacking pattern. There is some evidence for other carbon allotrope^.^ The best studied of these is karbin, sometimes called ~ h a o i t e . ~ . ~ Its structure is thought to contain carbon in alkyne or cumulene needles, 5.

Fourier transforms of coordinate data from MD simulations are used to produce reciprocal space \"fingerprints\" of atomic pair distance correlations that are characteristic of the ensemble and are the direct numerical analogues of experimental solution x-ray diffraction (SXD). SXD experiments and MD simulations were carried out to test the ability of experiment and simulation to resolve sequence-dependent modifications in helix conformation for B-form DNA. SXD experiments demonstrated that solution-state poly(AT) and poly(A)-poly(T) duplex DNA sequences exist in ensembles close to canonical B-form and B'-form structures, respectively. In contrast, MD simulations analyzed in terms of SXD fingerprints are shown to deviate from experiment, most significantly for poly(A)-poly(T) duplex DNA. Compared with experiment, MD simulation shortcomings were found to include both mismatches in simulated conformer structures and number population within the ensembles. This work demonstrates an experimental approach for quantitatively evaluating MD simulations and other coordinate models to simulate biopolymer structure in solution and suggests opportunities to use solution diffraction data as experimental benchmarks for developing supramolecular force fields optimized for a range of in situ applications.",

The interaction energies and structures obtained using this method appear to be insensitive to the use of nonlocal (NL) corrections to the DF method. The is fortuitous because the NL treatment is significantly more computationally expensive than the local treatment.

The magnitude and the effect of the basis set superposition error (BSSE) were carefully investigated. We found that going up to aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets is enough to obtain accurate CBS MP2 energies when BSSE corrected values are used but aug-cc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets are needed when the BSSE uncorrected total energies are used in CBS extrapolations. MP2 interaction energies with smaller basis sets such as 6-31G* are found to have very little dispersion energy and that the true source of dispersion attributed attractive interactions is almost entirely due to BSSE. MP2 and CCSD(T) CBS interaction energies are found to be very close to one another if aromatic systems are not involved.

Classical interpretations, such as osmolyte exclusion from the vicinity of protein, cannot adequately explain the behavior of this osmolyte and were challenged by recent data showing the direct interactions of TMAO with proteins, mainly via hydrophobic binding. Solvent effect theories also fail to propose a straightforward mechanism. To explore the role of water and the hydrophobic association, we disabled osmolyte-protein hydrophobic interactions by replacing water with hexane and using lipase enzyme as an anhydrous-stable protein. Biocatalysis experiments showed that under this non-aqueous condition, TMAO does not act as a stabilizer, but strongly deactivates the enzyme. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that TMAO accumulates near the enzyme and makes many hydrogen bonds with it, like denaturing osmolytes. Some TMAO molecules even reach the active site and interact strongly with the catalystic traid. In aqueous solvent, the enzyme functions well: the extent of TMAO interactions is reduced and can be divided into both polar and non-polar terms. Structural analysis shows that in water, some TMAO molecules bind to the enzyme surface like a surfactant. We show that these interactions limit water-protein hydrogen bonds and unfavorable water-hydrophobic surface contacts. Moreover, a more hydrophobic environment is formed in the solvation layer, which reduces water dynamics and subsequently, rigidifies the backbone in aqueous solution. We show that osmolyte amphiphilicity and protein surface heterogeneity can address the weaknesses of exclusion and solvent effect theories about the TMAO mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Conspectus Quantum mechanics (QM) has revolutionized our understanding of the structure and reactivity of small molecular systems. Given the tremendous impact of QM in this research area, it is attractive to believe that this could also be brought into the biological realm where systems of a few thousand atoms and beyond are routine. Applying QM methods to biological problems brings an improved representation to these systems by the direct inclusion of inherently QM effects such as polarization and charge transfer. Because of the improved representation, novel insights can be gleaned from the application of QM tools to biomacromolecules in aqueous solution. To achieve this goal, the computational bottlenecks of QM methods had to be addressed. In semiempirical theory, matrix diagonalization is rate limiting, while in density functional theory or Hartree-Fock theory electron repulsion integral computation is rate-limiting. In this Account, we primarily focus on semiempirical models where the divide and conquer (D&C) approach linearizes the matrix diagonalization step with respect to the system size. Through the D&C approach, a number of applications to biological problems became tractable. Herein, we provide examples of QM studies on biological systems that focus on protein solvation as viewed by QM, QM enabled structure-based drug design, and NMR and X-ray biological structure refinement using QM derived restraints. Through the examples chosen, we show the power of QM to provide novel insights into biological systems, while also impacting practical applications such as structure refinement. While these methods can be more expensive than classical approaches, they make up for this deficiency by the more realistic modeling of the electronic nature of biological systems and in their ability to be broadly applied. Of the tools and applications discussed in this Account, X-ray structure refinement using QM models is now generally available to the community in the refinement package Phenix. While the power of this approach is manifest, challenges still remain. In particular, QM models are generally applied to static structures, so ways in which to include sampling is an ongoing challenge. Car-Parrinello or Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics approaches address the short time scale sampling issue, but how to effectively use QM to study phenomenon covering longer time scales will be the focus of future research. Finally, how to accurately and efficiently include electron correlation effects to facilitate the modeling of, for example, dispersive interactions, is also a major hurdle that a broad range of groups are addressing The use of QM models in biology is in its infancy, leading to the expectation that the most significant use of these tools to address biological problems will be seen in the coming years. It is hoped that while this Account summarizes where we have been, it will also help set the stage for future research directions at the interface of quantum mechanics and biology.",

        "abstract": "Drug discovery research is increasingly dedicated to biological screening on a massive scale, which seems to imply a basic rejection of many computer-assisted techniques originally designed to add rationality to the early stages of discovery. While ever-faster and more clever 3D methodologies continue to be developed and rejected as alternatives to indiscriminant screening, simpler tools based on 2D structure have carved a stable niche in the high-throughput paradigm of drug discovery. Their staying power is due in no small part to simplicity, ease of use, and demonstrated ability to explain structure-activity data. This observation led us to wonder whether an even simpler view of structure might offer an advantage over existing 2D and 3D methods. Accordingly, we introduce 1D representations of chemical structure, which are generated by collapsing a 3D molecular model or a 2D chemical graph onto a single coordinate of atomic positions. Atoms along this coordinate are differentiated according to elemental type, hybridization, and connectivity. By aligning 1D representations to match up identical atom types, a measure of overall structural similarity is afforded. In extensive structure-activity validation tests, 1D similarities consistently outperform both Daylight 2D fingerprints and Cerius(2) pharmacophore fingerprints, suggesting that this new, simple means of representing and comparing structures may offer a significant advantage over existing tried-and-true methods.",

This result is also supported by results from a continuum solvation model.

The results suggest that ethanolamine dimer formation in aqueous solution is very limited. Simulations were also carried out for CO2 in an aqueous ethanolamine system.

Meanwhile, red PBM has already been studied in clinical trials; however, a comparison of the use of different wavelengths at the same light dose to reduce periocular wrinkles has not yet been performed. Methods: This split-face, randomized clinical trial recruited 137 women (40-65 years old) presenting with skin phototypes II-IV and Glogau photoaging scale types II-IV. The individuals received 10 sessions for 4 weeks of red (660 nm) and amber (590 nm) PBM (3.8 J/cm2), one at each side of the face. The outcomes, measured before and after the treatments, were the periocular wrinkle volume measured by VisioFace® RD equipment; hydration measured by the Corneometer CM 825; skin elasticity measured by the Cutometer Dual MPA 580; and quality of life determined by adapted versions of validated questionnaires [Melasma Quality of Life Scale-Brazilian Portuguese (MelasQoL-BP) and Skindex-29]. Results: There was a significant reduction in wrinkle volume after red (31.6%) and amber (29.9%) PBM. None of the treatments improved skin hydration and viscoelasticity. Both questionnaires showed improvements in participants' quality of life. Conclusions: PBM, both at red and amber wavelengths, is an effective tool for rejuvenation, producing a 30% wrinkle volume reduction. The technique has strong potential in patients with diabetes or those presenting with keloids, conditions for which highly inflammatory rejuvenating procedures are not indicated. Clinical trial registration number: REBEC-6YFCBM.",

Interestingly, we find that polarization and electrostatic interactions are predicted to be less important in protein-water interactions than charge transfer. Charge transfer is most prominent for charged residues, but also occurs between water molecules and the hydrophilic side chains and the carbonyl and amide groups of the main chain. The route of charge transfer is via hydrogen bonds between protein and solvent. These results are consistent with recent NMR and X-ray observations, which show that hydrogen bonding interactions have a significant covalent character as opposed to the traditional purely electrostatic view.",

Elimination is favored for the solution phase reaction, which proceeds by H-bond coordination of a water molecule to the amine nitrogen atoms. The coordination of one water molecule greatly facilitates the reaction by allowing it to proceed through a cyclic six-member transition state. Aspects of the water-urea H-bond interactions have also provided insights into critical aspects of the hydrogen bond pattern in the urease active site.

        "abstract": "An automated fragmentation quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (AF-QM/MM) approach has been developed to routinely calculate ab initio protein NMR chemical shielding constants. The AF-QM/MM method is linear-scaling and trivially parallel. A general fragmentation scheme is employed to generate each residue-centric region which is treated by quantum mechanics, and the environmental electrostatic field is described with molecular mechanics. The AF-QM/MM method shows good agreement with standard self-consistent field (SCF) calculations of the NMR chemical shieldings for the mini-protein Trp cage. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR chemical shieldings are equal to or less than 0.09, 0.32, and 0.78 ppm, respectively, for all Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reported in this work. The environmental electrostatic potential is necessary to accurately reproduce the NMR chemical shieldings using the AF-QM/MM approach. The point-charge models provided by AMBER, AM1/CM2, PM3/CM1, and PM3/CM2 all effectively model the electrostatic field. The latter three point-charge models are generated via semiempirical linear-scaling SCF calculations of the entire protein system. The correlations between experimental 1H NMR chemical shifts and theoretical predictions are >0.95 for AF-QM/MM calculations using B3LYP with the 6-31G**, 6-311G**, and 6-311++G** basis sets.

In particular, we show that it is probable that even highly accurate computed binding free energies have errors that represent a large percentage of the target free energies of binding. This is due to the observation that the error for computed energies quasi-linearly increases with the increasing number of interactions present in a protein-ligand complex. This principle is expected to hold true for any system that involves an ever increasing number of inter or intra-molecular interactions (e.g. ab initio protein folding). We introduce the concept of best-case scenario errors (BCS(errors)) that can be routinely applied to docking and scoring exercises and used to provide errors bars for the computed binding free energies. These BCS(errors) form a basis by which one can evaluate the outcome of a docking and scoring exercise. Moreover, the resultant error analysis enables the formation of an hypothesis that defines the best direction to proceed in order to improve scoring functions used in molecular docking studies.",

The identification of the protonation states of the key aspartates in β-secretase is of great interest both in understanding the reaction mechanism and in guiding the design of drugs against AD. However, the resolutions of currently available crystal structures for BACE are not sufficient to determine the hydrogen atom locations. We have assigned the protonation states of the key aspartates using a novel method, QM/MM X-ray refinement. In our approach, an energy function is introduced to the refinement where the atoms in the active site are modeled by quantum mechanics (QM) and the other atoms are represented by molecular mechanics (MM). The gradients derived from the QM/MM energy function are combined with those from the X-ray target to refine the crystal structure of a complex containing BACE and an inhibitor. A total number of 8 protonation configurations of the aspartyl dyad were considered and QM/MM X-ray refinements were performed for all of them. The relative stability of the refined structures was scored by constructing the thermodynamic cycle using the energetics calculated by fully quantum mechanical self-consistent reaction field (QM/SCRF) calculations. While all 8 refined structures fit the observed electron density about equally well, we find the mono-protonated configurations to be strongly favored energetically, especially the configuration with the inner oxygen of Asp32 protonated and the hydroxyl of the inhibitor pointing towards Asp228. It was also found that these results depend on the constraints imposed by the X-ray data. We suggest that one of the strengths of this approach is that the resulting structures are a consensus of theoretical and experimental data and remark on the significance of our results in structure based drug design and mechanistic studies.",

        "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions are very important in the function of a cell. Computational studies of these interactions have been of interest, but often they have utilized classical modelling techniques. In recent years, quantum mechanical (QM) treatment of entire proteins has emerged as a powerful approach to study biomolecular systems. Herein, we apply a semi-empirical divide and conquer (DC) methodology coupled with a dielectric continuum model for the solvent, to explore the contribution of electrostatics, polarization and charge transfer to the interaction energy between barnase and barstar in their complex form. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was performed to account for the dynamic behavior of the complex. The results show that electrostatics, charge transfer and polarization favor the formation of the complex. Our study shows that electrostatics dominates the interaction between barnase and barstar ( approximately 73%), while charge transfer and polarization are approximately 21% and approximately 6%, respectively. Close inspection of the polarization and charge-transfer effects on the charge distribution of the complex reveals the existence of two, well localized, regions in barstar. The first region includes the residues between P27 and Y47 and the second region is between N65 and D83. Since no such regions could be detected in barnase clearly suggests that barstar is well optimized for efficiently binding barnase. Furthermore, using our interaction energy decomposition scheme, we were able to identify all residues that have been experimentally determined to be important for the complex formation and to suggest other residues never have been investigated. This suggests that our approach will be useful as an aid in further understanding protein-protein contacts for the ultimate goal to produce successful inhibitors for protein complexes.",

One of these approaches is the divide and conquer method and, in this article, we review the implementation of this approach for semiempirical Hamiltonians. This is then followed by brief reviews of three application areas. First, we will discuss the charge distribution of biological molecules in solution as described by quantum mechanics. In particular, the role polarization and charge transfer plays in affecting the charge distribution of proteins will be discussed. Next, we will examine the energetic consequences of charge transfer and polarization on biomolecular solvation. The final section will describe the computation of solvation free energies using a combined divide and conquer/Poisson–Boltzmann approach.

        "abstract": "Divalent metal ions play important roles in biological and materials systems. Molecular dynamics simulation is an efficient tool to investigate these systems at the microscopic level. Recently, four new water models (OPC3, OPC, TIP3P-FB, and TIP4P-FB) have been developed and better represent the physical properties of water than previous models. Metal ion parameters are dependent on the water model employed, making it necessary to develop metal ion parameters for select new water models. In the present work, we performed parameter scanning for the 12-6 Lennard-Jones nonbonded model of divalent metal ions in conjunction with the four new water models as well as four previous water models (TIP3P, SPC/E, TIP4P, and TIP4P-Ew). We found that these new three-point and four-point water models provide comparable or significantly improved performance for the simulation of divalent metal ions when compared to previous water models in the same category. Among all eight water models, the OPC3 water model yields the best performance for the simulation of divalent metal ions in the aqueous phase when using the 12-6 model. On the basis of the scanning results, we independently parametrized the 12-6 model for 24 divalent metal ions with each of the four new water models. As noted previously, the 12-6 model still fails to simultaneously reproduce the experimental hydration free energy (HFE) and ion-oxygen distance (IOD) values even with these new water models. To solve this problem, we parametrized the 12-6-4 model for the 16 divalent metal ions for which we have both experimental HFE and IOD values for each of the four new water models. The final parameters are able to reproduce both the experimental HFE and IOD values accurately. To validate the transferability of our parameters, we carried out benchmark calculations to predict the energies and geometries of ion-water clusters as well as the ion diffusivity coefficient of Mg2+. By comparison to quantum chemical calculations and experimental data, these results show that our parameters are well designed and have excellent transferability. The metal ion parameters for the 12-6 and 12-6-4 models reported herein can be employed in simulations of various biological and materials systems when using the OPC3, OPC, TIP3P-FB, or TIP4P-FB water model.",

This binding ability is particularly important for the distribution, metabolism, and efficacy of drugs. In addition, HSA can also covalently link to different IIA substrates owing to the presence of a highly reactive residue, Lys199, which is strategically located in the IIA site. Herein, we present results of three restrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the IIA binding site on the HSA protein. From these simulations, we have determined the influence that the ionization state of the key residue, Lys199, and the nearby Lys195 has on the structure and dynamics of the IIA binding site. When Lys199 is neutral the computed average distances for the most significant interresidue contacts are in good agreement with those estimated from the X-ray coordinates. The analysis of the solvent structure and dynamics indicates that the basic form of Lys199 is likely connected to the acid form of Lys195 through a network of H-bonding water molecules with a donor --> acceptor character. The presence of these water bridges can be important for stabilizing the configuration of the IIA binding site and/or promoting a potential Lys195 --> Lys199 proton-transfer process. These results suggest that both lysine residues located in the IIA binding site of HSA, Lys195 and Lys199, could play a combined and comparable chemical role.

Because of the expense of the MP2 calculation, we have utilized the fragment molecular orbital method (FMO) in this study. We show that the sum of the Hartree-Fock (HF) energy and force field (LJ6)-derived dispersion energy (HF + LJ6) is well correlated with the energies obtained using second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) theory. In one of the two examples studied, the correlation energy as well as the empirical dispersive energy term was able to discriminate between native and decoy structures. On the other hand, for the second protein we studied, neither the correlation energy nor dispersion energy showed discrimination capabilities; however, the ab initio MP2 energy and the HF+LJ6 both ranked the native structure correctly. Furthermore, when we randomly scrambled the Lennard-Jones parameters, the correlation between the MP2 energy and the sum of the HF energy and dispersive energy (HF+LJ6) significantly drops, which indicates that the choice of Lennard-Jones parameters is important.",

Intramolecular proton transfer between zinc-bound water and H64 is significantly inhibited by the introduction of bulky residues at position 65; kcat for CO2 hydration decreases up to 26-fold, comparable to the observed decrease in intramolecular proton transfer caused by removal of H64 [Tu, C., Silverman, D. N., Forsman, C., Jonsson, B.-H., & Lindskog, S. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 7913-7918]. Intermolecular proton transfer between protonated H64 and external buffer is also inhibited, although to a lesser degree. Furthermore, an alternative proton transfer pathway, consisting of an active site solvent-mediated proton transfer from zinc-water to imidazole buffer, is inhibited in the A65F, A65L, and A65H CAII variants. Therefore, the active solvent bridge between zinc-bound water and H64 is disrupted by substitutions at position 65. The inhibition of proton transfer reactions correlates with the disruption of the crystallographically observed solvent network in the CA active site and rotation of the proton acceptor, H64 [Scolnick, L.

The QM treatment is based on our recently implemented MNDO/NMR method (Wang et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2004, 120, 11392). The effect of the QM/MM partitioning on chemical shifts has been investigated by test calculations on the water dimer and on the protein crambin. It has been shown that the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen bond and nearby groups with significant magnetic susceptibilities is necessary in order to reproduce the full QM results. The method is also applied to a protein-ligand complex FKBP-GPI, and excellent agreement for proton chemical shifts of the ligand is obtained by including the side-chain atoms of the binding site residues into the QM region. The NMR chemical shift calculations using QM/MM-minimized structures still yield satisfactory results. Our results demonstrate that this QM/MM NMR method is able to treat critical regions of very large macromolecules without compromising accuracy if a relatively large QM region is used.",

We studied four different configurations which differ in the protonation state of the Asp103 residue and in the presence or absence of a Zn1-OH-Zn2 bridge. The flexibility of the Zn1-OH-Zn2 bridge was studied by means of quantum mechanical (QM) calculations on cluster models while the relative stabilities of the different configurations were estimated from QM linear scaling calculations on the enzyme. Contacts between important residues (Cys104, Asp69, Lys185, etc.), the solvation of the zinc ions, and the conformation of the active site beta-hairpin loop were characterized by the MD analyses. The influence of the buried sodium ion close to the Zn2 position was investigated by carrying out a secondary simulation where the sodium ion was replaced with an internal water molecule. The comparative structural analyses among the different MD trajectories augmented with energetic calculations have demonstrated that the B. fragilis protein efficiently binds the internal Na(+) ion observed crystallographically. Moreover, we found that when Asp103 is unprotonated, a rigid Zn1-OH-Zn2 bridge results, while for neutral Asp103, a fluctuating Zn1-Zn2 distance was possible via the breaking and formation of the Zn1-OH-Zn2 bridge.

We also show that it is not a necessary requirement that thermophilic enzymes be less flexible than their mesophilic counterparts at low temperatures.

Mixed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods allow electronic effects for a small region of the protein to be calculated, treating the remaining atoms as a fixed charge background for the active site. Such a semi-empirical QM/MM scoring function has been implemented in AMBER using DivCon and tested on a set of 23 metalloprotein-ligand complexes, where QM/MM methods provide a particular advantage in the modeling of the metal ion. The binding affinity of this set of proteins can be calculated with an R(2) of 0.64 and a standard deviation of 1.88 kcal/mol without fitting and 0.71 and a standard deviation of 1.69 kcal/mol with fitted weighting of the individual scoring terms. In this study we explore using various methods to calculate terms in the binding free energy equation, including entropy estimates and minimization standards. From these studies we found that using the rotational bond estimate to ligand entropy results in a reasonable R(2) of 0.63 without fitting. We also found that using the ESCF energy of the proteins without minimization resulted in an R(2) of 0.57, when using the rotatable bond entropy estimate.",

In particular, in the data mining arena we discuss rapid docking tools and how we employ them, and we describe a novel data mining tool based on a ID representation of a molecule followed by a molecular sequence alignment step. For the ADME area we discuss the development and application of absorption, blood-brain barrier (BBB) and solubility models.

Most interestingly, the water molecule connecting Glu166 and Ser70 does not exchange with bulk solvent, emphasizing its structural and catalytic relevance. In the presence of the substrate, Ser130, Ser235, and Arg244 directly interact with the beta-lactam carboxylate via H-bonds, whereas the Lys234 ammonium group has only an electrostatic influence. These interactions together with other specific contacts result in a very short distance ( approximately 3 A) between the attacking hydroxyl group of Ser70 and the beta-lactam ring carbonyl group, which is a favorable orientation for nucleophilic attack. Our simulations also gave insight into the possible pathways for proton abstraction from the Ser70 hydroxyl group.

Ionization of the protein groups is treated assuming \"pH memory,\" i.e., using the ionization states characteristic of aqueous solution. Neutralization of charged groups by counterions is done by considering a counterion for each charged group that cannot be made neutral by establishing a salt bridge with another charged group; this treatment is more physically reasonable for the nonaqueous situation, contrasting with the usual procedures. Our studies show that hydration has a profound effect on protein stability and flexibility in nonaqueous solvents. The structure becomes more nativelike with increasing values of hydration, up to a certain point, when further increases render it unstable and unfolding starts to occur. There is an optimal amount of water, approximately 10% (w/w), where the protein structure and flexibility are closer to the ones found in aqueous solution. This behavior can explain the experimentally known bell-shaped dependence of enzyme catalysis on hydration, and the molecular reasons for it are examined here. Water and counterions play a fundamental and dynamic role on protein stabilization, but they also seem to be important for protein unfolding at high percentages of bound water.",

This work considers a new direction-the connection to configurational entropy-and how it might change the nature of our understanding of protein force field development to equally well encompass globular proteins, IDRs/IDPs, and disorder-to-order transitions. We have evaluated representative pairwise and many-body protein and water force fields against experimental data on representative IDPs and IDRs, a peptide that undergoes a disorder-to-order transition, for seven globular proteins ranging in size from 130 to 266 amino acids. We find that force fields with the largest statistical fluctuations consistent with the radius of gyration and universal Lindemann values for folded states simultaneously better describe IDPs and IDRs and disorder-to-order transitions. Hence, the crux of what a force field should exhibit to well describe IDRs/IDPs is not just the balance between protein and water energetics but the balance between energetic effects and configurational entropy of folded states of globular proteins.",

On the basis of these comparative studies, we propose a monodentate coordination of urea in the active site from which both the elimination and hydrolytic pathways can decompose urea into CO2 and NH3. This observation is counter to what has been experimentally suggested based on the exogenous observation of carbamic acid (the reaction product from the hydrolysis pathway). However, this does not address what has occurred at the active site of urease prior to product release. On the basis of our computed results, the observation that urea prefers the elimination channel in aqueous solution and on the observation of Lippard and co-workers of an elimination reaction channel in a urease biomimetic model, we propose that the elimination channel needs to be re-examined as a viable reaction channel in urease.",

We perform molecular dynamics simulations for a system consisting of 64 or 216 water molecules in a periodic cubic box. The whole system is described quantum mechanically. Calculations with 64 molecules have been carried out using standard SCF techniques whereas calculations with 216 molecules have been done using the divide and conquer approach. This method has also been used in one simulation case with 64 molecules for test purposes. Within this scope, the molecular dynamics program ROAR have been coupled with a linear scaling semiempirical code (DivCon) implemented in a parallel MPI version. The predicted liquid water structure using either AM1 or PM3 is shown to be very poor due to well-known limitations of these methods describing hydrogen bonds. In contrast, PM3-PIF and PM3-MAIS calculations lead to results in reasonably good agreement with experimental data. The best results for the heat of vaporization are obtained with the PM3-PIF method. The average induced dipole moment of the water molecule in the liquid is underestimated by all semiempirical techniques, which seems to be related to the NDDO approximation and to the use of minimal basis sets.

Given that heavy-atom tunneling plays a role in planar bond shifting of cyclobutadiene, we computationally explored the contribution of heavy-atom tunneling to planar π-bond shifting in the major (CTCTCTCT, 5a) and minor (CTCTTCTT, 6a) known isomers of [16]annulene. UM06-2X/cc-pVDZ calculations yield bond-shifting barriers of ca. 10 kcal/mol. The results also reveal extremely narrow barrier widths, suggesting a high probability of tunneling for these bond-shifting reactions. Rate constants were calculated using canonical variational transition state theory (CVT) as well as with small curvature tunneling (SCT) contributions, via direct dynamics. For the major isomer 5a, the computed SCT rate constant for bond shifting at 80 K is 0.16 s-1, corresponding to a half-life of 4.3 s, and indicating that bond shifting is rapid at cryogenic temperatures despite a 10 kcal/mol barrier. This contrasts with the CVT rate constant of 8.0 × 10-15 s-1 at 80 K. The minor isomer 6a is predicted to undergo rapid bond shifting via tunneling even at 10 K. For both isomers, bond shifting is predicted to be much faster than competing conformation change despite lower barriers for the latter process. The preference for bond shifting represents cases of tunneling control in which the preferred reaction is dominated by heavy-atom motions. At all temperatures below -50 °C, tunneling is predicted to dominate the bond shifting process for both 5a and 6a. Thus, [16]annulene is predicted to be an example of tunneling by 16 carbons. Bond shifting in both isomers is predicted to be rapid at temperatures accessible by solution-phase NMR spectroscopy, and an experiment is proposed to verify these predictions.",

One of the major therapeutic options for its management is based on the inhibition of the metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1). CA inhibitors (CAIs) diminish ocular hypertension in glaucomatous patients by reducing the rate of bicarbonate formation and thus, the secretion of the aqueous humor. Areas covered: This review is intended to cover the major contributions in terms of patent literature reports for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases by means of CAIs in a time frame spanning from 2013 to date. Expert opinion: The patent literature is dominated by innovative pharmaceutical formulations including a CAI alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents. Very few novelties within drug discovery are currently present and they mainly account for new CAI moieties and classical CAIs merged into scaffolds bearing additional chemical functionalities beneficial for the pharmacological treatment of the disease. It is reasonable to expect that in the near future the so-called 'old drugs' will achieve pharmacological performances in the management of ocular hypertension beyond any expectations and thus open a new era of drug repurposing merely based on material science advancements.",

        "abstract": "A novel method is proposed in which combined restraints derived from linear-scaling semiempirical quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations and X-ray diffraction data are combined to refine crystal structures of proteins. Its performance has been tested on a small protein molecule, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). The refinement involves minimization of the sum of a geometric energy function and an X-ray target function based on either the least-squares residual or the maximum-likelihood formalism. For comparison, similar refinement runs have also been performed using energy restraints derived from the force field available in the Crystallography & NMR System (CNS) program. The QM refinements were carried out with weights that were varied by several orders of magnitude and the optimal weights were identified by observing the trend in the final free R values, QM heats of formation and coordinate root-mean-square deviations (r.m.s.d.s) from the crystal structure. It is found that the QM weights are typically smaller but generally on the same scale as the molecular-mechanics (MM) weights for the respective X-ray target functions. The crystallographic R, free R, real-space R values and correlation coefficients based on the structures refined with the energy restraints derived from our QM calculations and Engh and Huber parameters are comparable, suggesting that the QM restraints are capable of maintaining reasonable stereochemistry to a similar degree as the force-field parameters. A detailed inspection of the structures refined with the QM and MM energy restraints reveals that one of the common differences between them and the crystal structure is that the strained bond angles in the crystal structure are corrected after energetically restrained refinements. Systematic differences in certain bond lengths between the QM-refined structures and the statistical averages of experimental structures have also been observed and discussed.",

One of the most recent and striking examples of such a phenomenon within Europe is demonstrated by the Polissia region in Northern Ukraine, famous for its amber deposits. Amid severe political disturbances and subsequent economic recession in Ukraine in 2014 and 2015, amber mining flourished in the region. However, the extent and spatial pattern of degraded land caused by amber mining over the entire region has remained unknown. To fill this gap and track land surface changes, we used multi-source satellite imagery. We found a gradual decrease of the area without vegetation cover, as a proxy for degraded land, from the late Soviet period until 2014 in most of the analysed administrative districts of Polissia. In contrast to this, we identified substantial conversion of forest and agricultural land to bare soil that occurred between 2014 and 2016, which can be attributed to the rush of illegal amber mining in the region. The estimated total area of affected land on the produced Landsat-based map for 2016 was 1066 ha, 60% of which occurred in 2014-2016. Land cover classification within a key study area suggests that utilization of very high-resolution images from the WorldView-2 satellite enables more accurate mapping of land degradation and identification of small mining sites. Further monitoring of land-use change caused by amber mining is essential to improving understanding of long-lasting environmental impacts on regional ecosystems and biodiversity.",

All calculations were carried out at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory using the counterpoise method of Boys and Bernardi (Boys, S. F.; Bernardi, F. Mol. Phys. 1970, 19, 553) to account for the basis set superposition error. Fluorine substitutions are made onto the face molecule of the edge-to-face benzene dimer. As one might expect, the substitution of additional fluorines into this system generally resulted in a decrease of the binding energy. It was also found that the positioning of the fluorine substituents on isosubstituted compounds has a large effect on the total binding energy of these types of systems. More specifically, complexes with fluorines that are substituted closer to the hydrogen atoms of the edge benzene will tend to be stabilized by an electrostatic interaction between the partially negative fluorine atoms and the partially positive hydrogen atoms. However, our findings do not explain the recent crystallographic findings for the SBB-HCAII protein-ligand complex, where increased fluorination resulted in closer edge-to-face contacts, which suggests that there are factors, other than edge-to-face aromatic interactions, influencing this system's behavior.",

It has been intuited that calculated energies from physics-based scoring functions are able to distinguish native from nonnative folds based on previous performance with small proteins and that conformational sampling is the fundamental bottleneck to successful folding. We demonstrate that as protein size increases, errors in the computed energies become a significant problem. We show, by using error probability density functions, that physics-based scores contain significant systematic and random errors relative to accurate reference energies. These errors propagate throughout an entire protein and distort its energy landscape to such an extent that modern scoring functions should have little chance of success in finding the free energy minima of large proteins. Nonetheless, by understanding errors in physics-based score functions, they can be reduced in a post-hoc manner, improving accuracy in energy computation and fold discrimination.",

Stereochemical restraints have been replaced with more robust functionals through the integration of the linear-scaling, semiempirical quantum-mechanics (SE-QM) program DivCon with the PHENIX X-ray refinement engine. The PHENIX/DivCon package has been thoroughly validated on a population of 50 protein-ligand Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures with a range of resolutions and chemistry. The PDB structures used for the validation were originally refined utilizing various refinement packages and were published within the past five years. PHENIX/DivCon does not utilize CIF(s), link restraints and other parameters for refinement and hence it does not make as many a priori assumptions about the model. Across the entire population, the method results in reasonable ligand geometries and low ligand strains, even when the original refinement exhibited difficulties, indicating that PHENIX/DivCon is applicable to both single-structure and high-throughput crystallography.",

The measured differences between the relative experimental free energies of solvation of benzene, anisole, DMB, and TMB support the concept of near additivity of aromatic methoxy group contributions to such gas phase to water transfer free energies. Calculated differences in solvation free energies were shown to be sensitive to the choice of electrostatic charge distribution model.

This state is easily reached from the open state via low free energy barriers. Additionally, we have found that even when the flap is closed, a region of the binding pocket is solvent-exposed, leading to the hypothesis that it may act as a substrate/product reservoir.

Quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations showed that the Cu(+) and Ag(+) interactions with Trp44 are of similar strength (~14 kcal/mol) and bond order. Quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) calculations showed that Cu(+) binds in a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment in the Trp44Met mutant, which lacks the cation-π interaction. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of CusF in the apo and Cu(+)-bound states emphasized the importance of the Cu(+)-Trp44 interaction in protecting Cu(+) from water oxidation. The protein structure does not change over the time scale of hundreds of nanoseconds in the metal-bound state. The metal recognition site exhibits small motions in the apo state but remains largely preorganized toward metal binding. Trp44 remains oriented to form the cation-π interaction in the apo state and faces an energetic penalty to move away from the metal ion.

        "abstract": "g question regarding the energetics of protein‐ligand binding has been; what is the strain energy that a ligand pays (if any) when binding to its protein target? The traditional method to estimate strain energy uses force fields to calculate the energy difference between the ligand bound conformation and its nearest local minimum/global minimum on the gas‐phase or aqueous phase potential energy surface. This makes the implicit assumption that the underlying force field as well as the reference crystal structure is accurate. Herein, we use ibuprofen as a test case and compare MMFF and ab initio QM methods to identify the local and global minimum conformations. Nine low energy conformations were identified with HF/6‐31G* geometry optimization in vacuo. We also obtained highly accurate relative energies for ibuprofen's conformational energy surface based on M06/aug‐cc‐pVXZ (X = D and T), MP2/aug‐cc‐pVXZ (X = D and T) and the MP2/CBS method (with and without solvent corrections). Moreover, we curate and re‐refine the ibuprofen‐protein complex (PDB 2BXG) using QM/MM X‐ray refinement approaches (HF/6‐31G* was the QM method and the MM model was the AMBER force field ff99sb), which were compared with the low energy conformers to calculate the strain energy. The result indicates that there was an 88% reduction in ibuprofen conformation strain using the QM/MM refined structure versus the original PDB ibuprofen conformations. Furthermore, our results indicate that, due to its inherent limitations in estimating electrostatic interactions, force fields are not suitable to gauge strain energy for charged drug molecules like ibuprofen.

We considered two catalytically important configurations, which differ in the presence or absence of a hydroxide bridge connecting the two zinc ions in the active site. The structural and dynamical effects induced by substrate binding, the specific roles of the conserved residues and the zinc-bound water molecules, the near attack conformers of the Michaelis complex, and so forth, are discussed in detail. The relative stability of the two configurations was estimated from QM linear scaling calculations on the enzyme-substrate complex combined with Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatic calculations and normal mode calculations. Importantly, we find that the two configurations have similar energies, indicating that these two structures could readily be interchanged, thereby facilitating catalysis. The configuration with the hydroxide bound to the two zinc ions is predicted to be the resting form of the enzyme, while the configuration without the bridge is the reactive form that was found to place the hydroxide in position to attack the carbonyl of the beta-lactam ring. Thus, we propose that the enzyme initiates catalysis by converting from the hydroxide bridge form into the configuration that lacks the hydroxide bridge. This interconversion increases the nucleophilicity of the hydroxide ion and exposes it to the beta-lactam carbonyl, which ultimately facilitates nucleophilic attack. The implications of the observed modes of binding, the possible influence of mutating the Lys184 and Asn193 residues on substrate binding, and the reaction mechanism are also discussed in detail.",

Zn(II) binding induces a quaternary structural switch from a \"closed\" conformation to a more \"open\" conformation, reducing the DNA binding affinity by 4 orders of magnitude. In this study, we use classical molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the molecular basis for the large conformational motions and allosteric coupling free energy (~6 kcal/mol) associated with Zn(II) binding. Our simulations successfully capture the closed to open allosteric switching in DNA bound CzrA on Zn(II) binding. They reveal that zinc binding quenches global conformational sampling by CzrA, whereas DNA binding enhances the mobility of residues in the allosteric metal binding sites. These findings are in close agreement with experiments. We also identify networks of residues involved in correlated and anticorrelated motions that connect the metal binding and DNA binding sites. Our analysis of the essential dynamics shows metal ion binding to be the primary driving force for the quaternary structural change in CzrA. We also show that Zn(II) binding limits the conformational space sampled by CzrA and causes the electrostatic surface potential at the DNA binding interface to become less favorable toward DNA binding. Finally, our simulations provide strong support for a proposed hydrogen-bonding pathway that physically connects the metal binding residue, His97, to the DNA binding interface through the αR helix that is present only in the Zn(II)-bound state.

The concept of solvent compatibility embodies the ideas that in order for a protein to be active in organic solvents it must be able to retain its overall shape and that it must not become too rigid such that catalytic activity is compromised. Moreover, neither should the active site region be obstructed by conformational changes that block or structurally alter the active site nor should the active site binding pocket be blocked by solvent ...",

We have developed a bonded model for the catalytic and structural zinc centers (Hoops, S. C.; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 8262-8270) where the electrostatic representation for this model was derived using a novel quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) minimization procedure followed by electrostatic potential fitting. The resulting bonded model for the zinc ions was then used to generate MD trajectories for structural analysis and FEP studies. This model has satisfactorily reproduced the structural features of the active site, and furthermore, the FEP simulations gave relative free energies of binding in good agreement with experimental results. MD simulations in conjunction with the FEP are able to provide a structural explanation regarding why one hydroxamate inhibitor is favored over the other, and we are also able to make predictions about changes in the inhibitor that would enhance protein-inhibitor interactions.",

We call it the extended ZAFF (EZAFF) model because the original ZAFF model was only formulated for four-coordinated systems, while EZAFF additionally can tackle five- and six-coordinated systems. Tests were carried out for six metalloproteins and six organometallic compounds with different coordination spheres. Results validated the reliability of the current model to handle a variety of zinc containing complexes. Meanwhile, benchmark calculations were performed to assess the performance of three bonded molecular mechanics models (EZAFF, Seminario, and Z-matrix models), four nonbonded parameter sets (the HFE, IOD, CM, and 12-6-4 models), and four semiempirical quantum mechanical methods (AM1, PM3, PM6, and SCC-DFTB methods) for simulating zinc containing systems. The obtained results indicate that, even with their increased computational cost, the semiempirical quantum methods only offered slightly better accuracy for the computation of relative energies and only afforded similar molecular geometries, when compared to the investigated molecular mechanics models.",

In addition to the ability of staphylococci to withstand treatment, surgical intervention in an effort to remove necrotic and infected bone further exacerbates patient impairment. Despite the advances in current health care, osteomyelitis is now a major clinical challenge, with recurrent and persistent infections occurring in approximately 40% of patients.

Herein we calculate the pairwise decomposition of the interaction energy between the protein human carbonic anhydrase II (HCAII) and the fluorine-substituted ligand N-(4-sulfamylbenzoyl)benzylamine (SBB) using semiempirical quantum mechanics based methods. We dissect the interaction between the ligand and the protein by dividing the ligand and the protein into subsystems to understand the structure-activity relationships as a result of fluorine substitution. In particular, the off-diagonal elements of the Fock matrix that is composed of the interaction between the ionic core and the valence electrons and the exchange energy between the subsystems or atoms of interest is examined in detail. Our analysis reveals that the fluorine-substituted benzylamine group of SBB does not directly affect the binding energy. Rather, we find that the strength of the interaction between Thr199 of HCAII and the sulfamylbenzoyl group of SBB affects the binding affinity between the protein and the ligand. These observations underline the importance of the sulfonamide group in binding affinity as shown by previous experiments (Maren, T. H.; Wiley: C. E. J. Med. Chem. 1968, 11, 228-232).

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and lipopeptides (LPs) represent very promising molecules to fight resistant bacterial infections due to their broad-spectrum of activity, their first target, i.e. the bacterial membrane, and the rapid bactericidal action. For both types of molecules, the action mechanism starts from the membrane of the pathogen agents, producing a disorganization of their phase structure or the formation of pores of different size altering their permeability. This mechanism of action is based on physical interactions more than on a lock-and-key recognition event and it is difficult for the pathogens to rapidly develop an effective resistance. Very small differences in the sequence of both AMPs and LPs might lead to very different effects on the target membrane. Therefore, a correct understanding of their mechanism of action is required with the aim of developing new synthetic peptides, analogues of the natural ones, with specific and more powerful bactericidal activity. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), with its high resolution and the associated force spectroscopy resource, provides a valuable technique to investigate the reorganization of lipid bilayers exposed to antimicrobial or lipopeptides. Here, we present AFM results obtained by ours and other groups on the action of AMPs and LPs on supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) of different composition. We also consider data obtained by fluorescence microscopy to compare the AFM data with another technique which can be used on different lipid bilayer model systems such as SLBs and giant unilamellar vesicles. The outcomes here presented highlight the powerful of AFM-based techniques in detecting nanoscale peptide-membrane interactions and strengthen their use as an exceptional complementary tool toin vivoinvestigations. Indeed, the combination of these approaches can help decipher the mechanisms of action of different antimicrobials and lipopeptides at both the micro and nanoscale levels, and to design new and more efficient antimicrobial compounds.",

        "abstract": "Molecular recognition and ligand binding involving proteins underlie the most important life processes within the cell, such as substrate transport, catalysis, signal transmission, receptor trafficking, gene regulation, switching on and off of biochemical pathways. Despite recent successes in predicting the structures of many protein-substrate complexes, the dynamic aspects of binding have been largely neglected by computational/theoretical investigations. Recently, several groups have started tackling these problems with the use of experimental and simulation methods and developed models describing the variation of protein dynamics upon complex formation, shedding light on how substrate or inhibitor binding can alter protein flexibility and function. The study of ligand-induced dynamic variations has also been exploited to review the concept of allosteric changes, in the absence of major conformational changes. In this context, the study of the influence of protein motions on signal transduction and on catalytic activities has been used to develop pharmacophore models based on ensembles of protein conformations. These models, taking flexibility explicitly into account, are able to distinguish active inhibitors versus nonactive drug-like compounds, to define new molecular motifs and to preferentially identify specific ligands for a certain protein target. The application of these methods holds great promise in advancing structure-based drug discovery and medicinal chemistry in general, opening up the possibility to explore broader chemical spaces than is normally done in an efficient way. In this review, examples illustrating the extent to which simulations can be used to understand these phenomena will be presented along with examples of methodological developments to increase physical understanding of the processes and improve the possibility to rationally design new molecules.",

        "abstract": "Because dysregulation and mutations of protein kinases play causal roles in human disease, this family of enzymes has become one of the most important drug targets over the past two decades. The X-ray crystal structures of 21 of the 27 FDA-approved small molecule inhibitors bound to their target protein kinases are depicted in this paper. The structure of the enzyme-bound antagonist complex is used in the classification of these inhibitors. Type I inhibitors bind to the active protein kinase conformation (DFG-Asp in, αC-helix in). Type I½ inhibitors bind to a DFG-Asp in inactive conformation while Type II inhibitors bind to a DFG-Asp out inactive conformation. Type I, I½, and type II inhibitors occupy part of the adenine binding pocket and form hydrogen bonds with the hinge region connecting the small and large lobes of the enzyme. Type III inhibitors bind next to the ATP-binding pocket and type IV inhibitors do not bind to the ATP or peptide substrate binding sites. Type III and IV inhibitors are allosteric in nature. Type V inhibitors bind to two different regions of the protein kinase domain and are therefore bivalent inhibitors. The type I-V inhibitors are reversible. In contrast, type VI inhibitors bind covalently to their target enzyme. Type I, I½, and II inhibitors are divided into A and B subtypes. The type A inhibitors bind in the front cleft, the back cleft, and near the gatekeeper residue, all of which occur within the region separating the small and large lobes of the protein kinase. The type B inhibitors bind in the front cleft and gate area but do not extend into the back cleft. An analysis of the limited available data indicates that type A inhibitors have a long residence time (minutes to hours) while the type B inhibitors have a short residence time (seconds to minutes). The catalytic spine includes residues from the small and large lobes and interacts with the adenine ring of ATP. Nearly all of the approved protein kinase inhibitors occupy the adenine-binding pocket; thus it is not surprising that these inhibitors interact with nearby catalytic spine (CS) residues. Moreover, a significant number of approved drugs also interact with regulatory spine (RS) residues.",

How individual ArsR repressors have evolved to respond to selective stimuli is of intrinsic interest. The Ni(II)/Co(II)-specific repressor NmtR and related actinomycete nickel sensors harbor a conserved N-terminal α-NH(2)-Gly2-His3-Gly4 sequence. Here, we present the solution structure of homodimeric apo-NmtR and show that the core of the molecule adopts a typical winged-helix ArsR repressor (α1-α2-α3-αR-β1-β2-α5) \"open conformation\" that is similar to that of the related zinc sensor Staphylococcus aureus CzrA, but harboring long, flexible N-terminal (residues 2-16) and C-terminal (residues 109-120) extensions. Binding of Ni(II) to the regulatory sites induces strong paramagnetic broadening of the α5 helical region and the extreme N-terminal tail to residue 10. Ratiometric pulse chase amidination mass spectrometry reveals that the rate of amidination of the α-amino group of Gly2 is strongly attenuated in the Ni(II) complex relative to the apo state and noncognate Zn(II) complex. Ni(II) binding also induces dynamic disorder on the microsecond to millisecond time scale of key DNA interacting regions that likely contributes to the negative regulation of DNA binding by Ni(II). Molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations reveal that NmtR readily accommodates a distal Ni(II) hexacoordination model involving the α-amine and His3 of the N-terminal region and α5 residues Asp91', His93', His104, and His107, which collectively define a new metal sensing site configuration in ArsR family regulators.",

A test refinement was also performed with the reflections truncated at a high-resolution cutoff of 2.5 Angstrom and with random perturbations introduced into the initial coordinates, which showed that low-resolution refinements with physically based energy functions held the structure closer to the experimental structure solved at 1 Angstrom resolution than the EH-based refinements.",

        "abstract": "A central problem in de novo drug design is determining the binding affinity of a ligand with a receptor. A new scoring algorithm is presented that estimates the binding affinity of a protein-ligand complex given a three-dimensional structure. The method, LISA (Ligand Identification Scoring Algorithm), uses an empirical scoring function to describe the binding free energy. Interaction terms have been designed to account for van der Waals (VDW) contacts, hydrogen bonding, desolvation effects, and metal chelation to model the dissociation equilibrium constants using a linear model. Atom types have been introduced to differentiate the parameters for VDW, H-bonding interactions, and metal chelation between different atom pairs. A training set of 492 protein-ligand complexes was selected for the fitting process. Different test sets have been examined to evaluate its ability to predict experimentally measured binding affinities. By comparing with other well-known scoring functions, the results show that LISA has advantages over many existing scoring functions in simulating protein-ligand binding affinity, especially metalloprotein-ligand binding affinity. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was also used in order to demonstrate that the energy terms in LISA are well designed and do not require extra cross terms.",

While the counterpoise method has become a standard procedure for correcting intermolecular BSSE, most current approaches to correcting intramolecular BSSE are simply fragment-based analogues of the counterpoise method which require many (two times the number of fragments) additional quantum calculations in their application. We propose that magnitudes of both forms of BSSE can be quickly estimated by dividing a system into interacting fragments, estimating each fragment's contribution to the overall BSSE with a simple statistical model, and then propagating these errors throughout the entire system. Such a method requires no additional quantum calculations, but rather only an analysis of the system's interacting fragments. The method is described herein and is applied to a protein-ligand system, a small helical protein, and a set of native and decoy protein folds.",

Because the chemical shift perturbation (CSP) is exquisitely sensitive on the orientation of the ligand inside the binding pocket, NMRScore offers an accurate and straightforward approach to score different poses. All scoring functions were inspected by their abilities to highly rank the native-like structures and separate them from decoy poses generated for a protein-ligand complex. The overall performance of NMRScore is much better than that of energy-based scoring functions associated with docking programs in both aspects. In summary, we find that the combination of docking programs with NMRScore results in an approach that can robustly determine the binding site structure for a protein-ligand complex, thereby providing a new tool facilitating the structure-based drug discovery process.",

We show that the calculated NMR chemical shift at the alcohol proton converges to the experimental result provided that a sufficient number of solvent molecules are included in the GIAO calculation.

Our computational results show that, except for gamma-tubulin, all members of the C. elegans tubulin family have similar secondary and 3D structures and that the change in the pattern of hydrogen bonds in the GTP-binding site may be used to assess the relative stability of different alpha/beta-tubulin dimers formed by monomers of the tubulin family.",

However, when the point charges are derived using the 6‐31G* basis set we find that scaling the intramolecular electrostatic nonbond interactions is necessary. AM1 does not work very well for these compounds when compared to the ab initio methods and, therefore, should only be used in cases when ab initio calculations would be prohibitive.

To that end, a novel computational approach was devised to identify compounds that reduce the activity of urease, a medically important enzyme of Helicobacter pylori, Proteus mirabilis, and many other microorganisms. Urease contains a flexible loop that covers its active site; Glide was used to identify small molecules predicted to lock this loop in an open conformation. These compounds were screened against the model urease from Klebsiella aerogenes, and the natural products epigallocatechin and quercetin were shown to inhibit at low and high micromolar concentrations, respectively. These molecules exhibit a strong time-dependent inactivation of urease that was not due to their oxygen sensitivity. Rather, these compounds appear to inactivate urease by reacting with a specific Cys residue located on the flexible loop. Substitution of this cysteine by alanine in the C319A variant increased the urease resistance to both epigallocatechin and quercetin, as predicted by the computational studies. Protein dynamics are integral to the function of many enzymes; thus, identification of compounds that lock an enzyme into a single conformation presents a useful approach to define potential inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "NphB is an aromatic prenyltransferase that catalyzes the attachment of a 10-carbon geranyl group to aromatic substrates. Importantly, NphB exhibits a rich substrate selectivity and product regioselectivity. A systematic computational study has been conducted in order to address several question associated with NphB-catalyzed geranylation. The reaction mechanism of the prenylation step has been characterized as a S(N)1 type dissociative mechanism with a weakly stable carbocation intermediate. A novel π-chamber composed of Tyr121, Tyr216, and 1,6-DHN is found to be important in stabilizing the carbocation. The observed difference in the rates of product formation from 5- and 2-prenylation arises from the differing orientations of the aromatic substrate in the resting state. 4-Prenylation shares the same resting state with 5-prenylation, but the lower free energy barrier for carbocation formation makes the latter reaction more facile. The high free energy barrier associated with 7-prenylation is caused by the unfavorable orientation of 1,6-DHN in active site pocket, along with the difficulty of proton elimination after the prenylation step. A water-mediated proton transfer facilitates the loss of hydrogen at the prenylation site to form the final prenylated product. Interestingly, the same crystallographically observed water molecule has been found to be responsible for proton loss in all three experimentally identified products. After proton transfer, the relaxation of the final product from a sp(3) carbon center to a sp(2) center triggers a \"spring-loaded\" product release mechanism which pushes the final product out of the binding pocket toward the edge of the active site. The hydrogen bond interactions between the two hydroxyl groups of the aromatic product and the side chains of Ser214 and Tyr288 help to \"steer\" the movement of the product. In addition, mutagenesis studies identify these same two side chains as being responsible for the observed regioselectivity, particularly 2-prenylation. These observations provide valuable insights into NphB chemistry, offering an opportunity to better engineer the active site and to control the reactivity in order to obtain high yields of the desired product(s). Furthermore, the S(N)1 reaction mechanism observed for NphB differs from the prenylation reaction found in, for example, the farnesyltransferase, which proceeds via an S(N)2-like reaction pathway. The spring-loaded release mechanism highlighted herein also offers novel insights into how enzymes facilitate product release.",

Compared with the extensively used point-charge additive force fields that apply fixed atom-centered point partial charges to model electrostatic interactions, polarizable force fields are thought to have the advantage of modeling the atomic polarization effects. Previous works have demonstrated the accuracy of the recently developed polarizable Gaussian multipole (pGM) models. In this work, we assessed the transferability of the electrostatic parameters of the pGM models with (pGM-perm) and without (pGM-ind) atomic permanent dipoles in terms of reproducing the electrostatic potentials surrounding molecules/oligomers absent from electrostatic parameterizations. Encouragingly, both the pGM-perm and pGM-ind models show significantly improved transferability than the additive model in the tests (1) from water monomer to water oligomer clusters; (2) across different conformations of amino acid dipeptides and tetrapeptides; (3) from amino acid tetrapeptides to longer polypeptides; and (4) from nucleobase monomers to Watson-Crick base pair dimers and tetramers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the double-conformation fittings using amino acid tetrapeptides in the αR and β conformations can result in good transferability not only across different tetrapeptide conformations but also from tetrapeptides to polypeptides with lengths ranging from 1 to 20 repetitive residues for both the pGM-ind and pGM-perm models. In addition, the observation that the pGM-ind model has significantly better accuracy and transferability than the point-charge additive model, even though they have an identical number of parameters, strongly suggest the importance of intramolecular polarization effects. In summary, this and previous works together show that the pGM models possess both accuracy and transferability, which are expected to serve as foundations for the development of next-generation polarizable force fields for modeling various polarization-sensitive biological systems and processes.",

        "abstract": "A scheme to decompose the intermolecular interaction energy of a series of complexes at the semiempirical (SE) level has been developed and validated. The comparative binding energy analysis (COMBINE) (Ortiz, A. R.; Pisabarro, M. T.; Gago, F.; Wade, R. C. J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 2681-2691) and the semiempirical quantum mechanical method pairwise energy decomposition (PWD) (Raha, K.; van der Vaart, A. J.; Riley, K. E.; Peters, M. B.; Westerhoff, L. M. Kim, H.; Merz, K. M., Jr. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 6583-6594) were coupled together to form SE-COMBINE. This approach calculates the residue pairwise electrostatic interaction energies, and QSAR models were built with the energies as descriptors using partial least squares (PLS). The application of SE-COMBINE was used as an investigation of the intermolecular interactions between 88 benzamidine inhibitors and trypsin and to test the ability of this new method to predict binding free energies. The predictive capability of SE-COMBINE is shown to be comparable to those of other QSAR methods, and using graphical intermolecular interaction maps (IMMs) enhances the interpretability of receptor-based QSARs.",

        "abstract": "A new approach to calculate nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts has been implemented at the semiempirical modified neglect of diatomic overlap level using gauge-including atomic orbitals. The perturbed density matrix with respect to the magnetic field is obtained by the diagonalization of the complex Fock matrix using the divide and conquer (DC) method, instead of by solving the computationally expensive coupled perturbed Hartree-Fock equations. Adopting the Patchkovskii and Thiel parameters [S. Patchkovskii and W. Thiel J. Comput. Chem. 20, 1220 (1999)], we were able to reproduce their results for small organic molecules. The errors introduced by DC method are negligible, as shown by the calculations on a series of polyalaine structures. Test calculations on proteins have demonstrated that our approach makes it possible to calculate chemical shifts routinely on systems with hundreds of atoms with good accuracy.",

        "abstract": "The symmetrical structures 2,5-bis(benzoxazol-2-yl)thiophene-3,4-diol (BBTD) can take shape two intramolecular hydrogen bonds in chloroform. In order to research the molecular dynamic behavior of BBTD upon photo-induced process, we utilize density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to complete theoretical calculation. Through the comparison of bond length, bond angle, IR spectra, and frontier molecular orbitals between ground state (S0) and first excited state (S1), it clearly indicates that photoexcitation have slightly influence for intensity of hydrogen bond. For the sake of understanding the mechanism of excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) of BBTD in chloroform, potential energy surfaces have been scanned along with the orientation of O1-H2 and O4-H5 in S0 and S1 state, respectively. A intrigued hydrogen bond dynamic phenomenon has been found that ESIPT of BBTD is not a synergetic double proton transfer process, but a stepwise single proton transfer process BBTD→BBTD-S→BBTD-D. Moreover, the proton transfer process of BBTD-S→BBTD-D is easier to occur than that of BBTD→BBTD-S in S1 state.",

Here the authors present a detailed analysis of hydrogen-bonded complexes to assess the quality of Hartree-Fock (HF) and semiempirical methods in predicting the amount of charge transferred. The authors find that both HF and semiempirical methods systematically overestimate charge transfer when compared to MP2/6-311++G** calculations.

While the structural details of TM ions bound to metalloproteins are generally well understood via experimental and computational approaches, accurate studies describing the thermodynamics of TM ion binding are rare. Herein, we demonstrate that we can obtain accurate structural and absolute binding free energies of Co2+ and Ni2+ to the enzyme glyoxalase I using an optimized 12-6-4 (m12-6-4) potential. Critically, this model simultaneously reproduces the solvation free energy of the individual TM ions and reproduces the thermodynamics of TM ion-ligand coordination as well as the thermodynamics of TM ion binding to a protein active site unlike extant models. We find the incorporation of the thermodynamics associated with protonation state changes for the TM ion (un)binding to be crucial. The high accuracy of m12-6-4 potential in this study presents an accurate route to explore more complicated processes associated with TM cluster assembly and TM ion transport.",

        "title": "Computational studies of the farnesyltransferase ternary complex part II: The conformational activation of farnesyldiphosphate",
        "abstract": "Studies aimed at elucidating the reaction mechanism of farnesyltransferase (FTase), which catalyzes the prenylation of many cellular signaling proteins including Ras, has been an active area of research. Much is known regarding substrate binding and the impact of various catalytic site residues on catalysis. However, the molecular level details regarding the conformational rearrangement of farnesyldiphosphate (FPP), which has been proposed via structural analysis and mutagenesis studies to occur prior to the chemical step, is still poorly understood. Following on our previous computational characterization of the resting state of the FTase ternary complex, the thermodynamics of the conformational rearrangement step in the absence of magnesium was investigated for the wild type FTase and the Y300Fbeta mutant complexed with the peptide CVIM. In addition, we also explored the target dependence of the conformational activation step by perturbing isoleucine into a leucine (CVLM). The calculated free energy profiles of the proposed conformational transition confirm the presence of a stable intermediate state, which was identified only when the diphosphate is monoprotonated (FPP2-). The farnesyl group in the computed intermediate state assumes a conformation similar to that of the product complex, particularly for the first two isoprene units. We found that Y300beta can readily form hydrogen bonds with either of the phosphates of FPP. Removing the hydroxyl group on Y300beta does not significantly alter the thermodynamics of the conformational transition, but shifts the location of the intermediate farther away from the nucleophile by 0.5 A, which suggests that Y300beta facilitate the reaction by stabilizing the chemical step. Our results also showed an increased transition barrier height for CVLM (1.5 kcal/mol higher than that of CVIM). Although qualitatively consistent with the findings from the recent kinetic isotope experiments by Fierke and co-workers, the magnitude is not large enough to affect the rate-limiting step.",

        "abstract": "Farnesyltransferase (FTase) catalyzes the transfer of farnesyl from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to cysteine residues at or near the C-terminus of protein acceptors with a CaaX motif (a, aliphatic; X, Met). Farnesylation is a critical modification to many switch proteins involved in the extracellular signal transduction pathway, which facilitates their fixation on the cell membrane where the extracellular signal is processed. The malfunction caused by mutations in these proteins often causes uncontrolled cell reproduction and leads to tumor formation. FTase inhibitors have been extensively studied as potential anticancer agents in recent years, several of which have advanced to different phases of clinical trials. However, the mechanism of this biologically important enzyme has not been firmly established. Understanding how FTase recruits the FPP substrate is the first and foremost step toward further mechanistic investigations and the design of effective FTase inhibitors. Molecular dynamic simulations were carried out on the ternary structure of FTase complexed with the FPP substrate and an acetyl-capped tetrapeptide (acetyl-CVIM), which revealed that the FPP substrate maintains an inactive conformation and the binding of the diphosphate group can be largely attributed to residues R291beta, K164alpha, K294beta, and H248beta. The FPP substrate assumes an extended conformation in the binding site with restricted rotation of the backbone dihedral angles; however, it does not have a well-defined conformation when unbound in solution. This is evident from multinanosecond MD simulations of the FPP substrate in a vacuum and solution. Our conclusion is further supported by theoretical J coupling calculations. Our results on the FPP binding are in good agreement with previous experimental kinetic studies on FTase mutants. The hypothetical conformational activation of the FPP substrate is currently under investigation.",

Here we describe an assessment of semiempirical methods for discriminating native protein structures from decoy models. The discrimination of decoys entails an analysis of a large number of protein structures, and provides a large-scale validation of quantum mechanical methods and their ability to accurately model proteins. We combine our analysis of semiempirical methods with a comparison of an AMBER force field to discriminate decoys in conjunction with a continuum solvent model. Protein decoys provide a rigorous and reliable benchmark for the evaluation of scoring functions, not only in their ability to accurately identify native structures but also to be computationally tractable to sample a large set of non-native models.",

Experimentally, the azide ion binds to HCAII such that the structure of the active site is retained. This is interesting because the hydrogen bond interaction between the zinc-bound hydroxyl hydrogen and the hydroxyl oxygen of Thr-199 in the native enzyme is replaced by what formally appears to be a repulsive interaction between the hydroxyl oxygen of Thr-199 and the zinc-bound azide nitrogen. Two possibilities were considered for this system:  First, the binding of hydrogen azide (N3H) was considered, but we conclude based on experimental (i.e., pKas) and theoretical information that it is unlikely that this is what is bound to HCAII at physiological pH. When we bound the azide anion to the zinc ion in the HCAII active site we also found that the structure of the active site was retained. Upon further inspection, w...",

        "abstract": "Nb-silicide based alloys could be used at T > 1423 K in future aero-engines. Titanium is an important additive to these new alloys where it improves oxidation, fracture toughness and reduces density. The microstructures of the new alloys consist of an Nb solid solution, and silicides and other intermetallics can be present. Three Nb5Si3 polymorphs are known, namely αNb5Si3 (tI32 Cr5B3-type, D8l), βNb5Si3 (tI32 W5Si3-type, D8m) and γNb5Si3 (hP16 Mn5Si3-type, D88). In these 5-3 silicides Nb atoms can be substituted by Ti atoms. The type of stable Nb5Si3 depends on temperature and concentration of Ti addition and is important for the stability and properties of the alloys. The effect of increasing concentration of Ti on the transition temperature between the polymorphs has not been studied. In this work first-principles calculations were used to predict the stability and physical properties of the various Nb5Si3 silicides alloyed with Ti. Temperature-dependent enthalpies of formation were computed, and the transition temperature between the low (α) and high (β) temperature polymorphs of Nb5Si3 was found to decrease significantly with increasing Ti content. The γNb5Si3 was found to be stable only at high Ti concentrations, above approximately 50 at. % Ti. Calculation of physical properties and the Cauchy pressures, Pugh's index of ductility and Poisson ratio showed that as the Ti content increased, the bulk moduli of all silicides decreased, while the shear and elastic moduli and the Debye temperature increased for the αNb5Si3 and γNb5Si3 and decreased for βNb5Si3. With the addition of Ti the αNb5Si3 and γNb5Si3 became less ductile, whereas the βNb5Si3 became more ductile. When Ti was added in the αNb5Si3 and βNb5Si3 the linear thermal expansion coefficients of the silicides decreased, but the anisotropy of coefficient of thermal expansion did not change significantly.",

        "abstract": "Herein, we present results of a computational study on benzylpenicillin attachment to Lys199 of human serum albumin via an aminolysis reaction. The internal geometry of the reactive part of the system was taken from previous work at the B3LYP/6-31+G* level on the water-assisted aminolysis reaction of a penicillin model compound (Díaz, N.; Suárez, D.; Sordo, T. L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 122, 6710--6719). The protein environment around Lys199, the 6-acylamino side chain, and the 2-methyl groups of benzylpenicillin were relaxed by carrying out geometry optimizations with a hybrid QM/MM method (PM3/AMBER). Two different mechanistic routes were explored: a one-step water-assisted process and a carboxylate and water-assisted route in which the beta-lactam carboxylate and the ancillary water molecule mediate the proton transfer from the epsilon-amino group of Lys199 to the beta-lactam leaving N atom. The corresponding energy profiles in the protein combine the B3LYP/6-31+G* and PM3 energies of the reactive subsystem (benzylpenicillin + Lys199 side chain + the ancillary water molecule) and semiempirical PM3 energies of the entire system evaluated with a \"divide and conquer\" linear-scaling method. It is observed that penicillin haptenation to HSA can proceed through the water-assisted concerted mechanism which is calculated to have a high energy barrier of approximately 38 kcal/mol, in agreement with the experimentally observed slow reaction kinetics.",

This benchmark more than doubles the number of antibody-antigen complexes and corresponding affinities available in our previous benchmarks, providing an unprecedented view of the determinants of antibody recognition and insights into molecular flexibility. Initial assessments of docking and affinity prediction tools highlight the challenges posed by this diverse set of cases, which includes camelid nanobodies, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, and broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting viral glycoproteins.

        "abstract": "Determining the structure of a small molecule bound to a biological receptor (e.g., a protein implicated in a disease state) is a necessary step in structure-based drug design. The preferred conformation of a small molecule can change when bound to a protein, and a detailed knowledge of the preferred conformation(s) of a bound ligand can help in optimizing the affinity of a molecule for its receptor. However, the quality of a protein/ligand complex determined using X-ray crystallography is dependent on the size of the protein, the crystal quality, and the realized resolution. The energy restraints used in traditional X-ray refinement procedures typically use \"reduced\" (i.e., neglect of electrostatics and dispersion interactions) Engh and Huber force field models that, while quite suitable for modeling proteins, often are less suitable for small molecule structures due to a lack of validated parameters. Through the use of ab initio QM/MM-based X-ray refinement procedures, this shortcoming can be overcome especially in the active site or binding site of a small-molecule inhibitor. Herein, we demonstrate that ab initio QM/MM refinement of an inhibitor/protein complex provides insights into the binding of small molecules beyond what is available using more traditional refinement protocols. In particular, QM/MM refinement studies of benzamidinium derivatives show variable conformational preferences depending on the refinement protocol used and the nature of the active-site region.",

Clinicians should understand how to select the appropriate device and size for individual patients (or work with a physical therapist) and prescribe the device using the patient's health insurance plan. Canes can improve standing tolerance and gait by off-loading a weak or painful limb; however, they are the least stable of all assistive devices, and patients must have sufficient balance, upper body strength, and dexterity to use them safely. Older adults rarely use crutches because of the amount of upper body strength that is needed. Walkers provide a large base of support for patients who have poor balance or who have bilateral lower limb weakness and thus cannot always bear full weight on their legs. A two-wheel rolling walker is more functional and easier to maneuver than a standard walker with no wheels. A four-wheel rolling walker (rollator) can be used by higher-functioning individuals who do not need to fully off-load a lower limb and who need rest breaks for cardiopulmonary endurance reasons, but this is the least stable type of walker. Wheelchairs should be considered for patients who lack the lower body strength, balance, or endurance for ambulation. Proper sizing and patient education are essential to avoid skin breakdown. To use manual wheelchairs, patients must have sufficient upper body strength and coordination. Power chairs may be considered for patients who cannot operate a manual wheelchair or if they need the features of a power wheelchair.",

        "title": "The movable type method applied to protein–ligand binding",
        "abstract": "Accurately computing the free energy for biological processes like protein folding or protein-ligand association remains a challenging problem. Both describing the complex intermolecular forces involved and sampling the requisite configuration space make understanding these processes innately difficult. Herein, we address the sampling problem using a novel methodology we term \"movable type\". Conceptually it can be understood by analogy with the evolution of printing and, hence, the name movable type. For example, a common approach to the study of protein-ligand complexation involves taking a database of intact drug-like molecules and exhaustively docking them into a binding pocket. This is reminiscent of early woodblock printing where each page had to be laboriously created prior to printing a book. However, printing evolved to an approach where a database of symbols (letters, numerals, etc.) was created and then assembled using a movable type system, which allowed for the creation of all possible combinations of symbols on a given page, thereby, revolutionizing the dissemination of knowledge. Our movable type (MT) method involves the identification of all atom pairs seen in protein-ligand complexes and then creating two databases: one with their associated pairwise distant dependent energies and another associated with the probability of how these pairs can combine in terms of bonds, angles, dihedrals and non-bonded interactions. Combining these two databases coupled with the principles of statistical mechanics allows us to accurately estimate binding free energies as well as the pose of a ligand in a receptor. This method, by its mathematical construction, samples all of configuration space of a selected region (the protein active site here) in one shot without resorting to brute force sampling schemes involving Monte Carlo, genetic algorithms or molecular dynamics simulations making the methodology extremely efficient. Importantly, this method explores the free energy surface eliminating the need to estimate the enthalpy and entropy components individually. Finally, low free energy structures can be obtained via a free energy minimization procedure yielding all low free energy poses on a given free energy surface. Besides revolutionizing the protein-ligand docking and scoring problem this approach can be utilized in a wide range of applications in computational biology which involve the computation of free energies for systems with extensive phase spaces including protein folding, protein-protein docking and protein design.",

        "abstract": "CusCFBA is one of the metal efflux systems in Escherichia coli that is highly specific for its substrates, Cu(I) and Ag(I). It serves to protect the bacteria in environments that have lethal concentrations of these metals. The membrane fusion protein CusB is the periplasmic piece of CusCFBA, which has not been fully characterized by crystallography because of its extremely disordered N-terminal region. This region has both structural and functional importance because it has been experimentally proven to transfer the metal by itself from the metallochaperone CusF and to induce a structural change in the rest of CusB to increase Cu(I)/Ag(I) resistance. Understanding metal uptake from the periplasm is critical to gain insight into the mechanism of the whole CusCFBA pump, which makes resolving a structure for the N-terminal region necessary because it contains the metal binding site. We ran extensive molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the structural and dynamic properties of both the apo and Cu(I)-bound versions of the CusB N-terminal region. In contrast to its functional companion CusF, Cu(I) binding to the N-terminus of CusB causes only a slight, local stabilization around the metal site. The trajectories were analyzed in detail, revealing extensive structural disorder in both the apo and holo forms of the protein. CusB was further analyzed by breaking the protein up into three subdomains according to the extent of the observed disorder: the N- and C-terminal tails, the central beta strand motif, and the M21-M36 loop connecting the two metal-coordinating methionine residues. Most of the observed disorder was traced back to the tail regions, leading us to hypothesize that the latter two subdomains (residues 13-45) may form a functionally competent metal-binding domain because the tail regions appear to play no role in metal binding.",

In this study, we present an accurate and convenient means by which to include metal ions in the NMR structure determination process using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations constrained by NMR-derived data to obtain a realistic and physically viable description of the metal binding site(s). This method provides the framework to accurately portray the metal ions and its binding residues in a pseudo-bond or dummy-cation like approach, and is validated by quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) MD calculations constrained by NMR-derived data. To illustrate this approach, we refine the zinc coordination complex structure of the zinc sensing transcriptional repressor protein Staphylococcus aureus CzrA, generating over 130 ns of MD and QM/MM MD NMR-data compliant sampling. In addition to refining the first coordination shell structure of the Zn(II) ion, this protocol benefits from being performed in a periodically replicated solvation environment including long-range electrostatics. We determine that unrestrained (not based on NMR data) MD simulations correlated to the NMR data in a time-averaged ensemble. The accurate solution structure ensemble of the metal-bound protein accurately describes the role of conformational sampling in allosteric regulation of DNA binding by zinc and serves to validate our previous unrestrained MD simulations of CzrA. This methodology has potentially broad applicability in the structure determination of metal ion bound proteins, protein folding and metal template protein-design studies.",

This gives rise to the opportunity to engineer the active site to tune the functionality of terpenoids for therapeutic applications. The structural basis of substrate binding has been determined, but the source of the observed substrate selectivity and product regioselectivity cannot be completely understood on the basis of the static picture that the crystal structures of Orf2 and its complexes afford. The electron density and B-factors of the substrates, particularly those of 1,6-dihydroxynaphthalene, suggest significant conformational fluctuation in the Orf2 binding site. We thoroughly explored the binding of 1,6-dihydroxynaphthalene and quantitatively evaluated the relative free energies of three binding states that we identified in terms of a two-dimensional potential of mean force. The available experimental orientation, which gives the major prenylated product of 1,6-dihydroxynaphthalene, corresponds to the global free energy minimum. Two alternative binding states were identified on the calculated free energy surface, and both are readily accessible at 300 K. The alternative binding conformations were extracted from the potential of mean force calculation and were subjected to further validation against the experimental X-ray diffraction data using a refinement protocol supplemented with a hybrid quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical energy function. The agreement was excellent as indicated by the R and Rfree factors that were comparable to that obtained for the published orientation using a similar protocol. These binding states are the origin of the selectivity and regioselectivity in Orf2-catalyzed aromatic prenylations. Our analyses also suggest that Ser214 and Tyr288, forming hydrogen bonds with the alternative binding states of 1,6-dihydroxynaphthalene and flaviolin, are good candidates for site-directed mutagenesis, and changing them to, for example, their hydrophobic counterparts would affect the substrate selectivity and product regioselectivity.",

Using computational methods, we investigate the energetics of such zinc-mediated interactions in members of the ArsR/SmtB family of proteins (CzrA, SmtB, CadC, and NmtR) and the MarR family zinc-uptake repressor AdcR, which feature similar interactions, but in sites that differ widely in their allosteric responsiveness. We provide novel structural insight into previously uncharacterized allosteric forms of these proteins using computational methodologies. We find this metal-mediated interaction to be significantly stronger (∼8 kcal/mol) at functional allosteric metal binding sites compared to a nonresponsive site (CadC) and the apo-proteins. Simulations of the apo-proteins further reveal that the high interaction energy works to overcome the considerable disorder at these hydrogen-bonding sites and functions as a \"switch\" to lock in a weak DNA-binding conformation once metal is bound. These findings suggest a conserved functional role of metal-mediated second coordination shell hydrogen bonds at allosterically responsive sites in zinc-sensing transcription regulators.",

These methods have been shown to be capable of providing unique insights into a range of problems, but they are still limited to relatively short time scales, especially QM/MM models using ab initio methods. An intermediate approach between a QM based model and classical mechanics could help fill this time-scale gap and facilitate the study of a range of interesting problems. Reactive force fields represent the intermediate approach explored in this paper. A widely used reactive model is ReaxFF, which has largely been applied to materials science problems and is generally used as a stand-alone (i.e., the full system is modeled using ReaxFF). We report a hybrid ReaxFF/AMBER molecular dynamics (MD) tool, which introduces ReaxFF capabilities to capture bond breaking and formation within the AMBER MD software package. This tool enables us to study local reactive events in large systems at a fraction of the computational costs of QM/MM models. We describe the implementation of ReaxFF/AMBER, validate this implementation using a benzene molecule solvated in water, and compare its performance against a range of similar approaches. To illustrate the predictive capabilities of ReaxFF/AMBER, we carried out a Claisen rearrangement study in aqueous solution. In a first for ReaxFF, we were able to use AMBER's potential of mean force (PMF) capabilities to perform a PMF study on this organic reaction. The ability to capture local reaction events in large systems using combined ReaxFF/AMBER opens up a range of problems that can be tackled using this model to address both chemical and biological processes.",

Among metabolomics techniques, NMR spectroscopy is a sophisticated, powerful, and generally applicable spectroscopic tool that can be used to ascertain the correct structure of newly isolated biogenic molecules. However, accurate structure prediction using computational NMR techniques depends on how much of the relevant conformational space of a particular compound is considered. It is intrinsically challenging to calculate NMR chemical shifts using high-level DFT when the conformational space of a metabolite is extensive. In this work, we developed NMR chemical shift calculation protocols using a machine learning model in conjunction with standard DFT methods. The pipeline encompasses the following steps: (1) conformation generation using a force field (FF)-based method, (2) filtering the FF generated conformations using the ASE-ANI machine learning model, (3) clustering of the optimized conformations based on structural similarity to identify chemically unique conformations, (4) DFT structural optimization of the unique conformations, and (5) DFT NMR chemical shift calculation. This protocol can calculate the NMR chemical shifts of a set of molecules using any available combination of DFT theory, solvent model, and NMR-active nuclei, using both user-selected reference compounds and/or linear regression methods. Our protocol reduces the overall computational time by 2 orders of magnitude over methods that optimize the conformations using fully ab initio methods, while still producing good agreement with experimental observations. The complete protocol is designed in such a manner that makes the computation of chemical shifts tractable for a large number of conformationally flexible metabolites.",

The Boltzmann factor contribution of each pose to the configuration integral is computed and from there the free energy is obtained. Potential function uncertainties are estimated using a fragment-based error propagation method. This method has been applied to a set of small aromatic ligands complexed with T4 Lysozyme L99A mutant. Microstate energies have been determined with the force fields ff99SB and ff94, and the semiempirical method PM6DH2 in conjunction with continuum solvation models including Generalized Born (GB), the Conductor-like Screening Model (COSMO), and SMD. Of the methods studied, PM6DH2-based scoring gave binding free energy estimates, which yielded a good correlation to the experimental binding affinities (R2 = 0.7). All methods overestimated the calculated binding affinities.

        "abstract": "guanidino kinases contain a conserved cysteine residue that interacts with the non-nucleophilic eta1-nitrogen of the guanidino substrate. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that this cysteine is important, but not essential for activity. In human muscle creatine kinase (HMCK) this residue, Cys283, forms part of a conserved cysteine-proline-serine (CPS) motif and has a pKa about 3 pH units below that of a regular cysteine residue. Here we employ a computational approach to predict the contribution of residues in this motif to the unusually low cysteine pKa. We calculate that hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl and to the backbone amide of Ser285 would both contribute approximately 1 pH unit, while the presence of Pro284 in the motif lowers the pKa of Cys283 by a further 1.2 pH units. Using UV difference spectroscopy the pKa of the active site cysteine in WT HMCK and in the P284A, S285A, and C283S/S285C mutants was determined experimentally. The pKa values, although consistently about 0.5 pH unit lower, were in broad agreement with those predicted. The effect of each of these mutations on the pH-rate profile was also examined. The results show conclusively that, contrary to a previous report (Wang et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 11698-11705), Cys283 is not responsible for the pKa of 5.4 observed in the WT V/K(creatine) pH profile. Finally we use molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate that, in order to maintain the linear alignment necessary for associative inline transfer of a phosphoryl group, Cys283 needs to be ionized.",

All four receptor subtypes belong to the GTP-binding (G) protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family.

It is simultaneously demonstrated that this RD template satisfactorily compares with the first historical GPCR structure of bovine rhodopsin (Palczewski et al., 2000) and that homology-modeling of V2R, V1aR and OTR using opiate receptors as templates is rational, based on relatively high (20-60%) sequence homology among the set of 4 neurophyseal and 4 opiate receptors. YM087 was computer-docked to V1aR, V2R and OTR using the AutoDock (Olson et al., Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, USA) and subsequently relaxed using restrained simulated annealing and molecular dynamics, as implemented in AMBER program (Kollman et al., University of California, San Francisco, USA). From about 80 diverse configurations, sampled for each of the three ligand/receptor systems, 3 best energy-relaxed complexes were selected for mutual comparisons.

Simulation of the enzyme-substrate complex dimer systems showed asymmetric dynamics between the two monomers, in which the hydrogen bond pattern between the substrate and active site residues in the first and the second subunits supported the cooperative hydrogen bond (CH) and the catalytic diad (CD) mechanisms, respectively. On the other hand, only the CH mechanism was supported in the MD simulation of the enzyme-intermediate complex dimer. From MP2/6-31+G**//RHF/6-31G** calculations, we found the kinetic barriers for the two reaction mechanisms were similar. The CH route afforded a greater stabilization to the enolate intermediate than did the CD counterpart. Thus, the present computational studies indicate that the CH mechanism would be favored over the CD one in the catalytic action of KSI. However, the latter could not be ruled out conclusively because of the explicit appearance of a CD configuration in the MD trajectories of the enzyme-substrate complex and because of the similar intrinsic activation barrier for the CH and CD mechanisms. The appearance of configurations that favor the CD pathway is rationalized in terms of a model in which the KSI-substrate complex does not have a strong preference for one hydrogen bonding pattern over another, while the KSI-intermediate complex favors a cooperative hydrogen bond pattern in order to stabilize the reaction intermediate. This hypothesis is supported by the ab initio calculations which indicate that the CH intermediate is more stable than the CD one by approximately 6.3 kcal/mol.",

The chemistry step, represented by the burst rates, was not pH-dependent, which is consistent with our proposed mechanism that the 4-carboxamide of AICAR assists proton shuttling. Quantum chemical calculations on a model system of 5-amino-4-carboxamide imidazole (AICA) and formamide using the B3LYP/6-31G level of theory confirmed that the 4-carboxamide participated in the proton-shuttling mechanism. The result also indicated that the amide-assisted mechanism is concerted such that the proton transfers from the 5-amino group to the formamide are simultaneous with nucleophilic attack by the 5-amino group. Because the process does not lead to a kinetically stable intermediate, the intramolecular proton transfer from the 5-amino group through the 4-carboxamide to the formamide proceeds in the same transition state. Interestingly, the calculations predicted that protonation of the N3 of the imidazole of AICA would reduce the energy barrier significantly. However, the pK(a) of the imidazole of AICAR was determined to be 3.23 +/- 0.01 by NMR titration, and AICAR is likely to bind to the enzyme with its imidazole in the free base form. An alternative pathway was suggested by modeling Lys266 to have a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the N3 of the imidazole of AICAR. Lys266 has been implicated in catalysis based on mutagenesis studies and the recent X-ray structure of AICAR Tfase. The quantum chemical calculations on a model system that contains AICA complexed with CH3NH3+ as a mimic of the Lys residue confirmed that such an interaction lowered the activation energy of the reaction and likewise implicated the 4-carboxamide. To experimentally verify this hypothesis, we prepared the K266R mutant and found that its kcat is reduced by 150-fold from that of the wild type without changes in substrate and cofactor Km values. The kcat-pH profile indicated virtually no pH-dependence in the pH range 6-10.5. The results suggest that the ammonium moiety of Lys or Arg is important in catalysis, most likely acting as a general acid catalyst with a pK(a) value greater than 10.5. The H267A mutant was also prepared since His267 has been found in the active site and implicated in catalysis. The mutant enzyme showed no detectable activity while retaining its binding affinity for substrate, indicating that it plays a critical role in catalysis. We propose that His267 interacts with Lys266 to aid in the precise positioning of the general acid catalyst to the N3 of the imidazole of AICAR.",

The outcome of this energy expansion is compared to the total receptor-ligand binding energy at the Hartree-Fock, density functional theory, and semiempirical levels of theory. We find that the sum of the pairwise interaction energies approximates the total binding energy to ∼82% for HF and to >95% for both the M06-L density functional and PM6-DH2 semiempirical method. The contribution of the three-body interactions amounts to 18.7%, 3.8%, and 1.4% for HF, M06-L, and PM6-DH2, respectively. We find that the expansion can be safely truncated after n=3. That is, the contribution of the interactions involving more than three parties to the total binding energy of Indinavir to the HIV II protease receptor is negligible. Overall, we find that the two-body terms represent a good approximation to the total binding energy of the system, which points to pairwise additivity in the present case. This basic principle of pairwise additivity is utilized in fragment-based drug design approaches and our results support its continued use. The present results can also aid in the validation of non-bonded terms contained within common force fields and in the correction of systematic errors in physics-based score functions.",

        "abstract": "Quantum chemistry enables to study systems with chemical accuracy (<1 kcal/mol from experiment) but is restricted to a handful of atoms due to its computational expense. This has led to ongoing interest to optimize and simplify these methods while retaining accuracy. Implementing quantum mechanical (QM) methods on modern hardware such as multiple-GPUs is one example of how the field is optimizing performance. Multiscale approaches like the so-called QM/molecular mechanical method are gaining popularity in drug discovery because they focus the application of QM methods on the region of choice (e.g., the binding site), while using efficient MM models to represent less relevant areas. The creation of simplified QM methods is another example, including the use of machine learning to create ultra-fast and accurate QM models. Herein, we summarize recent advancements in the development of optimized QM methods that enhance our ability to use these methods in computer aided drug discovery.",

        "title": "Confronting racism in chemistry journals",
        "abstract": "nt the terrible reality that systemic racism and discrimination impacts the daily personal and professional lives of many members of the scientific community and broader society. In the U.S., the brutal killing of George Floyd while in police custody is one of the most recent examples of the centuries of systemic violence suffered by Black Americans. This moment and its aftermath lay bare the legacies of racism and its exclusionary practices. Let us be clear: we, the Editors, Staff, and Governance Members of ACS Publications condemn the tragic deaths of Black people and stand in solidarity with Black members of the science and engineering community. Moreover, ACS condemns racism, discrimination, and harassment in all forms. We will not tolerate practices and viewpoints that exclude or demean any member of our community. Despite these good intentions, we recognize that our community has not done enough to provide an environment for Black chemists to thrive. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, Chairwoman of the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology said, \"So far, we have gotten by with a STEM workforce that does not come close to representing the diversity of our nation. However, if we continue to leave behind so much of our nation's brainpower, we cannot succeed.\" 1 Indeed, the U.S. National Science Foundation notes that Blacks and other under-represented minority groups continue to be under-represented in science and engineering education and employment. 2 What is abundantly clear in this moment is that this lack of representation is a symptom of systemic racism across all levels of education and professional life. We know that supportive words are not enough. We must develop and implement a concrete plan for changing our trajectory. Publications and citations are academic currency, and while we like to think publishing a manuscript is \"just about the science\", we know that is not true for everyone. We have seen the biases (largely through the lens of gender and in Western countries because of the limitations in bibliometric analyses) and applaud our colleagues at the RSC for their massive study that explored these gender barriers in the publishing pipeline 3 and their recent Inclusion and Diversity Framework. 4 At the present time, unfortunately, less is known about the effects of race and ethnicity on publishing success. A study published in PeerJ, however, found that unprofessional reviewer comments had a disproportionate effect on authors from under-represented groups. 5 As the world's leading society publisher, we have a responsibility to aggressively combat bias in all aspects of the publishing process, including systemic under-representation of Blacks in this endeavor (no ACS journal is currently led by a Black Editor-in-Chief). Within ACS Publications, we actively track gender and geographic diversity of editors, advisors, authors, and reviewers, and we anecdotally report on race of editors. Diversity encompasses many more dimensions than these, and we acknowledge that we can do much more than we have. We affirm that diversity and inclusion strengthen the research community and its impact, and we are committed to developing, implementing, tracking, and reporting on our progress to ensure that our editors, advisors, reviewers, and authors are more diverse and that all authors receive the same fair treatment and opportunity to publish in our journals. We acknowledge that we do not have all the answers now, but we seek to hear from and listen to our community on how we can improve our journals to be more diverse and inclusive. As first steps, we commit to the taking the following actions: • Gathering and making public our baseline statistics on diversity within our journals, encompassing our editors, advisors, reviewers, and authors; annually reporting on progress • Training new and existing editors to recognize and interrupt bias in peer review • Including diversity of journal contributors as an explicit measurement of Editor-in-Chief performance • Appointing an ombudsperson to serve as a liaison between Editors and our Community • Developing an actionable diversity plan for each ACS journal These are only initial plans and the start of a conversation: other ideas are beginning to germinate, and we commit to sharing them with you regularly. We invite you contribute your ideas on how we can do better via our Axial website. We are listening carefully. We encourage you to take immediate action in your own circles. In a recent editorial, JACS Associate Editor Melanie Sanford 6 offered practical steps to take now. Take a moment to find out more about these actions and how to bring them into your work and your life. We all have a responsibility to eradicate racism and discrimination in the science and engineering community; indeed, to make a real difference, we need to be antiracist. The tragic events we have seen in the Black community provide great urgency to this goal. The work will be difficult and will force us to confront hard realities about our beliefs and actions. We fully expect that you, and everyone in the community, will hold us accountable.",

        "abstract": "Herein we provide high-precision validation tests of the latest GPU-accelerated free energy code in AMBER. We demonstrate that consistent free energy results are obtained in both the gas phase and in solution. We first show, in the context of thermodynamic integration (TI), that the results are invariant with respect to \"split\" (e.g., stepwise decharge-vdW-recharge) versus \"unified\" protocols. This brought to light a subtle inconsistency in previous versions of AMBER that was traced to the improper treatment of 1-4 vdW and electrostatic interactions involving atoms across the softcore boundary. We illustrate that under the assumption that the ensembles produced by different legs of the alchemical transformation between molecules A and B in the gas phase and aqueous phase are very small, the inconsistency in the relative hydration free energy ΔΔGhydr[A → B] = ΔGaq[A → B] - ΔGgas[A → B] is minimal. However, for general cases where the ensembles are shown to be substantially different, as expected in ligand-protein binding applications, these errors can be large. Finally, we demonstrate that results for relative hydration free energy simulations are independent of TI or multistate Bennett's acceptance ratio (MBAR) analysis, invariant to the specific choice of the softcore region, and in agreement with results derived from absolute hydration free energy values.",

Herein we examine the conformational properties of donepezil and we re-examine the donepezil-AChE crystal structure using combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) X-ray refinement tools. Donepezil's conformational energy surface was explored using the M06 suite of density functionals and with the MP2/complete basis set (CBS) method using the aug-cc-pVXZ (X = D and T) basis sets. The donepezil-AChE complex (PDB 1EVE) was also re-refined through a parallel QM/MM X-ray refinement approach based on an in-house ab initio code QUICK, which uses the message passing interface (MPI) in a distributed SCF algorithm to accelerate the calculation via parallelization. In the QM/MM re-refined donepezil structure, coordinate errors that previously existed in the PDB deposited geometry were improved leading to an improvement of the modeling of the interaction between donepezil and the aromatic side chains located in the AChE active site gorge. As a result of the re-refinement there was a 93% reduction in the donepezil conformational strain energy versus the original PDB structure. The results of the present effort offer further detailed structural and biochemical inhibitor-AChE information for the continued development of more effective and palliative treatments of Alzheimer disease.",

        "abstract": "Two families of binding affinity estimation methodologies are described which were utilized in the SAMPL3 trypsin/fragment binding affinity challenge. The first is a free energy decomposition scheme based on a thermodynamic cycle, which included separate contributions from enthalpy and entropy of binding as well as a solvent contribution. Enthalpic contributions were estimated with PM6-DH2 semiempirical quantum mechanical interaction energies, which were modified with a statistical error correction procedure. Entropic contributions were estimated with the rigid-rotor harmonic approximation, and solvent contributions to the free energy were estimated with several different methods. The second general methodology is the empirical score LISA, which contains several physics-based terms trained with the large PDBBind database of protein/ligand complexes. Here we also introduce LISA+, an updated version of LISA which, prior to scoring, classifies systems into one of four classes based on a ligand's hydrophobicity and molecular weight. Each version of the two methodologies (a total of 11 methods) was trained against a compiled set of known trypsin binders available in the Protein Data Bank to yield scaling parameters for linear regression models. Both raw and scaled scores were submitted to SAMPL3. Variants of LISA showed relatively low absolute errors but also low correlation with experiment, while the free energy decomposition methods had modest success when scaling factors were included. Nonetheless, re-scaled LISA yielded the best predictions in the challenge in terms of RMS error, and six of these models placed in the top ten best predictions by RMS error. This work highlights some of the difficulties of predicting binding affinities of small molecular fragments to protein receptors as well as the benefit of using training data.",

The complex is comprised of three proteins: the CusA transmembrane pump, the CusB soluble adaptor protein, and the CusC outer-membrane pore, and additionally requires the periplasmic metallochaperone CusF. Here we used spectroscopic and kinetic tools to probe the mechanism of copper transfer between CusF and CusB using selenomethionine labeling of the metal-binding Met residues coupled to RFQ-XAS at the Se and Cu edges. The results indicate fast formation of a protein-protein complex followed by slower intra-complex metal transfer. An intermediate coordinated by ligands from each protein forms in 100 ms. Stopped-flow fluorescence of the capping CusF-W44 tryptophan that is quenched by metal transfer also supports this mechanism. The rate constants validate a process in which shared-ligand complex formation assists protein association, providing a driving force that raises the rate into the diffusion-limited regime.",

As such, this protein represents a major drug target in AIDS therapy, but emerging resistance to antiretroviral inhibitor cocktails, caused by high viral mutation rates, represents a significant challenge in AIDS treatment. Many mutations are not located within the active site or binding pocket, nor they do significantly modify the three-dimensional structural organization of the enzyme; hence, the mechanism(s) by which they alter inhibitor affinity for the protease remains uncertain. In this article, we present an all-atom computational analysis of the dynamic residue-residue coordination between the active site residues and the rest of the protein and of the energetic properties of different HIV-1 PR complexes. We analyze both the wild-type form and mutated forms that induce drug resistance. In particular, the results show differences between the wild type and the mutants in their mechanism of dynamic coordination, in the signal propagation between the active site residues and the rest of the protein, and in the energy networks responsible for the stabilization of the bound inhibitor conformation. Finally, we propose a dynamic and energetic explanation for HIV-1 protease drug resistance, and, through this model, we identify a possible new site that could be helpful in the design of a new family of HIV-1 PR allosteric inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Nickel-responsive protein NikR regulates the nickel uptake in nickel-dependent bacteria by interacting with the operator of nikABCDE and subsequently repressing the transcription of NikABCDE, an ABC-type nickel transporter system. The function of NikR and its affinity for the operator DNA is highly conformation-dependent, which has been confirmed by three independent crystallographic studies on NikR proteins from different bacteria. Depending on the intracellular nickel concentration, NikR is able to adopt either the open form or one of the two closed forms (cis and trans) that differ in the domain-domain arrangement. Only the closed cis form is optimal for DNA binding. We examined the low-resolution vibrational spectrum of NikR in each conformational form using the elastic network model and observed large-scale domain-domain vibrations that are closely related to the conformational transitions required for function, particularly the symmetric bending mode and the asymmetric twisting mode. This analysis on the intrinsic dynamics coded in the three-dimensional molecular construct allows us to examine the proposed mechanisms of NikR regulation from the standpoint of protein collective motions. Our findings further support the three-state equilibrium hypothesis proposed by others, and imply that an isolated closed cis form may be dynamically unstable but can be stabilized by DNA binding. However, we also found that the simple C(alpha)-model used in the current analysis is insufficient to capture the impact of nickel binding on the protein dynamics, for which an all-atom model with detailed atom typing is more appropriate.",

        "abstract": "The reactive force field (ReaxFF) model bridges the gap between traditional classical models and quantum mechanical (QM) models by incorporating dynamic bonding and polarizability. To achieve realistic simulations using ReaxFF, model parameters must be optimized against high fidelity training data which typically come from QM calculations. Existing parameter optimization methods for ReaxFF consist of black box techniques using genetic algorithms or Monte Carlo methods. Due to the stochastic behavior of these methods, the optimization process oftentimes requires millions of error evaluations for complex parameter fitting tasks, thereby significantly hampering the rapid development of high quality parameter sets. Rapid optimization of the parameters is essential for developing and refining Reax force fields because producing a force field which exhibits empirical accuracy in terms of dynamics typically requires multiple refinements to the training data as well as to the parameters under optimization. In this work, we present JAX-ReaxFF, a novel software tool that leverages modern machine learning infrastructure to enable fast optimization of ReaxFF parameters. By calculating gradients of the loss function using the JAX library, JAX-ReaxFF utilizes highly effective local optimization methods that are initiated from multiple guesses in the high dimensional optimization space to obtain high quality results. Leveraging the architectural portability of the JAX framework, JAX-ReaxFF can execute efficiently on multicore CPUs, graphics processing units (GPUs), or even tensor processing units (TPUs). As a result of using the gradient information and modern hardware accelerators, we are able to decrease ReaxFF parameter optimization time from days to mere minutes. Furthermore, the JAX-ReaxFF framework can also serve as a sandbox environment for domain scientists to explore customizing the ReaxFF functional form for more accurate modeling.",

Herein we address this issue by generating the relevant configurational states of a protein flap on the molecular energy landscape using an approach we call MTFlex-b and then following this with a procedure to estimate the free energy associated with the motion of the flap region. To illustrate our overall workflow, we explored the free energy changes in the streptavidin/biotin system upon introducing conformational flexibility in loop3-4 in the biotin unbound ( apo) and bound ( holo) state. The free energy surfaces were created using the Movable Type free energy method, and for further validation, we compared them to potential of mean force (PMF) generated free energy surfaces using MD simulations employing the FF99SBILDN and FF14SB force fields. We also estimated the free energy thermodynamic cycle using an ensemble of closed-like and open-like end states for the ligand unbound and bound states and estimated the binding free energy to be approximately -16.2 kcal/mol (experimental -18.3 kcal/mol). The good agreement between MTFlex-b in combination with the MT method with experiment and MD simulations supports the effectiveness of our strategy in obtaining unique insights into the motions in proteins that can then be used in a range of biological and biomedical applications.",

The challenge included three hosts, acyclic Cucurbit[2]uril and two octa-acids with and without methylation at the entrance to their binding cavities. Each host was associated with 6-10 guest molecules. The MT method extrapolates local energy landscapes around particular molecular states and estimates the free energy by Monte Carlo integration over these landscapes. Two blind submissions pairing MT with variants of the KECSA potential function yielded mean unsigned errors of 1.26 and 1.53 kcal/mol for the non-methylated octa-acid, 2.83 and 3.06 kcal/mol for the methylated octa-acid, and 2.77 and 3.36 kcal/mol for Cucurbit[2]uril host. While our results are in reasonable agreement with experiment, we focused on particular cases in which our estimates gave incorrect results, particularly with regard to association between the octa-acids and an adamantane derivative. Working on the hypothesis that differential solvation effects play a role in effecting computed binding affinities for the parent octa-acid and the methylated octa-acid and that the ligands bind inside the pockets (rather than on the surface) we devised a new solvent accessible surface area term to better quantify solvation energy contributions in MT based studies. To further explore this issue a, molecular dynamics potential of mean force (PMF) study indicates that, as found by our docking calculations, the stable binding mode for this ligand is inside (rather than surface bound) the octa-acid cavity whether the entrance is methylated or not. The PMF studies also obtained the correct order for the methylation-induced change in binding affinities and associated the difference, to a large extent to differential solvation effects. Overall, the SAMPL5 challenge yielded in improvements our solvation modeling and also demonstrated the need for thorough validation of input data integrity prior to any computational analysis.",

The key challenges to effective solvation modeling center on the choice of potential function and configurational sampling. Herein, an energy sampling approach termed the “Movable Type” (MT) method, and a statistical energy function for solvation modeling, “Knowledge-based and Empirical Combined Scoring Algorithm” (KECSA) are developed and utilized to create an implicit solvation model: KECSA-Movable Type Implicit Solvation Model (KMTISM) suitable for the study of chemical and biological systems. KMTISM is an implicit solvation model, but the MT method performs energy sampling at the atom pairwise level. For a specific molecular system, the MT method collects energies from prebuilt databases for the requisite atom pairs at all relevant distance ranges, which by its very construction encodes all possible molecular configurations simultaneously. Unlike traditional statistical energy functions, KECSA converts structural statistical information into categorized atom pairwise interaction energies as a function of the radial distance instead of a mean force energy function. Within the implicit solvent model approximation, aqueous solvation free energies are then obtained from the NVT ensemble partition function generated by the MT method. Validation is performed against several subsets selected from the Minnesota Solvation Database v2012. Results are compared with several solvation free energy calculation methods, including a one-to-one comparison against two commonly used classical implicit solvation models: MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA. Comparison against a quantum mechanics based polarizable continuum model is also discussed (Cramer and Truhlar’s Solvation Model 12).",

Though all 552 residues of this species occur naturally, quantum-mechanics-based force-field parametrization was required to accurately represent the four nickel-centers in the nickel-bound form. Global conformational analysis of the three 100-ns-long simulations indicates slow conformational kinetics and independent DNA binding domain motion. Correlation and flexibility analysis revealed regions of high structural and dynamical importance. A striking relationship was observed between regions with high levels of structural importance and regions with known biological importance.

        "abstract": "An analysis of the free energy perturbation (FEP) method is presented that attempts to evaluate the efficacy of the FEP method in the drug discovery process. To accomplish this we have evaluated whether the FEP technique can accurately predict energetic and structural quantities relating to the inhibition of human carbonic anhydrase II (HCAII) by sulfonamides. Three well-characterized (both structurally and energetically) sulfonamide inhibitors of HCAII were examined in this study, 1a, 1b, and 1c. Results from FEP simulations on these compounds indicate that the FEP method can predict energetic trends reasonably well; however, the FEP method was less successful in reproducing detailed structural data. In particular, an expected movement of His-64 when inhibitor 1c was bound did not occur. We conclude that the FEP method can be used to determine relative free energies of binding but cannot be relied upon to reproduce subtle geometric changes.",

        "abstract": "Accurately predicting receptor-ligand binding free energies is one of the holy grails of computational chemistry with many applications in chemistry and biology. Many successes have been reported, but issues relating to sampling and force field accuracy remain significant issues affecting our ability to reliably calculate binding free energies. In order to explore these issues in more detail we have examined a series of small host-guest complexes from the SAMPL6 blind challenge, namely octa-acids (OAs)-guest complexes and Curcurbit[8]uril (CB8)-guest complexes. Specifically, potential of mean force studies using umbrella sampling combined with the weighted histogram method were carried out on both systems with both known and unknown binding affinities. We find that using standard force fields and straightforward simulation protocols we are able to obtain satisfactory results, but that simply scaling our results allows us to significantly improve our predictive ability for the unknown test sets: the overall RMSD of the binding free energy versus experiment is reduced from 5.59 to 2.36 kcal/mol; for the CB8 test system, the RMSD goes from 8.04 to 3.51 kcal/mol, while for the OAs test system, the RSMD goes from 2.89 to 0.95 kcal/mol. The scaling approach was inspired by studies on structurally related known benchmark sets: by simply scaling, the RMSD was reduced from 6.23 to 1.19 kcal/mol and from 2.96 to 0.62 kcal/mol for the CB8 benchmark system and the OA benchmark system, respectively. We find this scaling procedure to correct absolute binding affinities to be highly effective especially when working across a \"congeneric\" series with similar charge states. It is less successful when applied to mixed ligands with varied charges and chemical characteristics, but improvement is still realized in the present case. This approach suggests that there are large systematic errors in absolute binding free energy calculations that can be straightforwardly accounted for using a scaling procedure. Random errors are still an issue, but near chemical accuracy can be obtained using the present strategy in select cases.",

J. Phys. Chem. B 2009, 113, 10380-10388). Interestingly, the calculated values based on an NMR structure are more accurate than those based on a high-resolution X-ray strucure because the NMR structure was refined using a large number of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) whereas the hydrogen atoms were added into the X-ray structure in idealized positions, confirming that the postioning of the hydrogen atoms relative to the backbone atoms is important to the accuracy of J coupling constant prediction. By comparing three Karplus equations, our results have demonstrated that hydrogen bonding, substituent and electrostatic effects could have significant impacts on vicinal J couplings even though they depend mostly on the intervening dihedral angles. The root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of the calculated (3)J(H(N),H(α)), (3)J(H(N),C(β)), (3)J(H(N),C') values based on the NMR structure are 0.52, 0.25, and 0.35 Hz, respectively, after taking the dynamic effect into consideration. The excellent accuracy demonstrates that our AF-QM/MM approach is a useful tool to study the relationship between J coupling constants and the structure and dynamics of proteins.",

Sixty-six all-trans-RA (ATRA) and forty-eight 9-cis-RA energy minimum conformers were identified via HF/6-31G* geometry optimizations in vacuo. Their relative conformational energies were estimated utilizing the M06, M06-2x and MP2 methods combined with the 6-311+G(d,p), aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets, as well as complete basis set MP2 extrapolations using the latter two basis sets. Single-point energy calculations performed with the M06-2x density functional were found to yield similar results to MP2/CBS for the low-energy retinoic acid conformations. Not unexpectedly, the conformational propensities of retinoic acid were governed by the orientation and arrangement of the torsion angles associated with the polyene tail. We also used previously reported QM/MM X-ray refinement results on four ATRA-protein crystal structures plus one newly refined 9-cis-RA complex (PDB ID 1XDK) in order to investigate the conformational preferences of bound retinoic acid. In the re-refined RA conformers the conjugated double bonds are nearly coplanar, which is consistent with the global minimum identified by the Omega/QM method rather than the corresponding crystallographically determined conformations given in the PDB. Consequently, a 91.3% average reduction of the local strain energy in the gas phase, as well as 92.1% in PCM solvent, was observed using the QM/MM refined structures versus the PDB deposited RA conformations. These results thus demonstrate that our QM/MM X-ray refinement approach can significantly enhance the quality of X-ray crystal structures refined by conventional refinement protocols, thereby providing reliable drug-target structural information for use in structure-based drug discovery applications.",

In recent years, density functional theory (DFT) has become a popular method for calculating molecular properties for a vast array of systems varying in size from small organic molecules to large biological compounds such as proteins. In this work we assess the ability of many DFT methods to accurately determine atomic and molecular properties for small molecules containing elements commonly found in proteins, DNA, and RNA. These properties include bond lengths, bond angles, ground state vibrational frequencies, electron affinities, ionization potentials, heats of formation, hydrogen bond interaction energies, conformational energies, and reaction barrier heights. Calculations are carried out with the 3-21G*, 6-31G*, 3-21+G*, 6-31+G*, 6-31++G*, cc-pVxZ, and aug-cc-pVxZ (x=D,T) basis sets, while bond distance and bond angle calculations are also done using the cc-pVQZ and aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets. Members of the popular functional classes, namely, LSDA, GGA, meta-GGA, hybrid-GGA, and hybrid-meta-GGA, are considered in this work. For the purpose of comparison, Hartree-Fock (HF) and second order many-body perturbation (MP2) methods are also assessed in terms of their ability to determine these physical properties. Ultimately, it is observed that the split valence bases of the 6-31G variety provide accuracies similar to those of the more computationally expensive Dunning type basis sets. Another conclusion from this survey is that the hybrid-meta-GGA functionals are typically among the most accurate functionals for all of the properties examined in this work.",

        "abstract": "Protein chemical shift perturbations (CSPs), upon ligand binding, can be used to refine the structure of a protein-ligand complex by comparing experimental CSPs with calculated CSPs for any given set of structural coordinates. Herein, we describe a fast and accurate methodology that opens up new opportunities for improving the quality of protein-ligand complexes using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based approaches by focusing on the effect of the ligand on the protein. The new computational approach, 1H empirical chemical shift perturbation (HECSP), has been developed to rapidly calculate ligand binding-induced 1H CSPs in a protein. Given the dearth of experimental information by which a model could be derived, we employed high-quality density functional theory (DFT) computations using the automated fragmentation quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics approach to derive a database of ligand-induced CSPs on a series of protein-ligand complexes. Overall, the empirical HECSP model yielded correlation coefficients between its predicted and DFT-computed values of 0.897 (1HA), 0.971 (1HN), and 0.945 (side chain 1H) with root-mean-square errors of 0.151 (1HA), 0.199 (1HN), and 0.257 ppm (side chain 1H), respectively. Using the HECSP model, we developed a scoring function (NMRScore_P). We describe two applications of NMRScore_P on two complex systems and demonstrate that the method can distinguish native ligand poses from decoys and refine protein-ligand complex structures. We provide further refined models for both complexes, which satisfy the observed 1H CSPs in experiments. In conclusion, HECSP coupled with NMRScore_P provides an accurate and rapid platform by which protein-ligand complexes can be refined using NMR-derived information.",

Furthermore, increasing the size of the ensemble by sampling and averaging over additional independent configurations reduces uncertainties in free energy dramatically. This finding suggests a general strategy that could be utilized as a post-hoc correction for improved precision in virtual screening and free energy estimation.",

        "abstract": "A method of solving the mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) Hamiltonian in solution, using the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation to calculate partial charges and solvation free energies, is presented. This method combines a linear scaling divide and conquer semiempirical algorithm with the PB equation in a QM/MM framework, allowing only a specified region's charges to be polarized by the solvent while using fixed charges from a MM force field for the remaining system. This can save time over a full QM implementation, only requiring self-consistency to be achieved in a small QM region, while giving comparable results. The solvation free energy of pentapeptides capped with an acetyl group (ACE) at the N-terminus and an N-methylamine group at the C-terminus (NME) was used to study the accuracy of this method as well as several small protein systems. The solvation free energies for the QM/MM implementation compare well with a full QM treatment of the same system, giving reasonable representations for the solvation free energy of the entire system independent of the QM region's size. In the case of the pentapeptides, the average error was only 4.9 kcal/mol with the smallest QM region. This mixed method will allow an accurate description of solvation effects in an area of interest, such as an active site, using mixed QM/MM Hamiltonians. Possible applications for this method include protein-ligand binding and reaction mechanism studies.",

Calculations were carried out at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory and the counterpoise scheme of Boys and Bernardi was employed to account for the basis set superposition error. The most striking result obtained here is that the SBB phenyl ring interacts at least as strongly with the proline pyrrolidine ring as with the phenylalanine phenyl ring, which is surprising because aromatic-aromatic interactions have long been thought to be particularly favorable in protein and protein-ligand structure. Comparison of the MP2 binding energies to those obtained with the Hartree-Fock method indicates that the attraction between the proline pyrrolidine ring and the SBB phenyl ring is largely attributable to dispersion forces. These favorable interactions between pyrrolidine and phenyl rings may have important implications in protein structure because there is potential for proline residues to interact with phenylalanine residues in a fashion analogous to that seen here. A preliminary protein data bank search indicates that the proline-phenylalanine contacts are about 40% as common as those between two phenylalanines. It is also found here that the number and pattern of fluorine substituents on the SBB phenyl ring is much less important in determining the SBB-HCAII binding energy than the relative geometric configuration of the interacting pairs.",

        "abstract": "The local spin density approximation (LSDA) approximation was one of the first density functional theory (DFT) methods employed to calculate atomic and molecular properties. As newer, more sophisticated methods, such as BLYP and B3LYP, were developed, the LSDA approximation has grown less popular for molecular systems. In this paper we revisit the LSDA method and investigate a simple way to improve the results that can be obtained using this approximation. By scaling the contribution of the local correlation to the SVWNV functional, improved results can be obtained for heats of formation, ionization potentials, electron affinities, bond angles, bond distances, vibrational frequencies, conformational energies, interaction energies, and barrier heights. The results of our studies show that scaling the SVWNV functional yields heats of formations with average unsigned errors up to about nine times smaller than those of the standard SVWNV functional. The decreases in the errors of other properties studied in this work were not as dramatic as those of the heat of formation but were, in most cases, significant. There is a notable time saving in this density only functional. For a 9-alanine system SVWNV is 55% faster than B3LYP and 40% faster than BLYP at a 3-21G* basis set. Based on our observations we propose an improved SVWNV density functional that is suitable for the study of molecular systems at a fraction of the cost of more sophisticated DFT methods, which also produces reasonable accuracy at small basis sets. One type of application for which the improved SVWNV functional would be extremely well suited is QM/QM methods where a fairly inexpensive method is needed for the larger part of a system that is treated at a lower level of theory.",

        "abstract": "Attention mechanisms have led to many breakthroughs in sequential data modeling but have yet to be incorporated into any generative algorithms for molecular design. Here we explore the impact of adding self-attention layers to generative β-VAE models and show that those with attention are able to learn a complex \"molecular grammar\" while improving performance on downstream tasks such as accurately sampling from the latent space (\"model memory\") or exploring novel chemistries not present in the training data. There is a notable relationship between a model's architecture, the structure of its latent memory and its performance during inference. We demonstrate that there is an unavoidable tradeoff between model exploration and validity that is a function of the complexity of the latent memory. However, novel sampling schemes may be used that optimize this tradeoff. We anticipate that attention will play an important role in future molecular design algorithms that can make efficient use of the detailed molecular substructures learned by the transformer.",

Differing from traditional systematic and stochastic searching algorithms, this method uses Boltzmann energy information to facilitate the selection of the best conformations. The generated ensembles provided good coverage of the available conformational space including available crystal structures. Furthermore, our approach directly provides the solvation free energies and the relative gas and aqueous phase free energies for all generated conformers. The method is validated by a thorough analysis of thrombin ligands as well as against structures extracted from both the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). An in-depth comparison between OMEGA and MT-CS is presented to illustrate the differences between the two conformational searching strategies, i.e., energy-based versus free energy-based searching. These studies demonstrate that our MT-based ligand conformational search algorithm is a powerful approach to delineate the conformational ensembles of molecular species on free energy surfaces.",

There are series of protein bound RA complexes available in the protein databank (PDB), which provides a broad range of information about the different bioactive conformations of RA. To gain further insights into the observed bioactive RA conformations we applied quantum mechanic (QM)/molecular mechanic (MM) approaches to re-refine the available RA protein-ligand complexes. MP2 complete basis set (CBS) extrapolations single energy calculations are also carried out for both the experimental conformations and QM optimized geometries of RA in the gas as well as solution phase. The results demonstrate that the re-refined structures show better geometries for RA than seen in the originally deposited PDB structures through the use of QMs for the ligand in the X-ray refinement procedure. QM/MM re-refined conformations also reduced the computed strain energies found in the deposited crystal conformations for RA. Finally, the dependence of ligand strain on resolution is analyzed.

        "abstract": "Studies aimed at elucidating the unknown Mg2+ binding site in protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) are reported. FTase catalyzes the transfer of a farnesyl group to a conserved cysteine residue (Cys1p) on a target protein, an important step for proteins in the signal transduction pathways (e.g., Ras). Mg2+ ions accelerate the protein farnesylation reaction by up to 700-fold. The exact function of Mg2+ in catalysis and the structural characteristics of its binding remain unresolved to date. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations addressing the role of magnesium ions in FTase are presented, and relevant octahedral binding motifs for Mg2+ in wild-type (WT) FTase and the Dβ352A mutant are explored. Our simulations suggest that the addition of Mg2+ ions causes a conformational change to occur in the FTase active site, breaking interactions known to keep FPP in its inactive conformation. Two relevant Mg2+ ion binding motifs were determined in WT FTase. In the first binding motif, WT1, the Mg2+ ion is coordinated to D352β, zinc-bound D297β, two water molecules, and one oxygen atom from the α- and β-phosphates of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). The second binding motif, WT2, is identical with the exception of the zinc-bound D297β being replaced by a water molecule in the Mg2+ coordination complex. In the Dβ352A mutant Mg2+ binding motif, D297β, three water molecules, and one oxygen atom from the α- and β-phosphates of FPP complete the octahedral coordination sphere of Mg2+. Simulations of WT FTase, in which Mg2+ was replaced by water in the active site, recreated the salt bridges and hydrogen-bonding patterns around FPP, validating these simulations. In all Mg2+ binding motifs, a key hydrogen bond was identified between a magnesium-bound water and Cys1p, bridging the two metallic binding sites and, thereby, reducing the equilibrium distance between the reacting atoms of FPP Cys1p. The free energy profiles calculated for these systems provide a qualitative understanding of experimental results. They demonstrate that the two reactive atoms approach each other more readily in the presence of Mg2+ in WT FTase and mutant. The flexible WT2 model was found to possess the lowest barrier toward the conformational change, suggesting it is the preferred Mg2+ binding motif in WT FTase. In the mutant, the absence of D352β makes the transition toward a conformational change harder. Our calculations find support for the proposal that D352β performs a critical role in Mg2+ binding and Mg2+ plays an important role in the conformational transition step.",

        "abstract": "In aerobic bioprocesses, oxygen is a key substrate; due to its low solubility in broths (aqueous solutions), a continuous supply is needed. The oxygen transfer rate (OTR) must be known, and if possible predicted to achieve an optimum design operation and scale-up of bioreactors. Many studies have been conducted to enhance the efficiency of oxygen transfer. The dissolved oxygen concentration in a suspension of aerobic microorganisms depends on the rate of oxygen transfer from the gas phase to the liquid, on the rate at which oxygen is transported into the cells (where it is consumed), and on the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) by the microorganism for growth, maintenance and production. The gas-liquid mass transfer in a bioprocess is strongly influenced by the hydrodynamic conditions in the bioreactors. These conditions are known to be a function of energy dissipation that depends on the operational conditions, the physicochemical properties of the culture, the geometrical parameters of the bioreactor and also on the presence of oxygen consuming cells. Stirred tank and bubble column (of various types) bioreactors are widely used in a large variety of bioprocesses (such as aerobic fermentation and biological wastewater treatments, among others). Stirred tanks bioreactors provide high values of mass and heat transfer rates and excellent mixing. In these systems, a high number of variables affect the mass transfer and mixing, but the most important among them are stirrer speed, type and number of stirrers and gas flow rate used. In bubble columns and airlifts, the low-shear environment compared to the stirred tanks has enabled successful cultivation of shear sensitive and filamentous cells. Oxygen transfer is often the rate-limiting step in the aerobic bioprocess due to the low solubility of oxygen in the medium. The correct measurement and/or prediction of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient, (k(L)a), is a crucial step in the design, operation and scale-up of bioreactors. The present work is aimed at the reviewing of the oxygen transfer rate (OTR) in bioprocesses to provide a better knowledge about the selection, design, scale-up and development of bioreactors. First, the most used measuring methods are revised; then the main empirical equations, including those using dimensionless numbers, are considered. The possible increasing on OTR due to the oxygen consumption by the cells is taken into account through the use of the biological enhancement factor. Theoretical predictions of both the volumetric mass transfer coefficient and the enhancement factor that have been recently proposed are described; finally, different criteria for bioreactor scale-up are considered in the light of the influence of OTR and OUR affecting the dissolved oxygen concentration in real bioprocess.",

Among these techniques, high-throughput molecular docking has proved to be extremely useful in identifying novel bioactive compounds within large chemical libraries. In the docking procedure, the predominant binding mode of each small molecule within a target binding site is assessed, and a docking score reflective of the likelihood of binding is assigned to them. These methods also shed light on how a given hit could be modified in order to improve protein-ligand interactions and are thus able to guide lead optimization. The possibility of reducing time and cost compared to experimental approaches made this technology highly appealing. Due to methodological developments and the increase of computational power, the application of quantum mechanical methods to study macromolecular systems has gained substantial attention in the last decade. A quantum mechanical description of the interactions involved in molecular association of biomolecules may lead to better accuracy compared to molecular mechanics, since there are many physical phenomena that cannot be correctly described within a classical framework, such as covalent bond formation, polarization effects, charge transfer, bond rearrangements, halogen bonding, and others, that require electrons to be explicitly accounted for.

        "abstract": "A powerful tool to study the mechanism of reactions in solutions or enzymes is to perform the ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, the computational cost is too high due to the explicit electronic structure calculations at every time step of the simulation. A neural network (NN) method can accelerate the QM/MM-MD simulations, but it has long been a problem to accurately describe the QM/MM electrostatic coupling by NN in the electrostatic embedding (EE) scheme. In this work, we developed a new method to accelerate QM/MM calculations in the mechanic embedding (ME) scheme. The potentials and partial point charges of QM atoms are first learned in vacuo by the embedded atom neural networks (EANN) approach. MD simulations are then performed on this EANN/MM potential energy surface (PES) to obtain free energy (FE) profiles for reactions, in which the QM/MM electrostatic coupling is treated in the mechanic embedding (ME) scheme. Finally, a weighted thermodynamic perturbation (wTP) corrects the FE profiles in the ME scheme to the EE scheme. For two reactions in water and one in methanol, our simulations reproduced the B3LYP/MM free energy profiles within 0.5 kcal/mol with a speed-up of 30-60-fold. The results show that the strategy of combining EANN potential in the ME scheme with the wTP correction is efficient and reliable for chemical reaction simulations in liquid. Another advantage of our method is that the QM PES is independent of the MM subsystem, so it can be applied to various MM environments as demonstrated by an SN2 reaction studied in water and methanol individually, which used the same EANN PES. The free energy profiles are in excellent accordance with the results obtained from B3LYP/MM-MD simulations. In future, this method will be applied to the reactions of enzymes and their variants.",

        "abstract": "An accurate scoring function is expected to correctly select the most stable structure from a set of pose candidates. One can hypothesize that a scoring function's ability to identify the most stable structure might be improved by emphasizing the most relevant atom pairwise interactions. However, it is hard to evaluate the relevant importance for each atom pair using traditional means. With the introduction of machine learning (ML) methods, it has become possible to determine the relative importance for each atom pair present in a scoring function. In this work, we use the Random Forest (RF) method to refine a pair potential developed by our laboratory (GARF; Zhang , Z. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2018 , 14 , 5045 ) by identifying relevant atom pairs that optimize the performance of the potential on our given task. Our goal is to construct a ML model that can accurately differentiate the native ligand binding pose from candidate poses using a potential refined by RF optimization. We successfully constructed RF models on an unbalanced data set with the \"comparison\" concept, and the resultant RF models were tested on CASF-2013 ( Li , Y. J. Chem. Inf.Model. 2014 , 54 , 1700 ). In a comparison of the performance of our RF models against 29 scoring functions, we found that our models outperformed the other scoring functions in predicting the native pose. In addition, we created two artificially designed potential function sets to address the importance of the GARF potential in the RF models: (1) a scrambled probability function set, which was obtained by mixing up atom pairs and probability functions in GARF, and (2) a uniform probability function set, which shares the same peak positions with GARF but has fixed peak heights. The results of accuracy comparison from RF models based on the scrambled, uniform, and original GARF potential clearly showed that the peak positions in the GARF potential are important while the well depths are not.

Here we introduce a modular synthon-based approach-V-SYNTHES-to perform hierarchical structure-based screening of a REAL Space library of more than 11 billion compounds. V-SYNTHES first identifies the best scaffold-synthon combinations as seeds suitable for further growth, and then iteratively elaborates these seeds to select complete molecules with the best docking scores. This hierarchical combinatorial approach enables the rapid detection of the best-scoring compounds in the gigascale chemical space while performing docking of only a small fraction (<0.1%) of the library compounds. Chemical synthesis and experimental testing of novel cannabinoid antagonists predicted by V-SYNTHES demonstrated a 33% hit rate, including 14 submicromolar ligands, substantially improving over a standard virtual screening of the Enamine REAL diversity subset, which required approximately 100 times more computational resources. Synthesis of selected analogues of the best hits further improved potencies and affinities (best inhibitory constant (Ki) = 0.9 nM) and CB2/CB1 selectivity (50-200-fold).

The new Poisson-Boltzmann equation together with new boundary conditions results in a new set of equations for the electrostatic potential (or polarization charge densities). Charge transfer adds a new free energy component to the solvation free energy term, which accounts for all interactions between the transferred charge at the dielectric interface, the solute wave function and the solvent polarization charges. Practical calculations on a set of 19 anions and 17 cations demonstrate that charge exchange with a dielectric is present and it is in the range of 0.06-0.4 eu.

We have carried out simulations on three models in an attempt to shed light on why the spectroscopic and X-ray results differ. The first model we studied (Model I) has cyanide directly coordinated to the zinc ion, the second has it noncovalently interacting with the zinc-hydroxide (high pH) form of the enzyme (Model II), and the third has cyanide noncovalently interacting with the zinc-water (low pH) form of the enzyme (Model III). None of these models is satisfactory in explaining the available structural data obtained from X-ray crystallography. This leads us to propose an alternative model, in which HCAII hydrates HCN to form an OH-/HCN complex coordinated to the Zn ion. Ab initio calculations are consistent with this model.

Fundamental insights into how dynamics affects reactivity and product distributions will facilitate the design of novel catalysts that can produce high quality compounds that can be employed, for example, as fuels and life saving drugs. We have used molecular dynamics (MD) methods and combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods to study a series of proteins either whose substrates are too far away from the catalytic center or whose experimentally resolved substrate binding modes cannot explain the observed product distribution. In particular, we describe studies of farnesyl transferase (FTase) where the farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) substrate is ∼8 Å from the zinc-bound peptide in the active site of FTase. Using MD and QM/MM studies, we explain how the FPP substrate spans the gulf between it and the active site, and we have elucidated the nature of the transition state (TS) and offered an alternate explanation of experimentally observed kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). Our second story focuses on the nature of substrate dynamics in the aromatic prenyltransferase (APTase) protein NphB and how substrate dynamics affects the observed product distribution. Through the examples chosen we show the power of MD and QM/MM methods to provide unique insights into how protein substrate dynamics affects catalytic efficiency. We also illustrate how complex these reactions are and highlight the challenges faced when attempting to design de novo catalysts. While the methods used in our previous studies provided useful insights, several clear challenges still remain. In particular, we have utilized a semiempirical QM model (self-consistent charge density functional tight binding, SCC-DFTB) in our QM/MM studies since the problems we were addressing required extensive sampling. For the problems illustrated, this approach performed admirably (we estimate for these systems an uncertainty of ∼2 kcal/mol), but it is still a semiempirical model, and studies of this type would benefit greatly from more accurate ab initio or DFT models. However, the challenge with these methods is to reach the level of sampling needed to study systems where large conformational changes happen in the many nanoseconds to microsecond time regimes. Hence, how to couple expensive and accurate QM methods with sophisticated sampling algorithms is an important future challenge especially when large-scale studies of catalyst design become of interest. The use of MD and QM/MM models to elucidate enzyme catalytic pathways and to design novel catalytic agents is in its infancy but shows tremendous promise. While this Account summarizes where we have been, we also discuss briefly future directions that improve our fundamental ability to understand enzyme catalysis.",

Herein this PCET reaction is studied with mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) free energy simulations. The free energy surfaces are computed as functions of the proton donor-acceptor (C-O) distance and the proton coordinate, and the potential of mean force is computed as a function of the C-O distance, inherently including anharmonicity. The simulation results are used to calculate the kinetic isotope effects for the wild-type enzyme (WT) and the L546A/L754A double mutant (DM), which have been measured experimentally to be ∼80 and ∼700, respectively. The PCET reaction is found to be exoergic for WT and slightly endoergic for the DM, and the equilibrium C-O distance for the reactant is found to be ∼0.2 Å greater for the DM than for WT. The larger equilibrium distance for the DM, which is due mainly to less optimal substrate binding in the expanded binding cavity, is primarily responsible for its higher kinetic isotope effect. The calculated potentials of mean force are anharmonic and relatively soft at shorter C-O distances, allowing efficient thermal sampling of the shorter distances required for effective hydrogen tunneling. The primarily local electrostatic field at the transferring hydrogen is ∼100 MV/cm in the direction to facilitate proton transfer and increases dramatically as the C-O distance decreases. These simulations suggest that the overall protein environment is important for conformational sampling of active substrate configurations aligned for proton transfer, but the PCET reaction is influenced primarily by local electrostatic effects that facilitate conformational sampling of shorter proton donor-acceptor distances required for effective hydrogen tunneling.",

        "abstract": "The halogen bond (or X-bond) is a noncovalent interaction that is increasingly recognized as an important design tool for engineering protein-ligand interactions and controlling the structures of proteins and nucleic acids. In the past decade, there have been significant efforts to characterize the structure-energy relationships of this interaction in macromolecules. Progress in the computational modeling of X-bonds in biological molecules, however, has lagged behind these experimental studies, with most molecular mechanics/dynamics-based simulation methods not properly treating the properties of the X-bond. We had previously derived a force field for biological X-bonds (ffBXB) based on a set of potential energy functions that describe the anisotropic electrostatic and shape properties of halogens participating in X-bonds. Although fairly accurate for reproducing the energies within biomolecular systems, including X-bonds engineered into a DNA junction, the ffBXB with its seven variable parameters was considered to be too unwieldy for general applications. In the current study, we have generalized the ffBXB by reducing the number of variables to just one for each halogen type and show that this remaining electrostatic variable can be estimated for any new halogenated molecule through a standard restricted electrostatic potential calculation of atomic charges. In addition, we have generalized the ffBXB for both nucleic acids and proteins. As a proof of principle, we have parameterized this reduced and more general ffBXB against the AMBER force field. The resulting parameter set was shown to accurately recapitulate the quantum mechanical landscape and experimental interaction energies of X-bonds incorporated into DNA junction and T4 lysozyme model systems. Thus, this reduced and generalized ffBXB is more readily adaptable for incorporation into classical molecular mechanics/dynamics algorithms, including those commonly used to design inhibitors against therapeutic targets in medicinal chemistry and materials in biomolecular engineering.",

        "abstract": "Enzymatic reactions are integral components in many biological functions and malfunctions. The iconic structure of each reaction path for elucidating the reaction mechanism in details is the molecular structure of the rate-limiting transition state (RLTS). But RLTS is very hard to get caught or to get visualized by experimentalists. In spite of the lack of explicit molecular structure of the RLTS in experiment, we still can trace out the RLTS unique \"fingerprints\" by measuring the isotope effects on the reaction rate. This set of \"fingerprints\" is considered as a most direct probe of RLTS. By contrast, for computer simulations, oftentimes molecular structures of a number of TS can be precisely visualized on computer screen, however, theoreticians are not sure which TS is the actual rate-limiting one. As a result, this is an excellent stage setting for a perfect \"marriage\" between experiment and theory for determining the structure of RLTS, along with the reaction mechanism, i.e., experimentalists are responsible for \"fingerprinting\", whereas theoreticians are responsible for providing candidates that match the \"fingerprints\". In this Review, the origin of isotope effects on a chemical reaction is discussed from the perspectives of classical and quantum worlds, respectively (e.g., the origins of the inverse kinetic isotope effects and all the equilibrium isotope effects are purely from quantum). The conventional Bigeleisen equation for isotope effect calculations, as well as its refined version in the framework of Feynman's path integral and Kleinert's variational perturbation (KP) theory for systematically incorporating anharmonicity and (non-parabolic) quantum tunneling, are also presented. In addition, the outstanding interplay between theory and experiment for successfully deducing the RLTS structures and the reaction mechanisms is demonstrated by applications on biochemical reactions, namely models of bacterial squalene-to-hopene polycyclization and RNA 2'-O-transphosphorylation. For all these applications, we used our recently-developed path-integral method based on the KP theory, called automated integration-free path-integral (AIF-PI) method, to perform ab initio path-integral calculations of isotope effects. As opposed to the conventional path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) and Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations, values calculated from our AIF-PI path-integral method can be as precise as (not as accurate as) the numerical precision of the computing machine. Lastly, comments are made on the general challenges in theoretical modeling of candidates matching the experimental \"fingerprints\" of RLTS.

        "title": "Consequences of Overfitting the van der Waals Radii of Ions",
        "abstract": "dii play important roles in scientific research. The covalent radii of atoms, ionic radii of ions, and van der Waals (VDW) radii of neutral atoms can all be derived from crystal structures. However, the VDW radii of ions are a challenge to determine because the atomic distances in crystal structures were determined by a combination of VDW interactions and electrostatic interactions, making it unclear how to define the VDW sphere of ions in such an environment. In the present study, we found that VDW radii, which were determined based on the 0.0015 au electron density contour through a wavefunction analysis on atoms, have excellent agreement with the VDW radii of noble-gas atoms determined experimentally. Based on this criterion, we calculated the VDW radii for various atomic ions across the periodic table, providing a systematic set of VDW radii of ions. Previously we have shown that the 12-6 Lennard-Jones nonbonded model could not simultaneously reproduce the hydration free energy (HFE) and ion-oxygen distance (IOD) for an atomic ion when its charge is +2 or higher. Because of this, we developed the 12-6-4 model to reproduce both properties at the same time by explicitly considering the ion-induced dipole interactions. However, recent studies showed it was possible to use the 12-6 model to simulate both properties simultaneously when an ion has the Rmin/2 parameter (i.e., the VDW radius) close to the Shannon ionic radius. In the present study, we show that such a \"success\" is due to an unphysical overfitting, as the VDW radius of an ion should be significantly larger than its ionic radius. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we show that such overfitting causes significant issues when transferring the parameters from ion-water systems to ion-ligand and metalloprotein systems. In comparison, the 12-6-4 model shows significant improvement in comparison to the overfitted 12-6 model, showing excellent transferability across different systems. In summary, although both the 12-6-4 and 12-6 models could reproduce HFE and IOD for an ion, the 12-6-4 model accomplishes such a task based on the consideration of the physics involved, while the 12-6 model accomplishes this through overfitting, which brings significant transferability issues when simulating other systems. Hence, we strongly recommend the use of the 12-6-4 model (or even more sophisticated models) instead of overfitted 12-6 models when simulating complex systems such as metalloproteins.",

        "abstract": "Modeling the interaction between a metal ion and small molecules can provide pivotal information to bridge and close the gap between two types of simulations: metal ions in water and metal ions in metalloproteins. As previously established, the 12-6-4 Lennard-Jones (LJ)-type nonbonded model, because of its ability to account for the induced dipole effect, has been highly successful in simulating metal ion systems. Using the potential of mean force (PMF) method, the polarizability of the metal-chelating nitrogen from two types of imidazole molecules, delta nitrogen protonated (HID) and epsilon nitrogen protonated (HIE), has been parametrized against experiment for 11 metals (Ag(I), Ca(II), Cd(II), Co(II), Cu(I), Cu(II), Fe(II), Mg(II), Mn(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II)) in conjunction with three commonly used water models (TIP3P, SPC/E, and OPC). We show that the standard 12-6 and unmodified 12-6-4 models are not able to accurately model these interactions and, indeed, predict that the complex should be unstable. The resultant parameters further establish the flexibility and the reliability of the 12-6-4 LJ-type nonbonded model, which can correctly describe three-component interactions between a metal, ligand, and solvent by simply tuning the polarizability of the chelating atom. Also, the transferability of this model was tested, showing the capability of describing metal-ligand interactions in various environments.",

Among them, the Zrt/Irt-like protein (ZIP) regulates the influx of zinc into the cytoplasm. In this work, we have employed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the Zn2+ transport mechanism in prokaryotic ZIP obtained from Bordetella bronchiseptica (BbZIP) in a membrane bilayer. Additionally, the structural and dynamical transformations of BbZIP during this process have been analyzed. This study allowed us to develop a hypothesis for the zinc influx mechanism and formation of the metal-binding site. We have created a model for the outward-facing form of BbZIP (experimentally only the inward-facing form has been characterized) that has allowed us, for the first time, to observe the Zn2+ ion entering the channel and binding to the negatively charged M2 site. It is thought that the M2 site is less favored than the M1 site, which then leads to metal ion egress; however, we have not observed the M1 site being occupied in our simulations. Furthermore, removing both Zn2+ ions from this complex resulted in the collapse of the metal-binding site, illustrating the \"structural role\" of metal ions in maintaining the binding site and holding the proteins together. Finally, due to the long Cd2+-residue bond distances observed in the X-ray structures, we have proposed the existence of an H3O+ ion at the M2 site that plays an important role in protein stability in the absence of the metal ion.",

The N-terminal region of the membrane fusion protein CusB (CusB-NT) is highly disordered, and hence, experimentally characterizing its structure is challenging. In a previous study, this disorder was confirmed with molecular dynamics simulations, although some key structural elements were determined. It was experimentally shown that CusB-NT is fully functional in transferring the metal from the metallochaperone CusF. In this study, we docked these two entities together and formed two representative metal coordination modes, which consist of residues from both proteins. In this way, we created two potential CusB-NT/CusF complexes that share coordination of Cu(I) and thereby represent structural models for the metal transfer process. Each model complex was simulated for 4 μs. The previously observed structural disorder in CusB-NT disappeared upon complexation with CusF. The only differences between the two models occurred in the M21-M36 loop region of CusB-NT and the open flap of CusF: we observed the model with two CusB-NT methionine residues and a CusF methionine as the metal coordination site (termed \"MMM\") to be more stable than the model with a CusB-NT methionine, a CusF methionine, and a CusF histidine ligating the metal (termed \"MMH\"). The observed stability of the MMM model was probed for an additional 2 μs, yielding a total simulation time of 6 μs. We hypothesize that both MMM and MMH configurations might take part in the metal exchange process in which the MMH configuration would appear first and would be followed by the MMM configuration. Given the experimental finding of comparable binding affinities of CusB-NT and CusF, the increased stability of the MMM configuration might be a determinant for the transfer from CusF to CusB-NT. The metal would be transferred from the more CusF-dominated metal binding environment (MMH model) to a more CusB-dominated one (MMM model) in which the coordination environment is more stable. From the MMM model, the metal ion would ultimately be coordinated by the CusB methionines only, which would complete the Cu(I) transfer process.",

CloQ is a Mg(2+)-independent aromatic prenyltransferase (APTase) that transfers a dimethylallyl group to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate in the biosynthetic pathway for clorobiocin. APTases consist of a common ABBA fold that defines a β-barrel containing the reaction cavity. Positively charged basic residues line the inside of the β-barrel of CloQ to activate the pyrophosphate leaving group to replace the function of the Mg(2+) cofactor in other APTases. Classical molecular dynamics simulations of CloQ, its E281G and F68S mutants, and the related NovQ were used to explore the binding of the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (4HPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate substrates in the reactive cavity and the role of various conserved residues. Hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics potential of mean force (PMF) calculations show that the effect of the replacement of the Mg(2+) cofactor with basic residues yields a similar activation barrier for prenylation to Mg(2+)-dependent APTases like NphB. The topology of the binding pocket for 4HPP is important for selective prenylation at the ortho position of the ring. Methylation at this position alters the conformation of the substrate for O-prenylation at the phenol group. Further, a two-dimensional PMF scan shows that a \"reverse\" prenylation product may be a possible target for protein engineering.",

The variational method eliminates the bias of the earlier method used to distribute CT charge into the dielectric, i.e., the need to specify the solute atoms used in constructing the BE grid. The surface pattern of the magnitudes of the CT charges placed onto the BE grid is obtained by minimizing an energy functional defined as the sum of the CT charge self-interaction energy and the energies due to CT charge interaction with the reaction field (RF) and solute partial atomic charges.

These potentials have been developed within the context of the two-particle Kirkwood equation by extending its original use for isotropic monatomic systems to anisotropic biomolecular systems. However, the accuracy and the unclear physical meaning of statistical potentials have long formed the central arguments against such methods. In this work, we present a new approach to generate molecular energy functions using structural data mining. Instead of employing the Kirkwood equation and introducing the \"reference state\" approximation, we model the multidimensional probability distributions of the molecular system using graphical models and generate the target pairwise Boltzmann probabilities using the Bayesian field theory. Different from the current statistical potentials that mimic the \"knowledge-based\" PMF based on the 2-particle Kirkwood equation, the graphical-model-based structure-derived potential developed in this study focuses on the generation of lower-dimensional Boltzmann distributions of atoms through reduction of dimensionality.

The enzyme was solvated by 25321 water molecules, and additionally, 4788 urea molecules were added to the solution. Although concentrated urea solutions are known laboratory denaturants, the protein secondary structure is retained throughout the simulation largely because of the short simulation time (urea denaturation occurs on the millisecond time scale). The relatively constant solvent accessible surface area over the last 400 ns of the simulation further confirms the overall lack of denaturation. The wide-open flap state observed previously in Klebsiella areogenes urease [Roberts, B. P., et al. (2012) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 134, 9934] and H. pylori [Minkara, M. S., et al. (2014) J. Chem.

Furthermore, urea molecules were observed to approach the pentacoordinate Ni(2+) ion in position to bind in a manner consistent with the proposed initial coordination step of the hydrolysis mechanism. We also observed a specific and unique pattern in the regions of the protein with a high root-mean-square fluctuation (rmsf). The high-rmsf regions in the β-chain form a horseshoelike arrangement surrounding the active site-covering flap on the surface of the protein.

With recent advances in linear scaling quantum mechanics there are now new tools available to enhance our understanding of the electronic properties of DNA among other biomolecules. Using both explicit solvent models and implicit (continuum) solvent models, the electronic characteristics of a dodecamer duplex DNA have been fully studied using both divide and conquer (D&C), semi-empirical quantum mechanics and non-D&C semi-empirical quantum mechanics. According to the AM1 Hamiltonian, approximately 3.5 electrons (approximately 0.3 electron/base pair) are transferred from the duplex to the solvent. According to the density of state (DOS) analysis, in vacuo DNA has a band gap of approximately 1 eV showing that in the absence of solvent, the DNA may exhibit similar properties to those of a semiconductor. Upon increasing solvation (2.5-5.5 A), the band gap ranges from approximately 3 eV to approximately 6 eV. For the implicit solvent model, the band gap continues this widening trend to approximately 7 eV. Therefore, upon solvation and in the absence of dopants, the DNA should begin to loose its conductive properties. Finally, when one considers the energy and localization of the frontier orbitals (HOMO and LUMO), solvent has a stabilizing effect on the DNA system. The energy of the HOMO drops from approximately 15 eV in vacuo to approximately 2 eV for 5.5 A of water to approximately -8 eV for the implicit solvent model. Similarly, the LUMO drops from approximately 16 eV for in vacuo to approximately 9 eV for 5.5 A of water to approximately -1 eV for the implicit model. Beyond the importance of the computed results on the materials properties of DNA, the present work also shows that the behavior of intercalators will be affected by the electronic properties of DNA. This could have an impact on our understanding of how DNA based drugs interact with DNA and on the design of new DNA based small molecule drugs.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge-based potentials generally perform better than physics-based scoring functions in detecting the native structure from a collection of decoy protein structures. Through the use of a reference state, the pure interactions between atom/residue pairs can be obtained through the removal of contributions from ideal-gas state potentials. However, it is a challenge for conventional knowledge-based potentials to assign different importance factors to different atom/residue pairs. In this work, via the use of the \"comparison\" concept, Random Forest (RF) models were successfully generated using unbalanced data sets that assign different importance factors to atom pair potentials to enhance their ability to identify native proteins from decoy proteins. Individual and combined data sets consisting of 12 decoy sets were used to test the performance of the RF models. We find that RF models increase the recognition of native structures without affecting their ability to identify the best decoy structures. We also created models using scrambled atom types, which create physically unrealistic probability functions in order to test the ability of the RF algorithm to create useful models based on inputted scrambled probability functions. From this test, we find that we are unable to create models that are of similar quality relative to the unscrambled probability functions. Next, we created uniform probability functions where the peak positions are the same as the original, but each interaction has the same peak height. Using these uniform potentials, we were able to recover models as good as the ones using the full potentials suggesting all that is important in these models are the experimental peak positions. The KECSA2 potential along with all codes used in this work are available at https://github.com/JunPei000/protein_folding-decoy-set .",

Many approaches have been put forward to address receptor flexibility in docking studies by generating relevant ensembles on the energy surface. Herein, we describe the Movable Type with flexibility (MTflex) method that generates ensembles on the more relevant free energy surface in a computationally tractable manner. This novel approach enumerates conformational states based on side chain flexibility and then estimates their relative free energies using the MT methodology. The resultant conformational states can then be used in subsequent docking and scoring exercises. In particular, we demonstrate that using the MTflex ensembles improves MT's ability to predict binding free energies over docking only to the crystal structure.",

The methodology adopted here is formally the same as that of the previously published finite perturbation theory GIAO-MNDO-NMR approach [Wang, B.; et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2004, 120, 24.]. The primary impetus for this parametrization was the accurate capture of chemical environments of atoms in biological systems. Protein-specific parameters were developed on a training set that comprised five globular protein systems with varied secondary structure and a range in size from 46-61 amino acid residues. A separate set of parameters was developed using a training set of small organic compounds with an emphasis on functional groups that are relevant to biological studies. Our approach can be employed using semiempirical (AM1) geometries and can be executed at a fraction of the cost of ab initio and DFT methods, thus providing an attractive option for the computational NMR studies of much larger protein systems. Analysis carried out on 3340 (1)H and 2233 (13)C chemical shifts for protein systems shows significant improvement over the standard AM1 parameters. Using (1)H and (13)C specific parameters, the rms errors are from 1.05 and 21.28 ppm to 0.62 and 4.83 ppm for hydrogen and carbon, respectively.",

        "abstract": "In general perturbation methods starts with a known exact solution of a problem and add \"small\" variation terms in order to approach to a solution for a related problem without known exact solution. Perturbation theory has been widely used in almost all areas of science. Bhor's quantum model, Heisenberg's matrix mechanincs, Feyman diagrams, and Poincare's chaos model or \"butterfly effect\" in complex systems are examples of perturbation theories. On the other hand, the study of Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships (QSPR) in molecular complex systems is an ideal area for the application of perturbation theory. There are several problems with exact experimental solutions (new chemical reactions, physicochemical properties, drug activity and distribution, metabolic networks, etc.) in public databases like CHEMBL. However, in all these cases, we have an even larger list of related problems without known solutions. We need to know the change in all these properties after a perturbation of initial boundary conditions. It means, when we test large sets of similar, but different, compounds and/or chemical reactions under the slightly different conditions (temperature, time, solvents, enzymes, assays, protein targets, tissues, partition systems, organisms, etc.). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no QSPR general-purpose perturbation theory to solve this problem. In this work, firstly we review general aspects and applications of both perturbation theory and QSPR models. Secondly, we formulate a general-purpose perturbation theory for multiple-boundary QSPR problems. Last, we develop three new QSPR-Perturbation theory models. The first model classify correctly >100,000 pairs of intra-molecular carbolithiations with 75-95% of Accuracy (Ac), Sensitivity (Sn), and Specificity (Sp). The model predicts probabilities of variations in the yield and enantiomeric excess of reactions due to at least one perturbation in boundary conditions (solvent, temperature, temperature of addition, or time of reaction). The model also account for changes in chemical structure (connectivity structure and/or chirality paterns in substrate, product, electrophile agent, organolithium, and ligand of the asymmetric catalyst). The second model classifies more than 150,000 cases with 85-100% of Ac, Sn, and Sp. The data contains experimental shifts in up to 18 different pharmacological parameters determined in >3000 assays of ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination, and Toxicity) properties and/or interactions between 31723 drugs and 100 targets (metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, or organisms). The third model classifies more than 260,000 cases of perturbations in the self-aggregation of drugs and surfactants to form micelles with Ac, Sn, and Sp of 94-95%. The model predicts changes in 8 physicochemical and/or thermodynamics output parameters (critic micelle concentration, aggregation number, degree of ionization, surface area, enthalpy, free energy, entropy, heat capacity) of self-aggregation due to perturbations. The perturbations refers to changes in initial temperature, solvent, salt, salt concentration, solvent, and/or structure of the anion or cation of more than 150 different drugs and surfactants. QSPR-Perturbation Theory models may be useful for multi-objective optimization of organic synthesis, physicochemical properties, biological activity, metabolism, and distribution profiles towards the design of new drugs, surfactants, asymmetric ligands for catalysts, and other materials.",

The paradigm, zinc-sensing transcriptional repressor Staphylococcus aureus CzrA represents an excellent model system to understand how metal sensor proteins maintain cellular metal homeostasis. Here, we discuss studies that helped to characterize a metal ion-mediated hydrogen-bonding pathway (HBP) that plays a dominant role in the allosteric mechanism of DNA operator binding in these proteins. The chapter discusses computational methods used to provide a molecular basis for the large conformational motions and allosteric coupling free energy (~6kcal/mol) associated with Zn(II) binding in CzrA. We present an accurate and convenient means by which to include metal ions in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure determination process using molecular dynamics (MD) constrained by NMR-derived data. The method provides a realistic and physically viable description of the metal-binding site(s) and has potentially broad applicability in the structure determination of metal ion-bound proteins, protein folding, and metal template protein-design studies. Finally, our simulations provide strong support for a proposed HBP that physically connects the metal-binding residue, His97, to the DNA-binding interface through the αR helix that is present only in the Zn(II)-bound state. We find the interprotomer hydrogen bond interaction to be significantly stronger (~8kcal/mol) at functional allosteric metal-binding sites compared to the apo proteins. This interaction works to overcome the considerable disorder at these hydrogen-bonding sites in apo protein and functions as a \"switch\" to lock in a weak DNA-binding conformation once metal is bound. This interaction is found to be considerably weaker in nonresponsive metal-binding sites. These findings suggest a conserved functional role of metal-mediated second-shell coordination hydrogen bonds at allosterically responsive sites in zinc-sensing transcription regulators.",

Their applications cover a wide range of fields, either as metallodrugs in medicine or as materials, catalysts, batteries, solar cells, etc. The demand for the novel design of transition metal complexes with new properties remains of great interest. However, the traditional high-throughput screening approach is inherently expensive and laborious since it depends on human expertise. Here, we present LigandDiff, a generative model for the de novo design of novel transition metal complexes. Unlike the existing methods that simply extract and combine ligands with the metal to get new complexes, LigandDiff aims at designing configurationally novel ligands from scratch, which opens new pathways for the discovery of organometallic complexes. Moreover, it overcomes the limitations of current methods, where the diversity of new complexes highly relies on the diversity of available ligands, while LigandDiff can design numerous novel ligands without human intervention. Our results indicate that LigandDiff designs unique and novel ligands under different contexts, and these generated ligands are synthetically accessible. Moreover, LigandDiff shows good transferability by generating successful ligands for any transition metal complex.",

Polarization effects are introduced by the electronegativity equalization model (EEM) method where charges on the metal ion and its dummy atoms can fluctuate to respond to the environment. This model includes explicit polarization and ion-induced interactions and can be coupled with nonpolarizable or polarizable water models, making it more transferable to simpler force fields. This approach allows us to enhance the original fixed charge CDA model where the charge distribution cannot adapt to the local solvent structure. To illustrate the new CDApol model, we examined properties of the Zn2+, Al3+, and Zr4+ ions in aqueous solution. The polarizable model and Lennard-Jones parameters were refined for octahedrally coordinated Zn2+, Al3+, and Zr4+ CDAs to reproduce thermodynamic and geometrical properties. Using this locally polarizable model, we were able to obtain the experimental hydration free energy, ion-oxygen distance, and coordination number coupled with the standard 12-6 Lennard-Jones model. This model can be used in myriad additional applications where local polarization and charge transfer is important.",

Diffusive properties of many liquids including water have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically, while for transition metal ions, there exist significant experimental data that have not been extensively studied theoretically. Hence, high-confidence predictions for challenging systems like radioactive ions that are biohazardous cannot be reliably generated. In this work, a workflow named ISAIAH (Ion Simulation using AMBER for dIffusion Action when Hydrated) was designed to accurately simulate the diffusion coefficients of 15 monoatomic ions with charges varying from -1 to +3 in four water models. As the results indicate, good agreement with experimental values was achieved, leading us to select 239Pu4+ (for which no experimental data are available) as a candidate ion to make a theoretical prediction of its diffusion coefficient in water. Among all the force field parameter sets, the ones parametrized using an augmented 12-6-4 Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential showed lower average unsigned errors (AUE) for ions of various radii and electron configurations relative to some 12-6 LJ parameters. This observation agrees well with the fact that diffusion is affected by both the hydration free energy (HFE) and the ion-oxygen distance (IOD) between solute and solvent molecules, both of which are handled well by the 12-6-4 model.",

In this previous work, we described, on the basis of density-functional calculations, proton transport in the classical and semi-classical regimes, and provided arguments in favor of an adiabatic picture for proton transfer at low temperature. We re-explain here our article (with more detail and precision), the content of which has been distorted in the Comment, and reiterate our arguments in this reply. We refute all criticisms. They are completely wrong in the context of our article. Even though a few of them are based on considerations probably true in some metals, they make no sense here since they do not correspond to the content of our work. It has not been understood in the Comment that two competitive configurations, associated with radically different transfer mechanisms, have been studied in our work. It has also not been understood in the Comment that the adiabatic regime described for transfer occurs in the protonic ground state, in a very-low barrier configuration with the protonic ground state energy larger than the barrier. Serious confusion has been made in the Comment with the case of H in metals like Nb or Ta, leading to the introduction of the notion of (protonic) \"excited-state proton transfer\", relevant for H in some metals, but (i) that does not correspond to the (ground state) adiabatic transfers here described, and (ii) that does not correspond to what is commonly described as the \"adiabatic limit for proton transfer\" in the scientific literature. We emphasize, accordingly, the large differences between proton transfer in the present oxide and hydrogen jumps in metals like Nb or Ta, and the similarities between proton transfer in the present oxide and in acid-base solutions. We finally describe a scenario for proton transfer in the present oxide regardless of the temperature regime.",

From detailed potential of mean force (PMF) and two-dimensional PMF analyses, we conclude that the rate-limiting step is the cleavage of the C–O bond in DMAPP, while the deprotonation/cyclization step determines the final product distribution.

They not only act as catalysts to facilitate biological processes but are also important as protein structural elements. Accurately predicting metal ion interactions in computational studies has always been a challenge, and various methods have been suggested to improve these interactions. One such method is the 12-6-4 Lennard-Jones (LJ)-type nonbonded model. Using this model, it has been possible to successfully reproduce the experimental properties of metal ions in aqueous solution. The model includes induced dipole interactions typically ignored in the standard 12-6 LJ nonbonded model. In this we expand the applicability of this model to metal ion-carboxylate interactions. Using 12-6-4 parameters that reproduce the solvation free energies of the metal ions leads to an overestimation of metal ion-acetate interactions, thus, prompting us to fine-tune the model to specifically handle the latter. We also show that the standard 12-6 LJ model significantly falls short in reproducing the experimental binding free energy between acetate and 11 metal ions (Ni(II), Mg(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Co(II), Cu(I), Fe(II), Mn(II), Cd(II), Ca(II), and Ag(I)).

These parameters can accurately match the experimental binding free energy between 11 metal ions and acetate.

The findings demonstrate how the choice of the coordinate system influences the optimization process to reach an equilibrium structure. With fewer steps, internal coordinates outperform Cartesian coordinates, while the choice of the initial Hessian and Hessian update method in quasi-Newton approaches made by different optimization algorithms also contributes to the rate of convergence. Furthermore, an available open-source machine learning method based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) was evaluated for energy minimizations over surrogate potential energy surfaces with both Cartesian and internal coordinates with internal coordinates outperforming Cartesian. Overall, geomeTRIC and DL-FIND with their default optimization method as well as with the GPR-based model using Hartree-Fock theory with the 6-31G** basis set needed a comparable number of geometry optimization steps to the approach of Baker using a unit matrix as the initial Hessian to reach the optimized geometry.

This data set was generated to develop a neural network model that is capable of predicting the energy and the energy splitting as a function of the conformation of a Fe(II) organometallic complex. In order to achieve this, we propose a type of scaled electronic embedding to cover the long-range interactions implicitly in our neural network describing the Fe(II) organometallic complexes. For the total energy prediction, the lowest MAE is 0.037 eV, while the lowest MAE of the splitting energy is 0.030 eV. Compared to baseline models, which only incorporate short-range interactions, our scaled electronic embeddings improve the accuracy by over 70% for the prediction of the total energy and the splitting energy. With regard to semiempirical methods, our proposed models reduce the MAE, with respect to these methods, by 2 orders of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "Accurately determining the global minima of a molecular structure is important in diverse scientific fields, including drug design, materials science, and chemical synthesis. Conformational search engines serve as valuable tools for exploring the extensive conformational space of molecules and for identifying energetically favorable conformations. In this study, we present a comparison of Auto3D, CREST, Balloon, and ETKDG (from RDKit), which are freely available conformational search engines, to evaluate their effectiveness in locating global minima. These engines employ distinct methodologies, including machine learning (ML) potential-based, semiempirical, and force field-based approaches. To validate these methods, we propose the use of collisional cross-section (CCS) values obtained from ion mobility-mass spectrometry studies. We hypothesize that experimental gas-phase CCS values can provide experimental evidence that we likely have the global minimum for a given molecule. To facilitate this effort, we used our gas-phase conformation library (GPCL) which currently consists of the full ensembles of 20 small molecules and can be used by the community to validate any conformational search engine. Further members of the GPCL can be readily created for any molecule of interest using our standard workflow used to compute CCS values, expanding the ability of the GPCL in validation exercises. These innovative validation techniques enhance our understanding of the conformational landscape and provide valuable insights into the performance of conformational generation engines. Our findings shed light on the strengths and limitations of each search engine, enabling informed decisions for their utilization in various scientific fields, where accurate molecular structure determination is crucial for understanding biological activity and designing targeted interventions. By facilitating the identification of reliable conformations, this study significantly contributes to enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of molecular structure determination, with particular focus on metabolite structure elucidation. The findings of this research also provide valuable insights for developing effective workflows for predicting the structures of unknown compounds with high precision.",

Here, we applied an integrated approach to rationally alter the substrate preference of ZIP8, a Zrt-/Irt-like protein (ZIP) metal transporter with multiple natural substrates, and uncovered the determinants of substrate specificity. By systematically replacing the differentially conserved residues with the counterparts in the zinc transporter ZIP4, we created a zinc-preferring quadruple variant (Q180H/E343H/C310A/N357H), which exhibited largely reduced transport activities towards Cd2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ whereas increased activity toward Zn2+. Combined mutagenesis, modeling, covariance analysis, and computational studies revealed a conditional selectivity filter which functions only when the transporter adopts the outward-facing conformation. The demonstrated approach for transporter engineering and the gained knowledge about substrate specificity will facilitate engineering and mechanistic studies of other transporters.",

Further, complex and big data from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials also impose an obstacle in the drug discovery pipeline. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology play a crucial role in drug discovery and development. In other words, artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms have modernized the area. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented in several drug discovery processes such as peptide synthesis, structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure-activity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and physiochemical activity. Evidence from the past strengthens the implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning in this field. Moreover, novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recently developed modeling algorithms. In summary, artificial intelligence and deep learning advancements provide an excellent opportunity for rational drug design and discovery process, which will eventually impact mankind. The primary concern associated with drug design and development is time consumption and production cost. Further, inefficiency, inaccurate target delivery, and inappropriate dosage are other hurdles that inhibit the process of drug delivery and development. With advancements in technology, computer-aided drug design integrating artificial intelligence algorithms can eliminate the challenges and hurdles of traditional drug design and development. Artificial intelligence is referred to as superset comprising machine learning, whereas machine learning comprises supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Further, deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has been extensively implemented in drug design and development. The artificial neural network, deep neural network, support vector machines, classification and regression, generative adversarial networks, symbolic learning, and meta-learning are examples of the algorithms applied to the drug design and discovery process.

Although previous imidazole-M(II) parameters established the flexibility and reliability of the 12-6-4 Lennard-Jones (LJ)-type nonbonded model by simply tuning the ligating atom's polarizability, they have not been applied to multiple-imidazole complexes. To fill this gap, we systematically simulate multiple-imidazole complexes (ranging from one to six) for five metal ions (Co(II), Cu(II), Mn(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II)) which commonly appear in metalloproteins. Using extensive (40 ns per PMF window) sampling to assemble free energy association profiles (using OPC water and standard HID imidazole charge models from AMBER) and comparing the equilibrium distances to DFT calculations, a new set of parameters was developed to focus on energetic and geometric features of multiple-imidazole complexes. The obtained free energy profiles agree with the experimental binding free energy and DFT calculated distances. To validate our model, we show that we can close the thermodynamic cycle for metal-imidazole complexes with up to six imidazole molecules in the first solvation shell. Given the success in closing the thermodynamic cycles, we then used the same extended sampling method for six other metal ions (Ag(I), Ca(II), Cd(II), Cu(I), Fe(II), and Mg(II)) to obtain new parameters. Since these new parameters can reproduce the one-imidazole geometry and energy accurately, we hypothesize that they will reasonably predict the binding free energy of higher-level coordination numbers. Hence, we did not extend the analysis of these ions up to six imidazole complexes. Overall, the results shed light on metal-protein interactions by emphasizing the importance of ligand-ligand interaction and metal-π-stacking within metalloproteins.",

First, we modified the phosphate 12-6-4 LJ parameters to reproduce the solvation free energies of the series of phosphate anions using the thermodynamic integration (TI) method. Then, using the potential mean force (PMF) method, the polarizability of the metal-phosphate interaction was obtained. We show that the free energy profiles of phosphate ions coordinated to Ca2+ and Mg2+ generally show similar trends at longer metal-phosphate distances, while the absolute binding energy values increased with deprotonation.

With the development of machine learning (ML) tools, there are multiple ways to combine potential functions to create novel ML models and methods. Potential function parameters can be easily extracted; however, it is usually hard to directly obtain the calculated atom pairwise energies from scoring functions. Amber, as one of the most popular suites of modeling programs, has an extensive history and library of force field potential functions. In this work, we directly used the force field parameters in ff94 and ff14SB from Amber and encoded them to calculate atom pairwise energies for different interactions. Two sets of structures (single amino acid set and a dipeptide set) were used to evaluate the performance of our encoded Amber potentials. From the comparison results between energy terms obtained from our encoding and Amber, we find energy difference within ±0.06 kcal/mol for all tested structures. Previously we have shown that the Random Forest (RF) model can help to emphasize more important atom pairwise interactions and ignore insignificant ones [Pei, J.; Zheng, Z.; Merz, K. M. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2019, 59, 1919-1929]. Here, as an example of combining ML methods with traditional potential functions, we followed the same work flow to combine the RF models with force field potential functions from Amber. To determine the performance of our RF models with force field potential functions, 224 different protein native-decoy systems were used as our training and testing sets We find that the RF models with ff94 and ff14SB force field parameters outperformed all other scoring functions (RF models with KECSA2, RWplus, DFIRE, dDFIRE, and GOAP) considered in this work for native structure detection, and they performed similarly in detecting the best decoy. Through inclusion of best decoy to decoy comparisons in building our RF models, we were able to generate models that outperformed the score functions tested herein both on accuracy and best decoy detection, again showing the performance and flexibility of our RF models to tackle this problem. Finally, the importance of the RF algorithm and force field parameters were also tested and the comparison results suggest that both the RF algorithm and force field potentials are important with the ML scoring function achieving its best performance only by combining them together.

We trained neural-network prediction algorithms with our large dataset (>24,000 peptides) and outperformed algorithms trained on datasets of peptides with measured affinities. We thus demonstrate a strategy for systematically learning the rules of endogenous antigen presentation.",

        "abstract": "We report the development and testing of new integrated cyberinfrastructure for performing free energy simulations with generalized hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) in Amber. The Sander molecular dynamics program has been extended to leverage fast, density-functional tight-binding models implemented in the DFTB+ and xTB packages, and an interface to the DeePMD-kit software enables the use of MLPs. The software is integrated through application program interfaces that circumvent the need to perform \"system calls\" and enable the incorporation of long-range Ewald electrostatics into the external software's self-consistent field procedure. The infrastructure provides access to QM/MM models that may serve as the foundation for QM/MM-ΔMLP potentials, which supplement the semiempirical QM/MM model with a MLP correction trained to reproduce ab initio QM/MM energies and forces. Efficient optimization of minimum free energy pathways is enabled through a new surface-accelerated finite-temperature string method implemented in the FE-ToolKit package. Furthermore, we interfaced Sander with the i-PI software by implementing the socket communication protocol used in the i-PI client-server model. The new interface with i-PI allows for the treatment of nuclear quantum effects with semiempirical QM/MM-ΔMLP models. The modular interoperable software is demonstrated on proton transfer reactions in guanine-thymine mispairs in a B-form deoxyribonucleic acid helix. The current work represents a considerable advance in the development of modular software for performing free energy simulations of chemical reactions that are important in a wide range of applications.",

It was found that occupied orbitals of the density functional theory method obtained with B3LYP functional are not correctly ordered. Therefore, they cannot be used in investigations of the orbital structure of the upper molecular orbitals. A qualitative analysis of density functional theory method wave functions in terms of Mulliken and natural charges of atoms, together with an analysis of electrostatic potentials of the neutral [MePIm2] complex, its single and double cations, demonstrates that the highest occupied orbitals of these complexes are mainly formed by atomic orbitals of the porphyrin ring atoms. Therefore, transition metal atoms are not active in chemical reactions with these complexes unless the 3d electrons of transition metal atoms are excited, for example by light.

Oxidation to the 13‐oxo recovered catalysis. The experimental data for the debenzoylation reaction was supported by Gaussian‐accelerated molecular dynamics simulations that evaluated the conformational changes caused by different functional groups at C13 of the substrate.

Via parameter scanning, we fine-tuned the 12-6-4 LJ polarizability values to obtain accurate absolute binding free energies for the phosphate anions H2PO4-, HPO42-, PO43- coordinating with Ca2+ and Mg2+. First, we modified the phosphate 12-6-4 LJ parameters to reproduce the solvation free energies of the series of phosphate anions using the thermodynamic integration (TI) method. Then, using the potential mean force (PMF) method, the polarizability of the metal-phosphate interaction was obtained. We show that the free energy profiles of phosphate ions coordinated to Ca2+ and Mg2+ generally show similar trends at longer metal-phosphate distances, while the absolute binding energy values increased with deprotonation. The resulting parameters demonstrate the flexibility of the 12-6-4 LJ-type nonbonded model and its usefulness in accurately describing cation-anion interactions.",

        "abstract": "dynamics (MD) simulations facilitate the study of physical and chemical processes of interest. Traditional classical MD models lack reactivity to explore several important phenomena; while quantum mechanical (QM) models can be used for this purpose, they come with steep computational costs. The reactive force field (ReaxFF) model bridges the gap between these approaches by incorporating dynamic bonding and polarizability. To achieve realistic simulations using ReaxFF, model parameters must be optimized against high fidelity training data, typically with QM accuracy. Existing parameter optimization methods for ReaxFF consist of black-box techniques using genetic algorithms or Monte-Carlo methods. Due to the stochastic behavior of these methods, the optimization process can require millions of error evaluations for complex parameter fitting tasks, significantly hampering the rapid development of high quality parameter sets. In this work, we present JAX ReaxFF, a novel software tool that leverages modern machine learning infrastructure to enable extremely fast optimization of ReaxFF parameters. By calculating gradients of the loss function using the JAX library, we are able to utilize highly effective local optimization methods, such as the limited Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (LBFGS) and Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) methods. As a result of the performance portability of JAX, JAX-ReaxFF can execute efficiently on multi-core CPUs, GPUs (or even TPUs). By leveraging the gradient information and modern hardware accelerators, we are able to decrease parameter optimization time for ReaxFF from days to mere minutes. JAX-ReaxFF framework can also serve as a sandbox environment for domain scientists to explore customizing the ReaxFF functional form for more accurate modeling.",

Our previous experience (Pei et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2019, 59 (7), 3305-3315) proved that combining the random forest (RF) algorithm with knowledge-based potential functions can emphasize germane pair wise interactions and improve the performance of original knowledge-based potential functions on protein-ligand decoy detection. One of the most important potential function classes is the force field (FF) potential with one example being the Amber collection of FFs, which are widely available in the AMBER suite of simulation programs. However, for use in RF modeling studies, one needs pair wise energies that are hard to directly extract from Amber. To address this issue, FFENCODER-PL was constructed to calculate the pair wise energies based on the FF14SB and GAFF2 FFs in Amber. FFENCODER-PL was validated using 275 ligand and 21 protein-ligand structures. RF models were built by combining an RF classification algorithm with the pair wise energies calculated from FFENCODER-PL. CASF-2016 (Su et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2019, 59, 895-913) was employed to test the performance of the resultant RF models, which outperformed 33 scoring functions on accuracy and native ranking tests. For the best decoy RMSD test, RF models give a best decoy with an RMSD of around 2 Å from the native pose after including the best decoy-decoy comparisons in the RF model. The relative importance of the RF algorithm and force field potentials was also tested with the results suggesting that both the RF algorithm and force field potentials are important and combining them is the only way to achieve high accuracy. Finally, FFENCODER-PL makes force field-based pair wise energies available for further development of machine learning-based scoring functions.

Hence, the accurate prediction of PPIs by protein-protein docking and scoring tools is highly desirable in order to characterize their structure and biological function. Ab initio docking protocols are divided into the sampling of docking poses to produce at least one near-native structure, and then to evaluate the vast candidate structures by scoring. Concurrent development in both sampling and scoring is crucial for the deployment of protein-protein docking software. In the present work, we apply a machine learning model on pairwise potentials to refine the task of protein quaternary structure native structure detection among decoys. A decoy set was featurized using the Knowledge and Empirical Combined Scoring Algorithm 2 (KECSA2) pairwise potential. The highly unbalanced decoy set was then balanced using a comparison concept between native and decoy structures. The resultant comparison descriptors were used to train a logistic regression (LR) classifier. The LR model yielded the optimal performance for native detection among decoys compared with conventional scoring functions, while exhibiting lesser performance for the detection of low root mean square deviation decoy structures. Its deployment on an independent benchmark set confirms that the scoring function performs competitively relative to other scoring functions.

Interaction terms have been designed to account for van der Waals (VDW) contacts, hydrogen bonding, desolvation effects, and metal chelation to model the dissociation equilibrium constants using a linear model. Atom types have been introduced to differentiate the parameters for VDW, H-bonding interactions, and metal chelation between different atom pairs. A training set of 492 protein-ligand complexes was selected for the fitting process. Different test sets have been examined to evaluate its ability to predict experimentally measured binding affinities. By comparing with other well-known scoring functions, the results show that LISA has advantages over many existing scoring functions in simulating protein-ligand binding affinity, especially metalloprotein-ligand binding affinity. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was also used in order to demonstrate that the energy terms in LISA are well designed and do not require extra cross terms.",

Here we introduce a modular synthon-based approach-V-SYNTHES-to perform hierarchical structure-based screening of a REAL Space library of more than 11 billion compounds. V-SYNTHES first identifies the best scaffold-synthon combinations as seeds suitable for further growth, and then iteratively elaborates these seeds to select complete molecules with the best docking scores. This hierarchical combinatorial approach enables the rapid detection of the best-scoring compounds in the gigascale chemical space while performing docking of only a small fraction (<0.1%) of the library compounds. Chemical synthesis and experimental testing of novel cannabinoid antagonists predicted by V-SYNTHES demonstrated a 33% hit rate, including 14 submicromolar ligands, substantially improving over a standard virtual screening of the Enamine REAL diversity subset, which required approximately 100 times more computational resources. Synthesis of selected analogues of the best hits further improved potencies and affinities (best inhibitory constant (Ki) = 0.9 nM) and CB2/CB1 selectivity (50-200-fold).

The representation of thermal information in pIC is robust and somatotopically arranged, and reversible manipulations show a profound impact on thermal perception.

Here, we have examined the response of the low-frequency (below 6 terahertz) collective vibrations of the calcium-loaded calmodulin (CaM) to binding to five different ligands, both in the presence and absence of water, using normal-mode analysis and molecular dynamics simulations. A comparison of the vibrational spectra of hydrated and dry systems reveals that protein-solvent interactions stiffen the terahertz protein vibrations and that these solvent-coupled collective vibrations contribute significantly to the hydration-sensitive variation in the vibrational entropy of CaM. In the absence of water, the low-frequency vibrations of CaM are stiffened by ligand binding. On the contrary, the number and the cumulative vibrational entropy of low-frequency vibrational modes (ω < 200 cm-1) of the hydrated CaM are increased noticeably after binding to the peptides, indicating binding-induced softening of collective vibrations of the protein. Although the calculated and experimental binding affinities of the chosen complexes correlated reasonably well, no systematic correlation was observed between the protein vibrational entropy and the binding affinity.

We discuss the errors induced by the D&C approach, first empirically on a few examples, and then via a theoretical study of two toy models that can be analytically solved for any number of atoms. Thanks to the precision and speed of the D&C approach, we are able to demonstrate interactive quantum chemistry simulations for systems up to a few hundred atoms on a current multicore desktop computer. When drawing and editing molecular systems, interactive simulations provide immediate, intuitive feedback on chemical structures. As the number of cores on personal computers increases, and larger and larger systems can be dealt with, we believe such interactive simulations-even at lower levels of theory-should thus prove most useful to effectively understand, design and prototype molecules, devices and materials.",

        "abstract": "The motional dynamics of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging tools can significantly influence the measurement performance of such tools. NMR logging is used for geophysical evaluation in geological environments, primarily quantifying formation porosity and fluid volumes, as well as providing a qualitative estimation of permeability. NMR logging tools are conveyed via two main mechanisms; wireline logging and logging while drilling (LWD). We conduct detailed simulations to quantify the impact of tool motion on NMR measurements during logging. This involves conducting electromagnetic simulations which quantify the magnetic fields generated by a logging tool, and subsequently introducing motion profiles within the relevant spin dynamic calculations. This enables tool motional dynamics to be imposed on the signal acquisition. Several movement profiles are considered: linear axial movement to replicate wireline logging tool motion, as well as axial harmonic and lateral harmonic movement to simulate the shocks and vibrations experienced during logging while drilling. Lateral motion is observed to cause a greater degree of signal attenuation relative to axial motion due to the cylindrical shape of the excited volume. The magnitude of motion (e.g. the velocity of linear motion or the amplitude of harmonic motion) is demonstrated to increase the severity of signal attenuation, as expected. However, the frequency of harmonic motion demonstrates a more complex effect on the measured signal. The harmonic interaction between the motion frequency and measurement frequency (determined by the echo spacing) can cause wave interference which results in enhanced or diminished signal attenuation. Finally, we demonstrate that reducing both the magnetic field gradient as well as the echo spacing reduce the degree of signal attenuation observed during measurement. The results presented in this work demonstrate how the optimisation of key design parameters can be used to control the sensitivity of NMR logging tools towards motion.",

        "abstract": "There has been significant interest in developing fast and accurate quantum mechanical methods for modeling large molecular systems. In this work, by utilizing a machine learning regression technique, we have developed new low-cost quantum mechanical approaches to model large molecular systems. The developed approaches rely on using one-electron Gaussian-type functions called atom-centered potentials (ACPs) to correct for the basis set incompleteness and the lack of correlation effects in the underlying minimal or small basis set Hartree-Fock (HF) methods. In particular, ACPs are proposed for ten elements common in organic and bioorganic chemistry (H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, and Cl) and four different base methods: two minimal basis sets (MINIs and MINIX) plus a double-ζ basis set (6-31G*) in combination with dispersion-corrected HF (HF-D3/MINIs, HF-D3/MINIX, HF-D3/6-31G*) and the HF-3c method. The new ACPs are trained on a very large set (73 832 data points) of noncovalent properties (interaction and conformational energies) and validated additionally on a set of 32 048 data points. All reference data are of complete basis set coupled-cluster quality, mostly CCSD(T)/CBS. The proposed ACP-corrected methods are shown to give errors in the tenths of a kcal/mol range for noncovalent interaction energies and up to 2 kcal/mol for molecular conformational energies. More importantly, the average errors are similar in the training and validation sets, confirming the robustness and applicability of these methods outside the boundaries of the training set. In addition, the performance of the new ACP-corrected methods is similar to complete basis set density functional theory (DFT) but at a cost that is orders of magnitude lower, and the proposed ACPs can be used in any computational chemistry program that supports effective-core potentials without modification. It is also shown that ACPs improve the description of covalent and noncovalent bond geometries of the underlying methods and that the improvement brought about by the application of the ACPs is directly related to the number of atoms to which they are applied, allowing the treatment of systems containing some atoms for which ACPs are not available. Overall, the ACP-corrected methods proposed in this work constitute an alternative accurate, economical, and reliable quantum mechanical approach to describe the geometries, interaction energies, and conformational energies of systems with hundreds to thousands of atoms.",

        "abstract": "Human β defensin type 3 (hBD-3) is a small cationic cysteine-rich peptide. It has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities. However, at high concentrations, it also shows hemolytic activity by interrupting red blood cells. To understand the selectivity of hBD-3 disrupting cell membranes, investigating the capability of hBD-3 translocating through different membranes is important. Since hBD-3 in the analogue form in which all three pairs of disulfide bonds are broken has similar antibacterial activities to the wild-type, this project investigates the structure and dynamics of an hBD-3 analogue in monomer, dimer, and tetramer forms through both zwitterionic and negatively charged lipid bilayers using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. One tetramer structure of hBD-3 was predicted by running all-atom MD simulations on hBD-3 in water at a high concentration, which was found to be stable in water during 400 ns all-atom simulations based on root-mean-squared deviation, root-mean-squared fluctuation, buried surface area, and binding interaction energy calculations. After that, hBD-3 in different forms was placed inside different membranes, and then steered MD simulation was conducted to pull the hBD-3 out of the membrane along the z-direction to generate different configurational windows to set up umbrella-sampling (US) simulations. Because extensive sampling is important to obtain accurate free energy barriers, coarse-grained US MD simulations were performed in each window. Based on the long-term simulation result, membrane thinning was found near hBD-3 in different lipid bilayers and in different hBD-3 oligomer systems. By calculating the root-mean-squared deviation of the z-coordinate of hBD-3 molecules, rotation of the oligomer inside the bilayer and stretching of the oligomer structure along the z-direction were observed. Although reorientation of lipid heads toward the hBD-3 tetramer was observed based on the density profile calculation, the order parameter calculation shows that hBD-3 disrupts 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (POPS) lipids more significantly and makes it less ordered than on 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) lipids. Calculating the free energy of hBD-3 through different lipid bilayers, it was found that generally hBD-3 encounters a lower energy barrier through negatively charged lipid membranes than the zwitterionic membrane. hBD-3 in different forms needs to overcome a lower energy barrier crossing the combined POPC+POPS bilayer through the POPS leaflet than through the POPC leaflet. Besides that, the potential of mean force result suggests that hBD-3 forms an oligomer translocating negatively charged lipid membranes at a low concentration. This study supplied new insight into the antibacterial mechanism of hBD-3 through different membranes.",

Among cyclodextrins, the functionalized derivative known as hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) offers several advantages due to its unique structural features. Its optimal use in pharmaceutical and medical applications would benefit from a molecular-level understanding of its behavior, as can be offered by molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we propose a set of parameters for all-atom simulations of HPβCD, based on the ADD force field for sugars developed in our group, and compare it to the original CHARMM36 description. Using Kirkwood-Buff integrals of binary HPβCD-water mixtures as target experimental data, we show that the ADD-based description results in a considerably improved prediction of HPβCD self-association and interaction with water. We then use the new set of parameters to characterize the behavior of HPβCD toward the different amino acids. We observe pronounced interactions of HPβCD with both polar and nonpolar moieties, with a special preference for the aromatic rings of tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan. Interestingly, our simulations further highlight a preferential orientation of HPβCD's hydrophobic cavity toward the backbone atoms of amino acids, which, coupled with a favorable interaction of HPβCD with the peptide backbone, suggest a propensity for HPβCD to denature proteins.",

Currently, mass spectrometry and ab initio computation methods are widely used to evaluate PA; however, both methods are resource-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a critical need for efficient methods to estimate PA, enabling the rapid identification of the most favorable protonation site in complex organic molecules with multiple proton binding sites. In this work, we developed a fast and accurate method for PA prediction by using multiple descriptors in combination with machine learning (ML) models. Using a comprehensive set of 186 descriptors, our model demonstrated strong predictive performance, with an R2 of 0.96 and a MAE of 2.47kcal/mol, comparable to experimental uncertainty. Furthermore, we designed quantum circuits as feature encoders for a classical neural network. To evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid quantum-classical model, we compared its performance with traditional ML models using a reduced feature set derived from the full set. The result showed that this hybrid model achieved consistent performance comparable to traditional ML models with the same reduced feature set on both a noiseless simulator and real quantum hardware, highlighting the potential of quantum machine learning for accurate and efficient PA predictions.",

Here, we present the first density matrix embedding theory (DMET) simulations performed in combination with the sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) method.

We have shown in recent work that for a molecule of modest size with a proscribed conformational space we can successfully capture a conformation(s) that can match experimental CCS values. However, for flexible systems such as fatty acids that have many rotatable bonds and multiple intramolecular London dispersion interactions, it becomes necessary to sample a much greater conformational space. Sampling more conformers, however, accrues significant computational cost downstream in optimization steps involving quantum mechanics. To reduce this computational expense for lipids, we have developed a novel machine learning (ML) model to facilitate conformer filtering according to the estimated gas-phase CCS values. Herein we report that the implementation of our CCS knowledge-based approach for conformational sampling resulted in improved structure prediction agreement with experiment by achieving favorable average CCS prediction errors of ∼2% for lipid systems in both the validation set and the test set. Moreover, most of the gas-phase candidate conformations obtained by using CCS focusing achieved lower energy-minimum geometries than the candidate conformations without focusing. Altogether, the implementation of this ML model into our modeling workflow has proven to be beneficial for both the quality of the results and the turnaround time.

        "abstract": "Accurately computing the free energy for biological processes like protein folding or protein-ligand association remains a challenging problem. Both describing the complex intermolecular forces involved and sampling the requisite configuration space make understanding these processes innately difficult. Herein, we address the sampling problem using a novel methodology we term \"movable type\". Conceptually it can be understood by analogy with the evolution of printing and, hence, the name movable type. For example, a common approach to the study of protein-ligand complexation involves taking a database of intact drug-like molecules and exhaustively docking them into a binding pocket. This is reminiscent of early woodblock printing where each page had to be laboriously created prior to printing a book. However, printing evolved to an approach where a database of symbols (letters, numerals, etc.) was created and then assembled using a movable type system, which allowed for the creation of all possible combinations of symbols on a given page, thereby, revolutionizing the dissemination of knowledge. Our movable type (MT) method involves the identification of all atom pairs seen in protein-ligand complexes and then creating two databases: one with their associated pairwise distant dependent energies and another associated with the probability of how these pairs can combine in terms of bonds, angles, dihedrals and non-bonded interactions. Combining these two databases coupled with the principles of statistical mechanics allows us to accurately estimate binding free energies as well as the pose of a ligand in a receptor. This method, by its mathematical construction, samples all of configuration space of a selected region (the protein active site here) in one shot without resorting to brute force sampling schemes involving Monte Carlo, genetic algorithms or molecular dynamics simulations making the methodology extremely efficient. Importantly, this method explores the free energy surface eliminating the need to estimate the enthalpy and entropy components individually. Finally, low free energy structures can be obtained via a free energy minimization procedure yielding all low free energy poses on a given free energy surface. Besides revolutionizing the protein-ligand docking and scoring problem this approach can be utilized in a wide range of applications in computational biology which involve the computation of free energies for systems with extensive phase spaces including protein folding, protein-protein docking and protein design.",

We compared the results obtained with TI simulations with soft-core potentials and Hamiltonian replica exchange simulations with the serial insertion method combined with the BAR method. The results show that the difference between the two methods can be mainly attributed to the van der Waals free energies, suggesting that either the simulations used for TI or the simulations used for BAR, or both are not fully converged and the two sets of simulations may have sampled difference phase space regions. The penalty scores of force field parameters of the 10 guest molecules provided by CHARMM Generalized Force Field can be an indicator of the accuracy of binding free energy calculations.

The addition of excess glucose or methylglyoxal to the culture medium resulted in a dose-dependent loss of cell viability. We have also demonstrated that glyoxylase enzyme GloA plays a role in cell survival during glycation stress. In addition, we have provided evidence that carnosine, folic acid, and aminoguanidine inhibit glycation in prokaryotes. These agents may also prove to be beneficial to eukaryotes since the chemical processes of glycation are similar in these two domains of life.",

        "abstract": "Virus coat proteins spontaneously self-assemble into empty shells in aqueous solution under the appropriate physicochemical conditions, driven by an interaction free energy per bond on the order of 2-5 times the thermal energy kBT. For this seemingly modest interaction strength, each protein building block nonetheless gains a very large binding free energy, between 10 and 20 kBT. Because of this, there is debate about whether the assembly process is reversible or irreversible. Here we discuss capsid polymorphism observed in in vitro experiments from the perspective of nucleation theory and of the thermodynamics of mass action. We specifically consider the potential contribution of a curvature free energy term to the effective interaction potential between the proteins. From these models, we propose experiments that may conclusively reveal whether virus capsid assembly into a mixture of polymorphs is a reversible or an irreversible process.",

        "abstract": "Efforts to develop STAT3 inhibitors have focused on its SH2 domain starting with short phosphotyrosylated peptides based on STAT3 binding motifs, e.g. pY905LPQTV within gp130. Despite binding to STAT3 with high affinity, issues regarding stability, bioavailability, and membrane permeability of these peptides, as well as peptidomimetics such as CJ-887, have limited their further clinical development and led to interest in small-molecule inhibitors. Some small molecule STAT3 inhibitors, identified using structure-based virtual ligand screening (SB-VLS); while having favorable drug-like properties, suffer from weak binding affinities, possibly due to the high flexibility of the target domain. We conducted molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of the SH2 domain in complex with CJ-887, and used an averaged structure from this MD trajectory as an \"induced-active site\" receptor model for SB-VLS of 110,000 compounds within the SPEC database. Screening was followed by re-docking and re-scoring of the top 30% of hits, selection for hit compounds that directly interact with pY + 0 binding pocket residues R609 and S613, and testing for STAT3 targeting in vitro, which identified two lead hits with good activity and favorable drug-like properties. Unlike most small-molecule STAT3 inhibitors previously identified, which contain negatively-charged moieties that mediate binding to the pY + 0 binding pocket, these compounds are uncharged and likely will serve as better candidates for anti-STAT3 drug development. IMPLICATIONS: SB-VLS, using an averaged structure from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of STAT3 SH2 domain in a complex with CJ-887, a known peptidomimetic binder, identify two highly potent, neutral, low-molecular weight STAT3-inhibitors with favorable drug-like properties.",

        "abstract": "There is a pressing need for accurate force fields to assist in metalloprotein analysis and design. Recent work on the design of mimics of dimetal proteins highlights the requirements for activity. DF1 is a de novo designed protein, which mimics the overall fold and active site geometry of a series of diiron and dimanganese proteins. Specifically, the dimanganese form of DF1 is a mimic of the natural enzyme manganese catalase, which catalyzes the dismutation reaction of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. During catalytic turnover, the active site has to accommodate both the reduced and the oxidized state of the dimanganese core. The biomimetic protein DF1 is only stable in the reduced form and thus not active. Furthermore, the synthetic protein features an additional bridging glutamate sidechain, which occupies the substrate binding site. The goal of this study is to develop classical force fields appropriate for design of such important dimanganese proteins. To this aim, we use a nonbonded model to represent the metal-ligand interactions, which implicitly takes into account charge transfer and local polarization effects between the metal and its ligands. To calibrate this approach, we compare and contrast geometric and dynamical properties of manganese catalase and DF1. Having demonstrated a good correspondence with experimental structural data, we examine the effect of mutating the bridging glutamate to aspartate (M1) and serine (M2). Classical MD based on the refined forcefield shows that these point mutations affect not only the immediate coordination sphere of the manganese ions, but also the relative position of the helices, improving the similarity to Mn-catalase, especially in case of M2. On the basis of these findings, classical molecular dynamics calculations with the active site parameterization scheme introduced herein seem to be a promising addition to the protein design toolbox.",

        "abstract": "stallography is the primarily technique used to determine the three-dimensional (3D) structure of protein:ligand and protein:protein complexes, and it plays a central role in Structure Based Drug Design (SBDD). Recently, we integrated our quantum mechanics toolkit with the Phenix crystallographic package to replace the conventional stereochemical restraints with a more accurate QM/MM-based energy functional in \"real time\" during the refinement and we expanded this tool to include density driven solvation and tautomer/protomer/rotamer determination. While these methods are powerful, they suffer from the same limited radius of convergence as conventional methods, and their success is ultimately dependent upon the initial atom placement of the model. We have addressed this ligand placement problem with the use of a cutting edge free energy based algorithm (i.e. MovableType or MT). Unlike conventional free energy methods, the MT method along with the directly associated MTDock tool is an entirely novel way to assemble partition functions and, hence, free energies. Importantly, this method is based on fundamental statistical mechanics and does not rely on the use of expensive molecular dynamics, and it also does not suffer from many of the issues associated with conventional, energy-based found in typical docking and scoring methodologies. In this study, the MTDock algorithm coupled with the Phenix/DivCon package was validated against the highly diverse PDBBind set. We showed that we were able to routinely place ligands with a high degree of accuracy as measured by the crystallographic Z-score of the difference density metric (ZDD).",

        "abstract": "Fast and accurate biomolecular free energy estimation has been a significant interest for decades, and with recent advances in computer hardware, interest in new method development in this field has even grown. Thorough configurational state sampling using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has long been applied to the estimation of the free energy change corresponding to the receptor-ligand complexing process. However, performing large-scale simulation is still a computational burden for the high-throughput hit screening. Among molecular modeling tools, docking and scoring methods are widely used during the early stages of the drug discovery process in that they can rapidly generate discrete receptor-ligand binding modes and their individual binding affinities. Unfortunately, the lack of thorough conformational sampling in docking and scoring protocols leads to difficulty discovering global minimum binding modes on a complicated energy landscape. The Movable Type (MT) method is a novel absolute binding free energy approach which has demonstrated itself to be robust across a wide range of targets and ligands. Traditionally, the MT method is used with protein-ligand binding modes generated with rigid-receptor or flexible-receptor (induced fit) docking protocols; however, these protocols are by their nature less likely to be effective with more highly flexible targets or with those situations in which binding involves multiple step pathways. In these situations, more thorough samplings are required to better explain the free energy of binding. Therefore, to explore the prediction capability and computational efficiency of the MT method when using more thorough protein-ligand conformational sampling protocols, in the present work, we introduced a series of binding mode modeling protocols ranging from conventional docking routines to single-trajectory conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) and parallel Monte Carlo molecular dynamics (MCMD). Through validation against several structurally and mechanistically diverse protein-ligand test sets, we explore the performance of the MT method as a virtual screening tool to work with the docking protocols and as an MD simulation-based binding free energy tool.",

When exposed to UV energy, UV-photoinitiators (PI's) present in the formulations produce free radicals which catalyze polymerization of monomers and pre-polymers into resins. In addition to photopolymerization, other free radical reactions occur in these systems resulting in the formation of chemically varied photolytic decomposition products, many of which are low molecular weight chemical species with high migration potential. This research conducted model experiments in which 24 commonly used PI's were exposed to UV-energy at the typical upper limit of commercial UV-printing press conditions. UV-irradiated PI's were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) in order to identify photolytic decomposition products. Subsequently, migration studies of 258 UV-cure food packaging samples were conducted using GC-MS; PI's and photolytic decomposition products were found in nearly all samples analyzed. One hundred-thirteen photolytic decomposition products were identified. Eighteen intact PI's and 21 photolytic decomposition products were observed as migrants from the 258 samples analyzed, and these were evaluated for frequency of occurrence and migratory concentration range. The most commonly observed PI's were 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone and benzophenone. The most commonly observed photolytic decomposition products were 2,4,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde and 1-phenyl-2-butanone. This compilation of PI photolytic decomposition data and associated migration data will aid industry in identifying and tracing non-intentionally added substances (NIAS) in food packaging materials.",

It serves to protect the bacteria in environments that have lethal concentrations of these metals. The membrane fusion protein CusB is the periplasmic piece of CusCFBA, which has not been fully characterized by crystallography because of its extremely disordered N-terminal region. This region has both structural and functional importance because it has been experimentally proven to transfer the metal by itself from the metallochaperone CusF and to induce a structural change in the rest of CusB to increase Cu(I)/Ag(I) resistance. Understanding metal uptake from the periplasm is critical to gain insight into the mechanism of the whole CusCFBA pump, which makes resolving a structure for the N-terminal region necessary because it contains the metal binding site. We ran extensive molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the structural and dynamic properties of both the apo and Cu(I)-bound versions of the CusB N-terminal region. In contrast to its functional companion CusF, Cu(I) binding to the N-terminus of CusB causes only a slight, local stabilization around the metal site. The trajectories were analyzed in detail, revealing extensive structural disorder in both the apo and holo forms of the protein. CusB was further analyzed by breaking the protein up into three subdomains according to the extent of the observed disorder: the N- and C-terminal tails, the central beta strand motif, and the M21-M36 loop connecting the two metal-coordinating methionine residues. Most of the observed disorder was traced back to the tail regions, leading us to hypothesize that the latter two subdomains (residues 13-45) may form a functionally competent metal-binding domain because the tail regions appear to play no role in metal binding.",

A feature they all have in common is that, at typical resolutions, the experimental data need to be supplemented by empirical restraints, ensuring that the final structure is chemically reasonable. The restraints are accurate for amino acids and nucleic acids, but often less accurate for substrates, inhibitors, small-molecule ligands and metal sites, for which experimental data are scarce or empirical potentials are harder to formulate. This can be solved using quantum mechanical calculations for a small but interesting part of the structure. Such an approach, called quantum refinement, has been shown to improve structures locally, allow the determination of the protonation and oxidation states of ligands and metals, and discriminate between different interpretations of the structure. Here, we present a new implementation of quantum refinement interfacing the widely used structure-refinement software Phenix and the freely available quantum mechanical software ORCA. Through application to manganese superoxide dismutase and V- and Fe-nitrogenase, we show that the approach works effectively for X-ray and neutron crystal structures, that old results can be reproduced and structural discrimination can be performed. We discuss how the weight factor between the experimental data and the empirical restraints should be selected and how quantum mechanical quality measures such as strain energies should be calculated. We also present an application of quantum refinement to cryo-EM data for particulate methane monooxygenase and show that this may be the method of choice for metal sites in such structures because no accurate empirical restraints are currently available for metals.",

These methods generally lack explicit terms for electrostatics, polarization, dispersion, hydrogen bonds, and other key interactions, and instead they use pre-determined parameters (e.g. bond lengths, angles, and torsions) to drive structural refinement. In order to address this deficiency and obtain a more complete and ultimately more accurate structure, we have developed an automated approach for macromolecular refinement based on a two layer, QM/MM (ONIOM) scheme as implemented within our DivCon Discovery Suite and \"plugged in\" to two mainstream crystallographic packages: PHENIX and BUSTER. This implementation is able to use one or more region layer(s), which is(are) characterized using linear-scaling, semi-empirical quantum mechanics, followed by a system layer which includes the balance of the model and which is described using a molecular mechanics functional. In this work, we applied our Phenix/DivCon refinement method-coupled with our XModeScore method for experimental tautomer/protomer state determination-to the characterization of structure sets relevant to structure-based drug design (SBDD). We then use these newly refined structures to show the impact of QM/MM X-ray refined structure on our understanding of function by exploring the influence of these improved structures on protein:ligand binding affinity prediction (and we likewise show how we use post-refinement scoring outliers to inform subsequent X-ray crystallographic efforts).

To overcome this, we present a novel supervised ML model to predict the ΔGsol for an array of solvent-solute pairs. Using two different ensemble regressor algorithms, we made fast and accurate property predictions using open-source chemical features, encoding complex electronic, structural, and surface area descriptors for every solvent and solute. By integrating molecular properties and chemical interaction features, we have analyzed individual descriptor importance and optimized our model though explanatory information form feature groups. On aqueous and organic solvent databases, ML models revealed the predictive relevance of solutes with increasing polar surface area and decreasing polarizability, yielding better results than state-of-the-art benchmark Neural Network methods (without complex quantum mechanical or molecular dynamic simulations). Both algorithms successfully outperformed previous ΔGsol predictions methods, with a maximum absolute error of 0.22 ± 0.02 kcal mol-1, further validated in an external benchmark database and with solvent hold-out tests. With these explanatory and statistical insights, they allow a thoughtful application of this method for predicting other thermodynamic properties, stressing the relevance of ML modeling for further complex computational chemistry problems.",

Although the use of site-directed mutagenesis has greatly contributed to this goal, the approach is limited to the standard repertoire of twenty amino acids. Fluorinated amino acids have been utilized successfully to probe protein structure and dynamics as well as point to the importance of specific residues to biological function. In our continuing investigations on the importance of the amino acid methionine in biological systems, the successful incorporation of L-S-(trifluoromethyl)homocysteine (L-trifluoromethionine; L-TFM) into bacteriophage lambda lysozyme (LaL), an enzyme containing three methionine residues, is reported. The L isomer of TFM was synthesized in an overall yield of 33% from N-acetyl-D,L-homocysteine thiolactone and trifluoromethyl iodide. An expression plasmid giving strong overproduction of LaL was prepared and transformed into an Escherichia coli strain auxotrophic for methionine permitting the expression of LaL in the presence of L-TFM. The analogue would not support growth of the auxotroph and was found to be inhibitory to cell growth. However, cells that were initially grown in a Met-rich media followed by protein induction under careful control of the respective concentrations of L-Met and L-TFM in the media, were able to overexpress TFM-labeled LaL (TFM-LaL) at both high (70%) and low (31%) levels of TFM incorporation. TFM-LaL at both levels of incorporation exhibited analogous activity to the wild type enzyme and were inhibited by chitooligosaccharides indicating that incorporation of the analogue did not hinder enzyme function. Interestingly, the 19F solution NMR spectra of the TFM-labeled enzymes consisted of four sharp resonances spanning a chemical shift range of 0.9 ppm, with three of the resonances showing very modest shielding changes on binding of chitopentaose. The 19F NMR analysis of TFM-LaL at both high and low levels of incorporation suggested that one of the methionine positions gives rise to two separate resonances. The intensities of these two resonances were influenced by the extent of incorporation which was interpreted as an indication that subtle conformational changes in protein structure are induced by incorporated TFM.

        "abstract": "Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, with intense and sharp-line emission between red and near-infrared spectral regions, are of great interest for optoelectronic and bio-imaging applications. The growth of an inorganic passivation layer on nanocrystal surfaces is a common strategy to improve their chemical and optical stability and their photoluminescence quantum yield. In particular, cation exchange is a suitable approach for shell growth at the expense of the nanocrystal core size. Here, the cation exchange process is used to promote the formation of a CdS passivation layer on the surface of very small PbS nanocrystals (2.3 nm in diameter), blue shifting their optical spectra and yielding luminescent and stable nanostructures emitting in the range of 700-850 nm. Structural, morphological and compositional investigation confirms the nanocrystal size contraction after the cation-exchange process, while the PbS rock-salt crystalline phase is retained. Absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy demonstrate the growth of a passivation layer with a decrease of the PbS core size, as inferred by the blue-shift of the excitonic peaks. The surface passivation strongly increases the photoluminescence intensity and the excited state lifetime. In addition, the nanocrystals reveal increased stability against oxidation over time. Thanks to their absorption and emission spectral range and the slow recombination dynamics, such highly luminescent nano-objects can find interesting applications in sensitized photovoltaic cells and light-emitting devices.",

        "abstract": "In this review, recent developments in monitoring toxicological responses in estuarine animals are analyzed, considering the biomarker responses to different classes of pollutants. The estuarine environment imposes stressful conditions to the organisms that inhabit it, and this situation can alter their sensitivity to many pollutants. The specificity of some biomarkers like metallothionein tissue concentration is discussed in virtue of its dependence on salinity, which is highly variable in estuaries. Examples of cholinesterase activity measurements are also provided and criteria to select sensitive enzymes to detect pesticides and toxins are discussed. Regarding non-specific biomarkers, toxic responses in terms of antioxidant defenses and/or oxidative damage are also considered in this review, focusing on invertebrate species. In addition, the presence of an antioxidant gradient along the body of the estuarine polychaete Laeonereis acuta (Nereididae) and its relationship to different strategies, which deal with the generation of oxidative stress, is reviewed. Also, unusual antioxidant defenses against environmental pro-oxidants are discussed, including the mucus secreted by L. acuta. Disruption of osmoregulation by pollutants is of paramount importance in several estuarine species. In some cases such as in the estuarine crab Chasmagnathus granulatus, there is a trade off between bioavailability of toxicants (e.g. metals) and their interaction with key enzymes such as Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and carbonic anhydrase. Thus, the metal effect on osmoregulation is also discussed in the present review. Finally, field case studies with fish species like the croaker Micropogonias furnieri (Scianidae) are used to illustrate the application of DNA damage and immunosuppressive responses as potential biomarkers of complex mixture of pollutants.",

Purely classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods were used to study the free energy reaction profiles for the prenylation reaction in these enzymes. In the case of Orf2 we used QM/MM based X‐ray refinement tools to validate our computational observations. In FTase we identified a reaction intermediate, using MD simulations and potential of mean force (PMF) studies, that exists between the available X‐ray structures of the pre‐reactive complexes along the FTase reaction pathway. From our studies we have also provided insights into the experimental results regarding mutagenesis studies at position Y300 β(→ F). Experimentally multiple products were observed in the prenylation of 1,6‐dihyroxynaphthalene by Orf2, but the available crystal structures did not offer a complete understanding of this observation. Through MD and PMF studies we have rationalized how the enzyme accesses the two distinct reaction channels that result in the observed product distribution. Finally, we use QM/MM X‐ray refinement studies to verify our computationally predicted orientations of 1,6‐dihydroxynaphthalene and shown that our predicted structures satisfy the constraints of the experimental X‐ray density.

        "abstract": "With over 39,000 students, and research expenditures in excess of $200 million, George Mason University (GMU) is the largest R1 (Carnegie Classification of very high research activity) university in Virginia. Mason scientists have been involved in the discovery and development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics in areas as diverse as infectious diseases and cancer. Below are highlights of the efforts being led by Mason researchers in the drug discovery arena. To enable targeted cellular delivery, and non-biomedical applications, Veneziano and colleagues have developed a synthesis strategy that enables the design of self-assembling DNA nanoparticles (DNA origami) with prescribed shape and size in the 10 to 100 nm range. The nanoparticles can be loaded with molecules of interest such as drugs, proteins and peptides, and are a promising new addition to the drug delivery platforms currently in use. The investigators also recently used the DNA origami nanoparticles to fine tune the spatial presentation of immunogens to study the impact on B cell activation. These studies are an important step towards the rational design of vaccines for a variety of infectious agents. To elucidate the parameters for optimizing the delivery efficiency of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), Buschmann, Paige and colleagues have devised methods for predicting and experimentally validating the pKa of LNPs based on the structure of the ionizable lipids used to formulate the LNPs. These studies may pave the way for the development of new LNP delivery vehicles that have reduced systemic distribution and improved endosomal release of their cargo post administration. To better understand protein-protein interactions and identify potential drug targets that disrupt such interactions, Luchini and colleagues have developed a methodology that identifies contact points between proteins using small molecule dyes. The dye molecules noncovalently bind to the accessible surfaces of a protein complex with very high affinity, but are excluded from contact regions. When the complex is denatured and digested with trypsin, the exposed regions covered by the dye do not get cleaved by the enzyme, whereas the contact points are digested. The resulting fragments can then be identified using mass spectrometry. The data generated can serve as the basis for designing small molecules and peptides that can disrupt the formation of protein complexes involved in disease processes. For example, using peptides based on the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), Luchini, Liotta, Paige and colleagues disrupted the formation of IL-1/IL-R/IL-1RAcP complex and demonstrated that the inhibition of complex formation reduced the inflammatory response to IL-1B. Working on the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents, Bishop, van Hoek and colleagues have discovered a number of antimicrobial peptides from reptiles and other species. DRGN-1, is a synthetic peptide based on a histone H1-derived peptide that they had identified from Komodo Dragon plasma. DRGN-1 was shown to disrupt bacterial biofilms and promote wound healing in an animal model. The peptide, along with others, is being developed and tested in preclinical studies. Other research by van Hoek and colleagues focuses on in silico antimicrobial peptide discovery, screening of small molecules for antibacterial properties, as well as assessment of diffusible signal factors (DFS) as future therapeutics. The above examples provide insight into the cutting-edge studies undertaken by GMU scientists to develop novel methodologies and platform technologies important to drug discovery.",

This physically based approach has the ability to capture binding affinity trends in a diverse range of protein-ligand complexes. We also show the predictive power of this scoring function within protein targets and its ability to score ligand poses docked to a protein target. We also demonstrate the ability of this scoring function to discriminate between native and decoy poses and highlight the crucial role played by electrostatic interactions in molecular recognition.

All four receptor subtypes belong to the GTP-binding (G) protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This work consists of docking of YM087, a potent non-peptide V1aR and V2R - but not OTR - antagonist, into the receptor models based on relatively new theoretical templates of rhodopsin (RD) and opiate receptors, proposed by Mosberg et al. (Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA). It is simultaneously demonstrated that this RD template satisfactorily compares with the first historical GPCR structure of bovine rhodopsin (Palczewski et al., 2000) and that homology-modeling of V2R, V1aR and OTR using opiate receptors as templates is rational, based on relatively high (20-60%) sequence homology among the set of 4 neurophyseal and 4 opiate receptors. YM087 was computer-docked to V1aR, V2R and OTR using the AutoDock (Olson et al., Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, USA) and subsequently relaxed using restrained simulated annealing and molecular dynamics, as implemented in AMBER program (Kollman et al., University of California, San Francisco, USA).

We examined whether its beta-lactamase interactions resembled those of the available carbapenems, i.e., stable to AmpC and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases but labile to class B and functional group 2f enzymes. The comparator drugs were imipenem, oral cephalosporins, and amoxicillin. MICs were determined for beta-lactamase expression variants, and hydrolysis was examined directly with representative enzymes. Sanfetrinem was a weak inducer of AmpC beta-lactamases below the MIC and had slight lability, with a kcat of 0.00033 s(-1) for the Enterobacter cloacae enzyme. Its MICs for AmpC-derepressed E. cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were 4 to 8 microg/ml, compared with MICs of 0.12 to 2 microg/ml for AmpC-inducible and -basal strains; MICs for AmpC-derepressed Serratia marcescens and Morganella morganii were not raised. Cefixime and cefpodoxime were more labile than sanfetrinem to the E. cloacae AmpC enzyme, and AmpC-derepressed mutants showed much greater resistance; imipenem was more stable and retained full activity against derepressed mutants. Like imipenem, sanfetrinem was stable to TEM-1 and TEM-10 enzymes and retained full activity against isolates and transconjugants with various extended-spectrum TEM and SHV enzymes, whereas these organisms were resistant to cefixime and cefpodoxime. Sanfetrinem, like imipenem and cefixime but unlike cefpodoxime, also retained activity against Proteus vulgaris and Klebsiella oxytoca strains that hyperproduced potent chromosomal class A beta-lactamases. Functional group 2f enzymes, including Sme-1, NMC-A, and an unnamed enzyme from Acinetobacter spp., increased the sanfetrinem MICs by up to 64-fold. These enzymes also compromised the activities of imipenem and amoxicillin but not those of the cephalosporins. The hydrolysis of sanfetrinem was examined with a purified Sme-1 enzyme, and biphasic kinetics were found. Finally, zinc beta-lactamases, including IMP-1 and the L1 enzyme of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, conferred resistance to sanfetrinem and all other beta-lactams tested, and hydrolysis was confirmed with the IMP-1 enzyme. We conclude that sanfetrinem has beta-lactamase interactions similar to those of the available carbapenems except that it is a weaker inducer of AmpC types, with some tendency to select derepressed mutants, unlike imipenem and meropenem.",

Here, we proposed a modified aptamer enhanced library design strategy to facilitate the screening of target-binding aptamers. In this strategy, a comprehensive analysis of the original complexes and the target secondary structure were used to construct an enhanced initial library for screening. Our enhanced sequence library design strategy based on the target secondary structure explored a certain sequence space while ensuring the accuracy of the structural conformation and the calculation method. In an enhanced library of only a few dozen sequences, four sequences showed a similar or better binding free energy than the original aptamer, with consistently high binding stability over three rounds of multi-timescale simulations, ranging from - 30.27 to - 32.25 kcal/mol. Consequently, the enhanced library strategy based on the target secondary structure is shown to have very significant potential as a new aptamer design and optimization strategy.",

        "abstract": "\"Fail early and fail fast\" is the current paradigm that the pharmaceutical industry has adopted widely. Removing non-drug-like compounds from the drug discovery lifecycle in the early stages can lead to tremendous savings of resources. Thus, fast screening methods are needed to profile the large collection of synthesized and virtual libraries involved in the early stage. Solubility is one of the filters that are applied extensively to ensure that the compounds are reasonably soluble so that synthesis of the compounds and assay studies of pharmacokinetics and toxicity are feasible. To address this need, we have developed a fast quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model for the prediction of aqueous solubility (at 298 K, unbuffered solution) from the molecular structures. Multiple linear regressions and genetic algorithms were used to develop the models. The model was based on a set of diverse compounds including small organic molecules and drug and drug-like species. The predicted solubility for the training and test sets agrees well with the experimental values. The coefficient of determination is R(2) = 0.84 for the training set of 775 compounds and the RMS error = 0.87. This model was validated on four sets of compounds. The RMS error for the 1665 compounds from the four validation data sets (including compounds from the Physician's Desk References and Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry databases) is 1 log unit and the unsigned error is 0.77. This model does not require 3-D structure generation which is rather time-consuming. Using 2-D structure as input, this model is able to compute solubility for 90 000-700 000 compounds/h on a SGI Origin 2000 workstation. This kind of fast calculation allows the model to be used in data mining and screening of large synthesized or virtual libraries.",

        "abstract": "Molecular dynamics remains one of the most widely used computational tools in the theoretical molecular sciences to sample an equilibrium ensemble distribution and/or to study the dynamical properties of a system. The efficiency of a molecular dynamics calculation is limited by the size of the time step that can be employed, which is dictated by the highest frequencies in the system. However, many properties of interest are connected to low-frequency, long time-scale phenomena, requiring many small time steps to capture. This ubiquitous problem can be ameliorated by employing multiple time-step algorithms, which assign different time steps to forces acting on different time scales. In such a scheme, fast forces are evaluated more frequently than slow forces, and as the former are often computationally much cheaper to evaluate, the savings can be significant. Standard multiple time-step approaches are limited, however, by resonance phenomena, wherein motion on the fastest time scales limits the step sizes that can be chosen for the slower time scales. In atomistic models of biomolecular systems, for example, the largest time step is typically limited to around 5 fs. Previously, we introduced an isokinetic extended phase-space algorithm (Minary et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2004, 93, 150201) and its stochastic analog (Leimkuhler et al. Mol. Phys. 2013, 111, 3579) that eliminate resonance phenomena through a set of kinetic energy constraints. In simulations of a fixed-charge flexible model of liquid water, for example, the time step that could be assigned to the slow forces approached 100 fs. In this paper, we develop a stochastic isokinetic algorithm for multiple time-step molecular dynamics calculations using a polarizable model based on fluctuating dipoles. The scheme developed here employs two sets of induced dipole moments, specifically, those associated with short-range interactions and those associated with a full set of interactions. The scheme is demonstrated on the polarizable AMOEBA water model. As was seen with fixed-charge models, we are able to obtain large time steps exceeding 100 fs, allowing calculations to be performed 10 to 20 times faster than standard thermostated molecular dynamics.",

In each case, variations in binding affinities can be traced back to slight improvements or worsening of specific interactions with the protein of one or more ligand atoms. Isothermal calorimetry measurements show that the binding of this class of MMP inhibitors is largely enthalpy driven, but a favorable entropic contribution is always present. The binding enthalpy of acetohydroxamic acid (AHA), the prototype zinc-binding group in MMP drug discovery, has been also accurately measured. In principle, this research permits the planning of either improved inhibitors, or inhibitors with improved selectivity for one or another MMP. The present analysis is applicable to any drug target for which structural information on adducts with a series of homologous ligands can be obtained, while structural information obtained from in silico docking is probably not accurate enough for this type of study.",

In order to improve the lipophilicity of substituted diallyl ammonium chloride monomers under the premise of high cationic charge density, the simplest, most direct, and most efficient structure design strategy was selected in this paper. Only one of the substituents on DMDAAC quaternary ammonium nitrogen was modified by alkyl; the substituents were propyl and amyl groups, and their corresponding monomers were methyl propyl diallyl ammonium chloride (MPDAAC) and methyl amyl diallyl ammonium chloride (MADAAC), respectively. The effect of substituent structure on the homopolymerization activity of methyl alkyl diallyl ammonium chloride was illustrated by quantum chemical calculation and homopolymerization rate determination experiments via ammonium persulfate (APS) as the initiator system. The results of quantum chemistry simulation showed that, with the finite increase in substituted alkyl chain length, the numerical values of the bond length and the charge distribution of methyl alkyl diallyl ammonium chloride monomer changed little, with the activation energy of the reactions in the following order: DMDAAC < MPDAAC < MADAAC. The polymerization activities measured by the dilatometer method were in the order DMDAAC > MPDAAC > MADAAC. The activation energies Ea of homopolymerization were 96.70 kJ/mol, 97.25 kJ/mol, and 100.23 kJ/mol, and the rate equation of homopolymerization of each monomer was obtained. After analyzing and comparing these results, it could be easily found that the electronic effect of substituent was not obvious, whereas the effect of the steric hindrance was dominant. The above studies have laid a good foundation for an understanding of the polymerization activity of methyl alkyl diallyl ammonium chloride monomers and the possibility of preparation and application of these polymers with high molecular weight.",

Here we present results from molecular dynamics simulations of surfactant-solubilized subtilisin BPN' in three organic solvents (octane, tetrahydrofuran, and acetonitrile) and in pure water. Trajectories from simulations are analyzed with a focus on enzyme structure, flexibility, and the details of enzyme hydration. The overall enzyme and backbone structures, as well as individual residue flexibility, do not show significant differences between water and the three organic solvents over a timescale of several nanoseconds currently accessible to large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. The key factor that distinguishes molecular-level details in different media is the partitioning of hydration water between the enzyme and the bulk solvent. The enzyme surface and the active site region are well hydrated in aqueous medium, whereas with increasing polarity of the organic solvent (octane --> tetrahydrofuran --> acetonitrile) the hydration water is stripped from the enzyme surface. Water stripping is accompanied by the penetration of tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile molecules into crevices on the enzyme surface and especially into the active site. More polar organic solvents (tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile) replace mobile and weakly bound water molecules in the active site and leave primarily the tightly bound water in that region. In contrast, the lack of water stripping in octane allows efficient hydration of the active site uniformly by mobile and weakly bound water and some structural water similar to that in aqueous solution. These differences in the active site hydration are consistent with the inverse dependence of enzymatic activity on organic solvent polarity and indicate that the behavior of hydration water on the enzyme surface and in the active site is an important determinant of biological function especially in low water media.",

The protein binds indirectly to the prism ice face through a linear array of ordered water molecules that are structurally distinct from the ice.

The W47A/W242A mutant is an interfacially challenged enzyme, and it has been proposed that one or both tryptophan side chains serve as membrane interfacial anchors (Feng, J., Wehbi, H., and Roberts, M. F. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 19867-19875). The crystal structure supports this hypothesis. Relative to the crystal structure of the closely related (97% identity) wild-type PI-PLC from Bacillus cereus, significant conformational differences occur at the membrane-binding interfacial region rather than the active site. The Trp --> Ala mutations not only remove the membrane-partitioning aromatic side chains but also perturb the conformations of the so-called helix B and rim loop regions, both of which are implicated in interfacial binding. The crystal structure also reveals a homodimer, the first such observation for a bacterial PI-PLC, with pseudo-2-fold symmetry. The symmetric dimer interface is stabilized by hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, contributed primarily by a central swath of aromatic residues arranged in a quasiherringbone pattern. Evidence that interfacially active wild-type PI-PLC enzymes may dimerize in the presence of phosphatidylcholine vesicles is provided by fluorescence quenching of PI-PLC mutants with pyrene-labeled cysteine residues. The combined data suggest that wild-type PI-PLC can form similar homodimers, anchored to the interface by the tryptophan and neighboring membrane-partitioning residues.",

We review our published data that address the origin of the mechanical effects of cholesterol on unsaturated and polyunsaturated lipid membranes and their role in biomembrane functions. Through a combination of solid-state deuterium NMR spectroscopy and neutron spin-echo spectroscopy, we show that changes in molecular packing cause the universal effects of cholesterol on the membrane bending rigidity.

        "abstract": "Recrystallization of ice is a natural phenomenon that causes adverse effects in cryopreservation, agriculture, and in frozen food industry. It has long been recognized that ice recrystallization occurs through the Ostwald ripening and accretion processes. However, neither of these processes has been explored in microscopic detail by state-of-the-art experimental techniques. We carried out atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore ice recrystallization through the accretion process. Attempts have been made to elucidate the binding mechanism that is operating at the diffused ice-water interface. It is demonstrated that two ice crystals spontaneously recognize each other and bind together to form a large crystal in liquid water, resulting in ice recrystallization by accretion. Interestingly, the study reveals that the binding occurs due to the freezing of the interfacial water layer present between the two ice planes, even at a temperature above the melting point of the ice crystal. The synergistically enhanced ordering effect of two ice surfaces on the interfacial water leads to such freezing occurring during the binding process. However, proper crystallographic alignment is not necessarily required for the binding of the two crystals. Simulations have also been carried out to study the binding between an ice crystal and the model ice-binding surface (IBS) of an antifreeze protein above the melting point of the ice crystal. It is found that such binding at the IBS is accompanied by freezing of the interfacial water. This establishes that the synergetic ordering-driven freezing of interfacial water is a common binding mechanism at the diffused surfaces of ice crystals. We believe that this mechanism will provide a microscopic understanding of the process of recrystallization inhibition and thus help in designing suitable materials for potent applications in recrystallization inhibition.",

The IFN-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) inhibit virus infections by preventing virus membrane fusion with cells and by inhibiting fusion of infected cells (syncytialization). Fusion of placental trophoblasts via expression of endogenous retroviral fusogens known as syncytins forms the syncytiotrophoblast, a multinucleated cell structure essential for fetal development. We found here that IFN blocks fusion of BeWo human placental trophoblasts. Stably expressed IFITM1, -2, and -3 also blocked fusion of these trophoblasts while making them more resistant to virus infections. Conversely, stable IFITM knockdowns in BeWo trophoblasts increased their spontaneous fusion and allowed fusion in the presence of IFN while also making the cells more susceptible to virus infection. We additionally found that exogenous expression of IFITMs in HEK293T cells blocked fusion with cells expressing syncytin-1 or syncytin-2, confirming the ability of IFITMs to block individual syncytin-mediated fusion. Overall, our data indicate that IFITMs inhibit trophoblast fusion and suggest that there may be a critical balance between these antifusogenic effects and the beneficial antiviral effects of IFITMs in virus infections during pregnancy.",

We review the evolution of the field from its earliest days, placing particular emphasis on how this endeavor has illuminated our understanding of the principles underlying the folding and function of natural proteins, and is informing the design of macromolecules with unprecedented structures and properties. An initial set of milestones in de novo protein design focused on the construction of sequences that folded in water and membranes to adopt folded conformations. The first proteins were designed from first-principles using very simple physical models. As computers became more powerful, the use of the rotamer approximation allowed one to discover amino acid sequences that stabilize the desired fold. As the crystallographic database of protein structures expanded in subsequent years, it became possible to construct proteins by assembling short backbone fragments that frequently recur in Nature. The second set of milestones in de novo design involves the discovery of complex functions. Proteins have been designed to bind a variety of metals, porphyrins, and other cofactors. The design of proteins that catalyze hydrolysis and oxygen-dependent reactions has progressed significantly. However, de novo design of catalysts for energetically demanding reactions, or even proteins that bind with high affinity and specificity to highly functionalized complex polar molecules remains an importnant challenge that is now being achieved. Finally, the protein design contributed significantly to our understanding of membrane protein folding and transport of ions across membranes.

To better understand the role of lipid composition in the function of MSI-594, in the present study, eight different model membrane systems have been studied using accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations. The simulated results are helpful in discriminating the particular effects of cationic MSI-594 against zwitterionic POPC, anionic POPG and POPS, and neutral POPE lipid moieties. Additionally, the effects of various heterogeneous POPC/POPG (7 : 3), POPC/POPS (7 : 3), and POPG/POPE (1 : 3 and 3 : 1) bilayer systems on the dynamic interaction of MSI-594 have also been investigated. The effect on the lipid bilayer due to the interaction with the peptide is characterized by lipid acyl-chain order, membrane thickness, and acyl-chain dynamics. Our simulation results show that the lipid composition affects the membrane interaction of MSI-594, suggesting that membrane selectivity is crucial to its mechanism of action.

This has been realized, illustrating that an intrinsic and highly responsive fluorophore such as tryptophan can alter the course of an entire scientific discipline. But what about RNA and DNA? Adapting Weber's protein photophysics prophecy to nucleic acids requires the development of intrinsically emissive nucleoside surrogates as, unlike Trp, the canonical nucleobases display unusually low emission quantum yields, which render nucleosides, nucleotides, and oligonucleotides practically dark for most fluorescence-based applications.Over the past decades, we have developed emissive nucleoside surrogates that facilitate the monitoring of nucleoside-, nucleotide-, and nucleic acid-based transformations at a nucleobase resolution in real time. The premise underlying our approach is the identification of minimal atomic/structural perturbations that endow the synthetic analogs with favorable photophysical features while maintaining native conformations and pairing. As illuminating probes, the photophysical parameters of such isomorphic nucleosides display sensitivity to microenvironmental factors. Responsive isomorphic analogs that function similarly to their native counterparts in biochemical contexts are defined as isofunctional.Early analogs included pyrimidines substituted with five-membered aromatic heterocycles at their 5 position and have been used to assess the polarity of the major groove in duplexes. Polarized quinazolines have proven useful in assembling FRET pairs with established fluorophores and have been used to study RNA-protein and RNA-small-molecule binding. Completing a fluorescent ribonucleoside alphabet, composed of visibly emissive purine (thA, thG) and pyrimidine (thU, thC) analogs, all derived from thieno[3,4-d]pyrimidine as the heterocyclic nucleus, was a major breakthrough. To further augment functionality, a second-generation emissive RNA alphabet based on an isothiazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine core (thA, tzG, tzU, and tzC) was fabricated. This single-atom \"mutagenesis\" restored the basic/coordinating nitrogen corresponding to N7 in the purine skeleton and elevated biological recognition.The isomorphic emissive nucleosides and nucleotides, particularly the purine analogs, serve as substrates for diverse enzymes. Beyond polymerases, we have challenged the emissive analogs with metabolic and catabolic enzymes, opening optical windows into the biochemistry of nucleosides and nucleotides as metabolites as well as coenzymes and second messengers. Real-time fluorescence-based assays for adenosine deaminase, guanine deaminase, and cytidine deaminase have been fabricated and used for inhibitor discovery. Emissive cofactors (e.g., SthAM), coenzymes (e.g., NtzAD+), and second messengers (e.g., c-di-tzGMP) have been enzymatically synthesized, using xyNTPs and native enzymes. Both their biosynthesis and their transformations can be fluorescently monitored in real time.Highly isomorphic and isofunctional emissive surrogates can therefore be fabricated and judiciously implemented. Beyond their utility, side-by-side comparison to established analogs, particularly to 2-aminopurine, the workhorse of nucleic acid biophysics over 5 decades, has proven prudent as they refined the scope and limitations of both the new analogs and their predecessors. Challenges, however, remain. Associated with such small heterocycles are relatively short emission wavelengths and limited brightness. Recent advances in multiphoton spectroscopy and further structural modifications have shown promise for overcoming such barriers.",

The approach, developed in the United States, is based on four common, basic prima facie moral commitments--respect for autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice--plus concern for their scope of application. It offers a common, basic moral analytical framework and a common, basic moral language. Although they do not provide ordered rules, these principles can help doctors and other health care workers to make decisions when reflecting on moral issues that arise at work.",

        "abstract": "Farnesyltransferase (FT) inhibitors can suppress tumor cell proliferation without substantially interfering with normal cell growth, thus holding promise for cancer treatment. A structure-based approach to the design of improved FT inhibitors relies on knowledge of the conformational flexibility of the zinc-containing active site of FT. Although several X-ray structures of FT have been reported, detailed information regarding the active site conformational flexibility of the enzyme is still not available. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of FT can offer the requisite information, but have not been applied due to a lack of effective methods for simulating the four-ligand coordination of zinc in proteins. Here, we report in detail the problems that occurred in the conventional MD simulations of the zinc-bound FT and a solution to these problems by employing a simple method that uses cationic dummy atoms to impose orientational requirement for zinc ligands. A successful 1.0 ns (1.0 fs time step) MD simulation of zinc-bound FT suggests that nine conserved residues (Asn127alpha, Gln162alpha, Asn165alpha, Gln195alpha, His248beta, Lys294beta, Leu295beta, Lys353beta, and Ser357beta) in the active site of mammalian FT are relatively mobile. Some of these residues might be involved in the ligand-induced active site conformational rearrangement upon binding and deserve attention in screening and design of improved FT inhibitors for cancer chemotherapy.",

This complex reacts with 2,4-di-tert-butylphenolate at low temperature to produce a mixture of the catechol and quinone products, which proceeds through three intermediates (A-C) that have been characterized. A, stabilized at 153 K, is characterized as a phenolate-bonded bis-mu-oxo dicopper(III) species, which proceeds at 193 K to B, presumably a catecholate-bridged coupled bis-copper(II) species via an electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism wherein aromatic ring distortion is the rate-limiting step. Isotopic labeling shows that the oxygen inserted into the aromatic substrate during hydroxylation derives from dioxygen, and a late-stage ortho-H(+) transfer to an exogenous base is associated with C-O bond formation. Addition of a proton to B produces C, determined from resonance Raman spectra to be a Cu(II)-semiquinone complex. The formation of C (the oxidation of catecholate and reduction to Cu(I)) is governed by the protonation state of the distal bridging oxygen ligand of B. Parallels and contrasts are drawn between the spectroscopically and computationally supported mechanism of the DBED system, presented here, and the experimentally derived mechanism of the coupled binuclear copper protein tyrosinase.",

        "abstract": "Computational methods to predict drug permeability across biomembranes prior to synthesis are increasingly desirable to minimize the investment in drug design and development. Significant progress in molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methodologies applied to lipid bilayer membranes, for example, is making it possible to move beyond characterization of the membranes themselves to explore various thermodynamic and kinetic processes governing membrane binding and transport. Such methods are also likely to be directly applicable to the design and optimization of liposomal delivery systems. MD simulations are particularly valuable in addressing issues that are difficult to explore in laboratory experiments due to the heterogeneity of lipid bilayer membranes at the molecular level. Insights emerging from MD simulations are contributing to an understanding of which regions within bilayers are most and least favored by solutes at equilibrium as the solute structure is varied, local diffusivities of permeants, and the origin of the amplified selectivity to permeant size imposed by lipid bilayer membranes, particularly as changes in composition increase acyl chain ordering.",

        "abstract": "ocally polarizable multisite model based on the original cation dummy atom (CDA) model is described for molecular dynamics simulations of ions in condensed phases. Polarization effects are introduced by the electronegativity equalization model (EEM) method where charges on the metal ion and its dummy atoms can fluctuate to respond to the environment. This model includes explicit polarization and ion-induced interactions and can be coupled with nonpolarizable or polarizable water models, making it more transferable to simpler force fields. This approach allows us to enhance the original fixed charge CDA model where the charge distribution cannot adapt to the local solvent structure. To illustrate the new CDApol model, we examined properties of the Zn2+, Al3+, and Zr4+ ions in aqueous solution. The polarizable model and Lennard-Jones parameters were refined for octahedrally coordinated Zn2+, Al3+, and Zr4+ CDAs to reproduce thermodynamic and geometrical properties. Using this locally polarizable model, we were able to obtain the experimental hydration free energy, ion-oxygen distance, and coordination number coupled with the standard 12-6 Lennard-Jones model. This model can be used in myriad additional applications where local polarization and charge transfer is important.",

        "abstract": "Crystallography and quantum mechanics have always been tightly connected because reliable quantum mechanical models are needed to determine crystal structures. Due to this natural synergy, nowadays accurate distributions of electrons in space can be obtained from diffraction and scattering experiments. In the original definition of quantum crystallography (QCr) given by Massa, Karle and Huang, direct extraction of wavefunctions or density matrices from measured intensities of reflections or, conversely, ad hoc quantum mechanical calculations to enhance the accuracy of the crystallographic refinement are implicated. Nevertheless, many other active and emerging research areas involving quantum mechanics and scattering experiments are not covered by the original definition although they enable to observe and explain quantum phenomena as accurately and successfully as the original strategies. Therefore, we give an overview over current research that is related to a broader notion of QCr, and discuss options how QCr can evolve to become a complete and independent domain of natural sciences. The goal of this paper is to initiate discussions around QCr, but not to find a final definition of the field.",

        "abstract": "um mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach is an essential and well-established tool in computational chemistry that has been widely applied in a myriad of biomolecular problems in the literature. In this publication, we report the integration of the QUantum Interaction Computational Kernel (QUICK) program as an engine to perform electronic structure calculations in QM/MM simulations with AMBER. This integration is available through either a file-based interface (FBI) or an application programming interface (API). Since QUICK is an open-source GPU-accelerated code with multi-GPU parallelization, users can take advantage of \"free of charge\" GPU-acceleration in their QM/MM simulations. In this work, we discuss implementation details and give usage examples. We also investigate energy conservation in typical QM/MM simulations performed at the microcanonical ensemble. Finally, benchmark results for two representative systems in bulk water, the N-methylacetamide (NMA) molecule and the photoactive yellow protein (PYP), show the performance of QM/MM simulations with QUICK and AMBER using a varying number of CPU cores and GPUs. Our results highlight the acceleration obtained from a single or multiple GPUs; we observed speedups of up to 53× between a single GPU vs a single CPU core and of up to 2.6× when comparing four GPUs to a single GPU. Results also reveal speedups of up to 3.5× when the API is used instead of FBI.",

        "title": "Enhanced Conformational Space Sampling Improves the Prediction of Chemical Shifts in Proteins",
        "abstract": "A biased-potential molecular dynamics simulation method, accelerated molecular dynamics (AMD), was combined with the chemical shift prediction algorithm SHIFTX to calculate (1)H(N), (15)N, (13)Calpha, (13)Cbeta, and (13)C' chemical shifts of the ankyrin repeat protein IkappaBalpha (residues 67-206), the primary inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB). Free-energy-weighted molecular ensembles were generated over a range of acceleration levels, affording systematic enhancement of the conformational space sampling of the protein. We have found that the predicted chemical shifts, particularly for the (15)N, (13)Calpha, and (13)Cbeta nuclei, improve substantially with enhanced conformational space sampling up to an optimal acceleration level. Significant improvement in the predicted chemical shift data coincides with those regions of the protein that exhibit backbone dynamics on longer time scales. Interestingly, the optimal acceleration level for reproduction of the chemical shift data has previously been shown to best reproduce the experimental residual dipolar coupling (RDC) data for this system, as both chemical shift data and RDCs report on an ensemble and time average in the millisecond range.",

        "abstract": "Oncostatin M (OSM) is a pleiotropic, interleukin-6 family inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer progression and metastasis. Recently, elevated OSM levels have been found in the serum of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units. Multiple anti-OSM therapeutics have been investigated, but to date no OSM small molecule inhibitors are clinically available. To pursue a high-throughput screening and structure-based drug discovery strategy to design a small molecule inhibitor of OSM, milligram quantities of highly pure, bioactive OSM are required. Here, we developed a reliable protocol to produce highly pure unlabeled and isotope enriched OSM from E. coli for biochemical and NMR studies. High yields (ca. 10 mg/L culture) were obtained in rich and minimal defined media cultures. Purified OSM was characterized by mass spectrometry and circular dichroism. The bioactivity was confirmed by induction of OSM/OSM receptor signaling through STAT3 phosphorylation in human breast cancer cells. Optimized buffer conditions yielded 1H, 15N HSQC NMR spectra with intense, well-dispersed peaks. Titration of 15N OSM with a small molecule inhibitor showed chemical shift perturbations for several key residues with a binding affinity of 12.2 ± 3.9 μM. These results demonstrate the value of bioactive recombinant human OSM for NMR-based small molecule screening.",
