To systematically evaluate the performance of these methods, we report here an extensive study of 59 ligands interacting with six different proteins. First, we explored the effects of the length of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, ranging from 400 to 4800 ps, and the solute dielectric constant (1, 2, or 4) on the binding free energies predicted by MM/PBSA. The following three important conclusions could be observed: (1) MD simulation length has an obvious impact on the predictions, and longer MD simulation is not always necessary to achieve better predictions. (2) The predictions are quite sensitive to the solute dielectric constant, and this parameter should be carefully determined according to the characteristics of the protein/ligand binding interface. (3) Conformational entropy often show large fluctuations in MD trajectories, and a large number of snapshots are necessary to achieve stable predictions. Next, we evaluated the accuracy of the binding free energies calculated by three Generalized Born (GB) models. We found that the GB model developed by Onufriev and Case was the most successful model in ranking the binding affinities of the studied inhibitors. Finally, we evaluated the performance of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA in predicting binding free energies.

Nowadays, as a variety of docking programs are available for the scientific community, a comprehensive understanding of the advantages and limitations of each docking program is fundamentally important to conduct more reasonable docking studies and docking-based virtual screening. In the present study, based on an extensive dataset of 2002 protein-ligand complexes from the PDBbind database (version 2014), the performance of ten docking programs, including five commercial programs (LigandFit, Glide, GOLD, MOE Dock, and Surflex-Dock) and five academic programs (AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, LeDock, rDock, and UCSF DOCK), was systematically evaluated by examining the accuracies of binding pose prediction (sampling power) and binding affinity estimation (scoring power). Our results showed that GOLD and LeDock had the best sampling power (GOLD: 59.8% accuracy for the top scored poses; LeDock: 80.8% accuracy for the best poses) and AutoDock Vina had the best scoring power (rp/rs of 0.564/0.580 and 0.569/0.584 for the top scored poses and best poses), suggesting that the commercial programs did not show the expected better performance than the academic ones. Overall, the ligand binding poses could be identified in most cases by the evaluated docking programs but the ranks of the binding affinities for the entire dataset could not be well predicted by most docking programs. However, for some types of protein families, relatively high linear correlations between docking scores and experimental binding affinities could be achieved.

Most scoring functions implemented in popular docking software packages were developed with many approximations for computational efficiency, which sacrifices the accuracy of prediction. With advanced technology and powerful computational hardware nowadays, it is feasible to use rigorous scoring functions, such as molecular mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) and molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) in molecular docking studies. Here, we systematically investigated the performance of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA to identify the correct binding conformations and predict the binding free energies for 98 protein-ligand complexes. Comparison studies showed that MM/GBSA (69.4%) outperformed MM/PBSA (45.5%) and many popular scoring functions to identify the correct binding conformations. Moreover, we found that molecular dynamics simulations are necessary for some systems to identify the correct binding conformations. Based on our results, we proposed the guideline for MM/GBSA to predict the binding conformations. We then tested the performance of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA to reproduce the binding free energies of the 98 protein-ligand complexes. The best prediction of MM/GBSA model with internal dielectric constant 2.0, produced a Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.66, which is better than MM/PBSA (0.49) and almost all scoring functions used in molecular docking.

The results can be summarized as follows: (1) for the one-protein-family/one-binding-ligand case which represents the unbiased protein-ligand complex sampling, both MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA methodologies achieve approximately equal accuracies at the interior dielectric constant of 4 (with rp = 0.408 ± 0.006 of MM/GBSA and rp = 0.388 ± 0.006 of MM/PBSA based on the minimized structures); while for the total dataset (1864 crystal structures), the overall best Pearson correlation coefficient (rp = 0.579 ± 0.002) based on MM/GBSA is better than that of MM/PBSA (rp = 0.491 ± 0.003), indicating that biased sampling may significantly affect the accuracy of the predicted result (some protein families contain too many instances and can bias the overall predicted accuracy). Therefore, family based classification is needed to evaluate the two methodologies; (2) the prediction accuracies of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA for different protein families are quite different with rp ranging from 0 to 0.9, whereas the correlation and ranking scores (an averaged rp/rs over a list of protein folds and also representing the unbiased sampling) given by MM/PBSA (rp-score = 0.506 ± 0.050 and rs-score = 0.481 ± 0.052) are comparable to those given by MM/GBSA (rp-score = 0.516 ± 0.047 and rs-score = 0.463 ± 0.047) at the fold family level; (3) for the overall prediction accuracies, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation may not be quite necessary for MM/GBSA (rp-minimized = 0.579 ± 0.002 and rp-1ns = 0.564 ± 0.002), but is needed for MM/PBSA (rp-minimized = 0.412 ± 0.003 and rp-1ns = 0.491 ± 0.003). However, for the individual systems, whether to use MD simulation is depended. (4) both MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA may be unable to give successful predictions for the ligands with high formal charges, with the Pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0.621 ± 0.003 (neutral ligands) to 0.125 ± 0.142 (ligands with a formal charge of 5). Therefore, it can be summarized that, although MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA perform similarly in the unbiased dataset, for the currently available crystal structures in the PDBbind database, compared with MM/GBSA, which may be used in multi-target comparisons, MM/PBSA is more sensitive to the investigated systems, and may be more suitable for individual-target-level binding free energy ranking.

Protein-protein docking can afford the atomic structural details of protein-protein complexes, but the accurate prediction of the three-dimensional structures for protein-protein systems is still notoriously difficult due in part to the lack of an ideal scoring function for protein-protein docking. Compared with most scoring functions used in protein-protein docking, the Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) and Molecular Mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) methodologies are more theoretically rigorous, but their overall performance for the predictions of binding affinities and binding poses for protein-protein systems has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we first evaluated the performance of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA to predict the binding affinities for 46 protein-protein complexes. On the whole, different force fields, solvation models, and interior dielectric constants have obvious impacts on the prediction accuracy of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA. The MM/GBSA calculations based on the ff02 force field, the GB model developed by Onufriev et al. and a low interior dielectric constant (εin = 1) yield the best correlation between the predicted binding affinities and the experimental data (rp = -0.647), which is better than MM/PBSA (rp = -0.523) and a number of empirical scoring functions used in protein-protein docking (rp = -0.141 to -0.529). Then, we examined the capability of MM/GBSA to identify the possible near-native binding structures from the decoys generated by ZDOCK for 43 protein-protein systems. The results illustrate that the MM/GBSA rescoring has better capability to distinguish the correct binding structures from the decoys than the ZDOCK scoring. Besides, the optimal interior dielectric constant of MM/GBSA for re-ranking docking poses may be determined by analyzing the characteristics of protein-protein binding interfaces.

Here, we systematically investigated entropy effects on the prediction power of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA using >1500 protein-ligand systems and six representative AMBER force fields. Two computationally efficient methods, including NMA based on truncated structures and the interaction entropy approach, were used to estimate the entropic contributions to ligand-target binding free energies. In terms of the overall accuracy, we found that, for the minimized structures, in most cases the inclusion of the conformational entropies predicted by truncated NMA (enthalpynmode_min_9Å) compromises the overall accuracy of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA compared with the enthalpies calculated based on the minimized structures (enthalpymin). However, for the MD trajectories, the binding free energies can be improved by the inclusion of the conformation entropies predicted by either truncated-NMA for a relatively high dielectric constant (εin = 4) or the interaction entropy method for εin = 1-4. In terms of reproducing the absolute binding free energies, the binding free energies estimated by including the truncated-NMA entropies based on the MD trajectories (ΔGnmode_md_9Å) give the lowest average absolute deviations against the experimental data among all the tested strategies for both MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA. Although the inclusion of the truncated NMA based on the MD trajectories (ΔGnmode_md_9Å) for a relatively high dielectric constant gave the overall best result and the lowest average absolute deviations against the experimental data (for the ff03 force field), it needs too much computational time. Alternatively, considering that the interaction entropy method does not incur any additional computational cost and can give comparable (at high dielectric constant, εin = 4) or even better (at low dielectric constant, εin = 1-2) results than the truncated-NMA entropy (ΔGnmode_md_9Å), the interaction entropy approach is recommended to estimate the entropic component for MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA based on MD trajectories, especially for a diverse dataset. Furthermore, we compared the predictions of MM/GBSA with six different AMBER force fields.

The correlation analysis between the intestinal absorption and several important molecular properties demonstrated that no single molecular property could be used as a good discriminator to efficiently distinguish the poorly absorbed compounds from those that are well absorbed. The theoretical correlation models for a training set of 455 compounds were proposed by using the genetic function approximation technique. The best prediction model contains four molecular descriptors: topological polar surface area, the predicted distribution coefficient at pH = 6.5, the number of violations of the Lipinski's rule-of-five, and the square of the number of hydrogen-bond donors. The model was able to predict the fractional absorption with an r = 0.84 and a prediction error (absolute mean error) of 11.2% for the training set. Moreover, it achieves an r = 0.90 and a prediction error of 7.8% for a 98-compound test set. The recursive partitioning technique was applied to find the simple hierarchical rules to classify the compounds into poor (%FA < or = 30%) and good (%FA > 30%) intestinal absorption classes. The high quality of the classification model was validated by the satisfactory predictions on the training set (correctly identifying 95.9% of the compounds in the poor-absorption class and 96.1% of the compounds in the good-absorption class) and on the test set (correctly identifying 100% of the compounds in the poor-absorption class and 96.8% of the compounds in the good-absorption class). We expect that, in the future, the rules for the prediction of carrier-mediated transporting and first pass metabolism can be integrated into the current hierarchical rules, and the classification model may become more powerful in the prediction of intestinal absorption or even human bioavailability.

A training set of 77 structurally diverse organic molecules was used to construct significant QSAR models for Caco-2 cell permeation. Cellular permeation was found to depend primarily upon experimental distribution coefficient (logD) at pH = 7.4, high charged polar surface area (HCPSA), and radius of gyration (rgyr). Among these three descriptors, logD may have the largest impact on diffusion through Caco-2 cell because logD shows obvious linear correlation with logPapp (r=0.703) when logD is smaller than 2.0. High polar surface area will be unfavorable to achieve good Caco-2 permeability because higher polar surface area will introduce stronger H-bonding interactions between Caco-2 cells and drugs. The comparison among HCPSA, PSA (polar surface area), and TPSA (topological polar surface area) implies that high-charged atoms may be more important to the interactions between Caco-2 cell and drugs. Besides logD and HCPSA, rgyr is also closely connected with Caco-2 permeabilities. The molecules with larger rgyr are more difficult to cross Caco-2 monolayers than those with smaller rgyr. The descriptors included in the prediction models permit the interpretation in structural terms of the passive permeability process, evidencing the main role of lipholiphicity, H-bonding, and bulk properties. Besides these three molecular descriptors, the influence of other molecular descriptors was also investigated. From the calculated results, it can be found that introducing descriptors concerned with molecular flexibility can improve the linear correlation. The resulting model with four descriptors bears good statistical significance, n = 77, r = 0.82, q = 0.79, s = 0.45, F = 35.7. The actual predictive abilities of the QSAR model were validated through an external validation test set of 23 diverse compounds. The predictions for the tested compounds are as the same accuracy as the compounds of the training set and significantly better than those predicted by using the model reported.

The use of smart computational methods in the life cycle of drug design is relatively a recent development that has gained much popularity and interest over the last few years. Central to this methodology is the notion of computational docking which is the process of predicting the best pose (orientation + conformation) of a small molecule (drug candidate) when bound to a target larger receptor molecule (protein) in order to form a stable complex molecule. In computational docking, a large number of binding poses are evaluated and ranked using a scoring function. The scoring function is a mathematical predictive model that produces a score that represents the binding free energy, and hence the stability, of the resulting complex molecule. Generally, such a function should produce a set of plausible ligands ranked according to their binding stability along with their binding poses. In more practical terms, an effective scoring function should produce promising drug candidates which can then be synthesized and physically screened using high throughput screening process. Therefore, the key to computer-aided drug design is the design of an efficient highly accurate scoring function (using ML techniques).",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9a297e83ca2bf1b3af089e51d85e927544ddfe04,It is believed that the continuous improvement in ML‐based SFs can surely guide the early‐stage drug design and accelerate the discovery of new drugs.,MA.

Characterizing the interaction interface of domain-peptide complexes and predicting binding specificity for modular domains are critical for deciphering protein-protein interaction networks. Here, we propose the use of an energetic decomposition analysis to characterize domain-peptide interactions and the molecular interaction energy components (MIECs), including van der Waals, electrostatic, and desolvation energy between residue pairs on the binding interface. We show a proof-of-concept study on the amphiphysin-1 SH3 domain interacting with its peptide ligands. The structures of the human amphiphysin-1 SH3 domain complexed with 884 peptides were first modeled using virtual mutagenesis and optimized by molecular mechanics (MM) minimization. Next, the MIECs between domain and peptide residues were computed using the MM/generalized Born decomposition analysis. We conducted two types of statistical analyses on the MIECs to demonstrate their usefulness for predicting binding affinities of peptides and for classifying peptides into binder and non-binder categories. First, combining partial least squares analysis and genetic algorithm, we fitted linear regression models between the MIECs and the peptide binding affinities on the training data set. These models were then used to predict binding affinities for peptides in the test data set; the predicted values have a correlation coefficient of 0.81 and an unsigned mean error of 0.39 compared with the experimentally measured ones. The partial least squares-genetic algorithm analysis on the MIECs revealed the critical interactions for the binding specificity of the amphiphysin-1 SH3 domain. Next, a support vector machine (SVM) was employed to build classification models based on the MIECs of peptides in the training set. A rigorous training-validation procedure was used to assess the performances of different kernel functions in SVM and different combinations of the MIECs. The best SVM classifier gave satisfactory predictions for the test set, indicated by average prediction accuracy rates of 78% and 91% for the binding and non-binding peptides, respectively. We also showed that the performance of our approach on both binding affinity prediction and binder/non-binder classification was superior to the performances of the conventional MM/Poisson-Boltzmann solvent-accessible surface area and MM/generalized Born solvent-accessible surface area calculations.

An efficient sampling strategy has been proposed and tested in the calculation of the diffusion coefficients of solutes in solutions. There are two major findings of this study. First of all, the diffusion coefficients of organic solutes in aqueous solution can be well predicted: the average unsigned errors and the root mean square errors are 0.137 and 0.171 × 10(-5) cm(-2) s(-1), respectively. Second, although the absolute values of D cannot be predicted, good correlations have been achieved for eight organic solvents with experimental data (R(2) = 0.784), four proteins in aqueous solutions (R(2) = 0.996), and nine organic compounds in nonaqueous solutions (R(2) = 0.834).

It is important but challenging to determine the binding specificity of these domains accurately and to predict their physiological interacting partners. In this study, the interactions between 35 peptide ligands (15 binders and 20 non-binders) and the Abl SH3 domain were analyzed using molecular dynamics simulation and the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Solvent Area method. The calculated binding free energies correlated well with the rank order of the binding peptides and clearly distinguished binders from non-binders. Free energy component analysis revealed that the van der Waals interactions dictate the binding strength of peptides, whereas the binding specificity is determined by the electrostatic interaction and the polar contribution of desolvation. The binding motif of the Abl SH3 domain was then determined by a virtual mutagenesis method, which mutates the residue at each position of the template peptide relative to all other 19 amino acids and calculates the binding free energy difference between the template and the mutated peptides using the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Solvent Area method. A single position mutation free energy profile was thus established and used as a scoring matrix to search peptides recognized by the Abl SH3 domain in the human genome.

The best model is based on three descriptors: n-octanol/water partition coefficient calculated using the SLOGP approach, logP; high-charged polar surface areas based on the Gasteiger partial charges, HCPSA, and the excessive molecular weight larger than 360, MW(360). The model bears good statistical significance, n = 78, r = 0.88, q = 0.86, s = 0.36, F = 81.5. The actual prediction potential of the model was validated through two external validation sets of 37 diverse compounds. The predicted results demonstrate that the model bears better prediction potential than many other models and can be used for logBB estimations for drug and drug-like molecules. Comparison of several logP calculation approaches suggests that logP calculated by SLOGP can be used as a significant descriptor for the prediction of molecular transport properties because SLOGP gives the most similar results with CLOGP. The QSPR model indicates that larger polar surface areas have a more negative contribution to logBB, but the absolute partial charges on the atoms surrounded by the polar surfaces should be larger than 0.10|e|. Meanwhile, tight junction membranes limit the size of hydrophilic molecules that can cross the membrane with a molecular weight of approximately 360, because when a molecule's weight is larger than 360 it shows a negative contribution to logBB. The computations of molecular surface, partial charges, logP, and logBB have been accomplished using a program called Drug-BB. Moreover, to improve the efficiency of the computations of logP, we made an extensive reparametrization of SLOGP, and the newly developed SLOGP model is only based on simple atomic addition. Further, we developed a set of parameters to calculate the topological polar surface area (TPSA), thus the high-charged topological polar surface area (HCTPSA) could be estimated from the 2D connection information of a molecule. Adopting the new strategies, the estimations of logP, HCTPSA, and logBB are only based on the topological structure of a molecule and therefore, can be used for fast screening of virtual libraries having millions of molecules.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bba85b5c99eb726141920857ccedab852d9fecb9,Comparison of several logP calculation approaches suggests that logP calculated bySLOGP can be used as a significant descriptor for the prediction of molecular transport properties because SLOGP gives the most similar results with CLOGP.,TJ.

We grouped the models into five sets depending on the interaction types, that is, whether the interactions of two atoms that form the bond, bond angle, and dihedral angle are turned off or scaled down. When 1-2 (bonded) and 1-3 (separated by two bonds) interactions are turned off, 1-4 (separated by three bonds) interactions are scaled down, or both, all models including the Applequist model achieved similar performance: the average percentage error (APE) ranges from 1.15 to 1.23%, and the average unsigned error (AUE) ranges from 0.143 to 0.158 Å(3).

They are complementary to experiment and can often go beyond experiment in atomic details. Even a FF is specific for studying structures, dynamics and functions of biomolecules, it is still important for the FF to accurately reproduce the experimental liquid properties of small molecules that represent the chemical moieties of biomolecules. Otherwise, the force field may not describe the structures and energies of macromolecules in aqueous solutions properly. In this work, we have carried out a systematic study to evaluate the General AMBER Force Field (GAFF) in studying densities and heats of vaporization for a large set of organic molecules that covers the most common chemical functional groups. The latest techniques, such as the particle mesh Ewald (PME) for calculating electrostatic energies, and Langevin dynamics for scaling temperatures, have been applied in the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For density, the average percent error (APE) of 71 organic compounds is 4.43% when compared to the experimental values. More encouragingly, the APE drops to 3.43% after the exclusion of two outliers and four other compounds for which the experimental densities have been measured with pressures higher than 1.0 atm. For heat of vaporization, several protocols have been investigated and the best one, P4/ntt0, achieves an average unsigned error (AUE) and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.93 and 1.20 kcal/mol, respectively. How to reduce the prediction errors through proper van der Waals (vdW) parameterization has been discussed. An encouraging finding in vdW parameterization is that both densities and heats of vaporization approach their ""ideal"" values in a synchronous fashion when vdW parameters are tuned. The following hydration free energy calculation using thermodynamic integration further justifies the vdW refinement. We conclude that simple vdW parameterization can significantly reduce the prediction errors.

Methods: Rather than giving detailed descriptions of the ADME prediction models, we focus on the discussions of the prediction accuracies of the in silico models. Results/conclusion: We find that the robustness and predictive capability of the ADME models are directly associated with the complexity of the ADME property.

In silico models for predicting the percentage of HIA based on calculated molecular descriptors are highly needed for the rapid estimation of this property. Here, we have studied the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) to classify compounds with high or low fractional absorption (%FA > 30% or %FA < or = 30%). The analyzed data set consists of 578 structural diverse druglike molecules, which have been divided into a 480-molecule training set and a 98-molecule test set. Ten SVM classification models have been generated to investigate the impact of different individual molecular properties on %FA. Among these studied important molecule descriptors, topological polar surface area (TPSA) and predicted apparent octanol-water distribution coefficient at pH 6.5 (logD6.5) show better classification performance than the others. To obtain the best SVM classifier, the influences of different kernel functions and different combinations of molecular descriptors were investigated using a rigorous training-validation procedure. The best SVM classifier can give satisfactory predictions for the training set (97.8% for the poor-absorption class and 94.5% for the good-absorption class). Moreover, 100% of the poor-absorption class and 97.8% of the good-absorption class in the external test set could be correctly classified. Finally, the influence of the size of the training set and the unbalanced nature of the data set have been studied. The analysis demonstrates that large data set is necessary for the stability of the classification models. Furthermore, the weights for the poor-absorption class and the good-absorption class should be properly balanced to generate unbiased classification models.

Because of the importance of aqueous solubility, a lot of efforts have been spent on developing reliable models to predict this physiochemical property. Although some progress has been made and a lot of models have been constructed, it is concluded that accurate and reliable aqueous models targeted to predict solubility of drug-like molecules, have not emerged based on the outcome of an aqueous solubility prediction campaign sponsored by Goodman et al. In this review paper, we provide a snapshot of the latest development in the field. The challenges of developing high quality aqueous solubility models as well as the strategies of surmounting those challenges have been discussed. We conclude that the biggest challenge of modeling aqueous solubility is to collect more high quality, unskewed and drug-relevant solubility data which are sufficient diverse to cover most the chemical space of drugs. The second challenge is to develop good descriptors to account for the lattice energy of solvation. In order to develop accurate and predictable in silico solubility models, the key is to collect a sufficient number of high quality experimental data and the suspicious data must be verified.

Recently, the most stable surface structures of CH3NH3PbX3 have been successfully characterized by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with the high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results. The two coexisting phases of the perovskite surfaces have been ascribed to the alternate orientation of the methylammonium (MA) cations. Notably, similar surface defect images (a dark depression at the sites of X atoms) have been observed on surfaces produced with various experimental methods. As such, these defects are expected to be intrinsic to the perovskite crystals and may play an important role in the structural decomposition of perovskite materials. Understanding the nature of such defects should provide some useful information toward understanding the instability of perovskite materials. Thus, we investigate the chemical identity of the surface defects systematically with first-principles density functional theory calculations and STM simulations. The calculated STM images of the Br and Br-MA vacancies are both in good agreement with the experimental measurements. In vacuum conditions, the formation energy of Br-MA is 0.43 eV less than the Br vacancy. In the presence of solvation effects, however, the formation energy of a Br vacancy becomes 0.42 eV lower than the Br-MA vacancy. In addition, at the vacancy sites, the adsorption energies of water, oxygen, and acetonitrile molecules are significantly higher than those on the pristine surfaces. This clearly demonstrated that the structural decomposition of perovskites are much easier to start from these vacancy sites than the pristine surfaces.

Accurate prediction of binding free energy is of particular importance to computational biology and structure-based drug design. Among those methods for binding affinity predictions, the end-point approaches, such as MM/PBSA and LIE, have been widely used because they can achieve a good balance between prediction accuracy and computational cost. Here we present an easy-to-use pipeline tool named Calculation of Free Energy (CaFE) to conduct MM/PBSA and LIE calculations. Powered by the VMD and NAMD programs, CaFE is able to handle numerous static coordinate and molecular dynamics trajectory file formats generated by different molecular simulation packages and supports various force field parameters.

Therefore, the recognition of potential P-gp substrates at the early stages of the drug discovery process is quite important. Here, we compiled an extensive data set containing 423 P-gp substrates and 399 nonsubstrates, which is the largest P-gp substrate/nonsubstrate data set yet published. Comparison of the distributions of eight important physicochemical properties for the substrates and nonsubstrates reveals that molecular weight and molecular solubility are the informative attributes differentiating P-gp substrates from nonsubstrates. Examination of the distributions of eight physicochemical properties for 735 P-gp inhibitors and 423 substrates gives the fact that inhibitors are significantly more hydrophobic than substrates while substrates tend to have more H-bond donors than inhibitors. Then, the classification models based on simple molecular properties, topological descriptors, and molecular fingerprints were developed using the naive Bayesian classification technique.

MM-PBSA (molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area) and MM-GBSA (molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area) have gained popularity in this field. For both methods, the conformational entropy, which is usually calculated through normal-mode analysis (NMA), is needed to calculate the absolute binding free energies. Unfortunately, NMA is computationally demanding and becomes a bottleneck of the MM-PB/GBSA-NMA methods. In this work, we have developed a fast approach to estimate the conformational entropy based upon solvent accessible surface area calculations. In our approach, the conformational entropy of a molecule, S, can be obtained by summing up the contributions of all atoms, no matter they are buried or exposed. Each atom has two types of surface areas, solvent accessible surface area (SAS) and buried SAS (BSAS). The two types of surface areas are weighted to estimate the contribution of an atom to S. Atoms having the same atom type share the same weight and a general parameter k is applied to balance the contributions of the two types of surface areas. This entropy model was parametrized using a large set of small molecules for which their conformational entropies were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level taking the solvent effect into account. The weighted solvent accessible surface area (WSAS) model was extensively evaluated in three tests. For convenience, TS values, the product of temperature T and conformational entropy S, were calculated in those tests. T was always set to 298.15 K through the text. First of all, good correlations were achieved between WSAS TS and NMA TS for 44 protein or nucleic acid systems sampled with molecular dynamics simulations (10 snapshots were collected for postentropy calculations): the mean correlation coefficient squares (R²) was 0.56. As to the 20 complexes, the TS changes upon binding; TΔS values were also calculated, and the mean R² was 0.67 between NMA and WSAS. In the second test, TS values were calculated for 12 proteins decoy sets (each set has 31 conformations) generated by the Rosetta software package. Again, good correlations were achieved for all decoy sets: the mean, maximum, and minimum of R² were 0.73, 0.89, and 0.55, respectively. Finally, binding free energies were calculated for 6 protein systems (the numbers of inhibitors range from 4 to 18) using four scoring functions. Compared to the measured binding free energies, the mean R² of the six protein systems were 0.51, 0.47, 0.40, and 0.43 for MM-GBSA-WSAS, MM-GBSA-NMA, MM-PBSA-WSAS, and MM-PBSA-NMA, respectively. The mean rms errors of prediction were 1.19, 1.24, 1.41, 1.29 kcal/mol for the four scoring functions, correspondingly. Therefore, the two scoring functions employing WSAS achieved a comparable prediction performance to that of the scoring functions using NMA. It should be emphasized that no minimization was performed prior to the WSAS calculation in the last test. Although WSAS is not as rigorous as physical models such as quasi-harmonic analysis and thermodynamic integration (TI), it is computationally very efficient as only surface area calculation is involved and no structural minimization is required. Moreover, WSAS has achieved a comparable performance to normal-mode analysis. We expect that this model could find its applications in the fields like high throughput screening (HTS), molecular docking, and rational protein design. In those fields, efficiency is crucial since there are a large number of compounds, docking poses, or protein models to be evaluated.

The overall performances of different algorithms can be ranked from the best to the worst as follows: rbf-SVM > XGBoost > rbf-GPR > Cubist > GBM > DNN > RF > pca-ANN > MARS > linear-GPR ≈ KNN > linear-SVM ≈ PLSR > CART ≈ PCR ≈ MLR. In terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, SVM and XGBoost are recommended to the regression learning for small data sets, and XGBoost is an excellent choice for large data sets.

Treatment strategies for SCI are required to overcome comprehensive issues. Implantation of biomaterial scaffolds and stem cells has been demonstrated to be a promising strategy. However, a comprehensive recovery effect is difficult to achieve. In the comprehensive treatment process, the specific roles of the implanted scaffolds and of stem cells in combined strategy are usually neglected. In this study, a peptide-modified scaffold is developed based on hyaluronic acid and an adhesive peptide PPFLMLLKGSTR. Synchrotron radiation micro computed tomography measurement provides insights to the three-dimensional inner topographical property and perspective porous structure of the scaffold. The modified scaffold significantly improves cellular survival and adhesive growth of mesenchymal stem cells during 3D culture in vitro. After implantation in transected spinal cord, the modified scaffold and mesenchymal stems are found to function in synergy to restore injured spinal cord tissue, with respective strengths. Hindlimb motor function scores exhibit the most significant impact of the composite implant at 2 weeks post injury, which is the time secondary injury factors begin to take hold. Investigation on the secondary injury factors including inflammatory response and astrocyte overactivity at 10 days post injury reveals the possible underlying reason. Implants of the scaffold, cells, and especially the combination of both elicit inhibitory effects on these adverse factors.

For this purpose, the theoretical models for drug-likeness to discriminate between drug-like and non-drug-like based on molecular physicochemical properties and structural fingerprints were developed by using the naive Bayesian classification (NBC) and recursive partitioning (RP) techniques, and then the drug-likeness of the compounds from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Compound Database (TCMCD) was evaluated. First, the impact of molecular physicochemical properties and structural fingerprints on the prediction accuracy of drug-likeness was examined. We found that, compared with simple molecular properties, structural fingerprints were more essential for the accurate prediction of drug-likeness. Then, a variety of Bayesian classifiers were constructed by changing the ratio of drug-like to non-drug-like molecules and the size of the training set. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy of the Bayesian classifiers was closely related to the size and the degree of the balance of the training set. When a balanced training set was used, the best Bayesian classifier based on 21 physicochemical properties and the LCFP_6 fingerprint set yielded an overall leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validated accuracy of 91.4% for the 140,000 molecules in the training set and 90.9% for the 40,000 molecules in the test set. In addition, the RP classifiers with different maximum depth were constructed and compared with the Bayesian classifiers, and we found that the best Bayesian classifier outperformed the best RP model with respect to overall prediction accuracy. Moreover, the Bayesian classifier employing structural fingerprints highlights the important substructures favorable or unfavorable for drug-likeness, offering extra valuable information for getting high quality lead compounds in the early stage of the drug design/discovery process. Finally, the best Bayesian classifier was used to predict the drug-likeness of 33,961 compounds in TCMCD.

These compounds belonging to six different structural classes were randomly divided into a training set of 122 compounds and a test set of 13 compounds. The statistical results showed that the 3D-QSAR models derived from CoMFA were superior to those generated from CoMSIA. The most optimal CoMFA model after region focusing bears significant cross-validated r(2)(cv) of 0.60 and conventional r(2) of 0.92. The predictive power of the best CoMFA model was further validated by the accurate estimation to these compounds in the external test set, and the mean agreement of experimental and predicted log(IC(50)) values of the inhibitors is 0.6 log unit. Separate CoMFA models were conducted to evaluate the influence of different partial charges (Gasteiger-Marsili, Gasteiger-Hückel, MMFF94, ESP-AM1, and MPA-AM1) on the statistical quality of the models. The resulting CoMFA field map provides information on the geometry of the binding site cavity and the relative weights of various properties in different site pockets for each of the substrates considered. Moreover, in the current work, we applied MD simulations combined with MM/PBSA (Molecular mechanics/Possion-Boltzmann Surface Area) to determine the correct binding mode of the best inhibitor for which no ligand-protein crystal structure was present. To proceed, we define the following procedure: three hundred picosecond molecular dynamics simulations were first performed for the four binding modes suggested by DOCK 4.0 and manual docking, and then MM/PBSA was carried out for the collected snapshots. The most favorable binding mode identified by MM/PBSA has a binding free energy about 10 kcal/mol more favorable than the second best one. The most favorable binding mode identified by MM/PBSA can give satisfactory explanation of the SAR data of the studied molecules and is in good agreement with the contour maps of CoMFA. The most favorable binding mode suggests that with the quinazoline-based inhibitor, the N3 atom is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule which, in turn, interacts with Thr 766, not Thr 830 as proposed by Wissner et al. (J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 3244).

In our docking procedure, surface complementarity and energetic complementarity of a ligand with its receptor have been considered separately in a two-stage docking method. The first stage was to find a set of potential associated sites mainly based on surface complementarity using a genetic algorithm combined with a tabu search. This step corresponds with the process of finding the potential binding sites where pharmacophores will bind. In the second stage, several hundreds of GA minimization steps were performed for each associated site derived from the first stage mainly based on the energetic complementarity. After calculations for both of the two stages, we can offer several solutions of associated sites for every complex. In this paper, seven biomolecular systems, including five bound complexes and two unbound complexes, were chosen from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to test our method. The calculated results were very encouraging-the hybrid minimization algorithm successfully reaches the correct solutions near the best binded modes for these protein complexes. The docking results not only predict the bound complexes very well, but also get a relatively accurate complexed conformation for unbound systems. For the five bound complexes, the results show that surface complementarity is enough to find the precise binding modes, the top solution from the tabu list generally corresponds to the correct binding mode. For the two unbound complexes, due to the conformational changes upon binding, it seems more difficult to get their correct binding conformations. The predicted results show that the correct binding mode also corresponds to a relatively large surface complementarity score. In these two test cases, the correct solution can be found in the top several solutions from the tabu list. For unbound complexes, the interaction energy from energetic complementarity is very important, it can be used to filter these solutions from the surface complementarity. After the evaluation of the energetic complementarity, the conformations and orientations close to the crystallographically determined structures are resolved. In most cases, the smallest root mean square distance (r.m.s.d.) from the GA combined with TA solutions is in a relatively small region.

However, under strong purifying selection, drug resistance usually occurs in the cancer cells within a short term. Many cases of drug resistance have been found to be associated with secondary mutations in drug target, which lead to the attenuated drug-target interactions. For example, recently, an acquired secondary mutation, G2032R, has been detected in the drug target, ROS1 tyrosine kinase, from a crizotinib-resistant patient, who responded poorly to crizotinib within a very short therapeutic term. It was supposed that the mutation was located at the solvent front and might hinder the drug binding. However, a different fact could be uncovered by the simulations reported in this study. Here, free energy surfaces were characterized by the drug-target distance and the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) conformational change of the crizotinib-ROS1 complex through advanced molecular dynamics techniques, and it was revealed that the more rigid P-loop region in the G2032R-mutated ROS1 was primarily responsible for the crizotinib resistance, which on one hand, impaired the binding of crizotinib directly, and on the other hand, shortened the residence time induced by the flattened free energy surface.

The GA optimizations resulted in a group of linear models with three or four molecular descriptors with good statis- tical significance.

Although high response ratio was detected from the patients treated with crizotinib, the cancer has eventually conferred resistance to crizotinib. Several drug resistance mutations have been found in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase domain as the target for crizotinib, but the drug resistance mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, the adaptive biasing force (ABF) method and two-end-state free energy calculation approaches were employed to elucidate the resistance mechanisms of crizotinib induced by the mutations L1152R, G1202R, and S1206Y. The ABF simulation results suggest that the reaction coordinates for the unbinding processes of crizotinib from the binding pockets of the mutated ALKs is different from that of the wild type ALK. The potentials of mean force for the crizotinib unbinding and the binding free energies predicted by the two-end-state free energy calculations are consistent with the experimental data. Our results indicate that the three mutations weaken the binding affinity of crizotinib obviously and lead to drug resistance.

We employed density functional theory and electronic transport calculations to investigate the stabilities, electronic structures and transport properties of borophene nanoribbons. The stability of a borophene nanoribbon increases with its width and only the lined-edged borophene nanoribbons are stable in the free-standing form. Such anisotropic stability dependence is ascribed to the large scale delocalization of π electrons along the boron rows. In particular, all line-edge borophene nanoribbons undergo edge reconstructions, in which the out-of-plane bulking edge atoms are reconstructed to form quasi planar edge structures. Such edge reconstructions have not yet been reported, which is critical for the formation of boron nanostructrues. Subsequent electronic transport calculations based on a non-equilibrium Green’s function indicated that line-edge borophene nanoribbons exhibit low-resistivity Ohmic conductance. Our results indicated that the line-edge borophene nanoribbons present remarkable properties (high thermal stabilities, Ohmic conductance with low electrical resistivity and good rigidities) and are promising for applications as one-dimensional electrical connections in compact nanoscale circuits.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cad9b954957b219c9f207f0768770c4dacb280b9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, precise prediction of resistant viral mutants is particularly useful for developing effective drugs and designing therapeutic regimen. In this study, we applied a structure-based computational approach to predict mutants of the HIV-1 protease resistant to the seven FDA approved drugs. We analyzed the energetic pattern of the protease-drug interaction by calculating the molecular interaction energy components (MIECs) between the drug and the protease residues. Support vector machines (SVMs) were trained on MIECs to classify protease mutants into resistant and nonresistant categories. The high prediction accuracies for the test sets of cross-validations suggested that the MIECs successfully characterized the interaction interface between drugs and the HIV-1 protease. We conducted a proof-of-concept study on a newly approved drug, darunavir (TMC114), on which no drug resistance data were available in the public domain. Compared with amprenavir, our analysis suggested that darunavir might be more potent to combat drug resistance. To quantitatively estimate binding affinities of drugs and study the contributions of protease residues to causing resistance, linear regression models were trained on MIECs using partial least squares (PLS). The MIEC-PLS models also achieved satisfactory prediction accuracy. Analysis of the fitting coefficients of MIECs in the regression model revealed the important resistance mutations and shed light into understanding the mechanisms of these mutations to cause resistance.

In order to gain a deeper insight into the microscopic binding of this inhibitor with ROCK1 and design derivatives with improved potency, the interactions between ROCK1 and a series of triazine/pyrimidine-based inhibitors were studied by using an integrated computational protocol that combines molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding free energy calculations, and binding energy decomposition analysis. First, three docking protocols, rigid receptor docking, induced fit docking, QM-polarized ligand docking, were used to determine the binding modes of the studied inhibitors in the active site of ROCK1. The results illustrate that rigid receptor docking achieves the best performance to rank the binding affinities of the studied inhibitors. Then, based on the predicted structures from molecular docking, MD simulations and MM/GBSA free energy calculations were employed to determine the dynamic binding process and compare the binding modes of the inhibitors with different activities. The binding free energies predicted by MM/GBSA are in good agreement with the experimental bioactivities, and the analysis of the individual energy terms suggests that the van der Waals interaction is the major driving force for ligand binding. In addition, the residue-inhibitor interaction spectra were obtained by the MM/GBSA free energy decomposition analysis, and the important residues for achieving strong binding were highlighted, which affords important guidance for the rational design of novel ROCK inhibitors. Finally, a variety of derivatives of inhibitor 1 were designed and four of them showed promising potency according to the predictions.

Meanwhile, it is a common and traditional issue in occupational and environmental protection. Pharmaceutical and chemical industries have a strong urge to develop precise and convenient computational tools to evaluate the respiratory toxicity of compounds as early as possible. Most of the reported theoretical models were developed based on the respiratory toxicity data sets with one single symptom, such as respiratory sensitization, and therefore these models may not afford reliable predictions for toxic compounds with other respiratory symptoms, such as pneumonia or rhinitis. Here, based on a diverse data set of mouse intraperitoneal respiratory toxicity characterized by multiple symptoms, a number of quantitative and qualitative predictions models with high reliability were developed by machine learning approaches. First, a four-tier dimension reduction strategy was employed to find an optimal set of 20 molecular descriptors for model building. Then, six machine learning approaches were used to develop the prediction models, including relevance vector machine (RVM), support vector machine (SVM), regularized random forest (RRF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), naïve Bayes (NB), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Among all of the models, the SVM regression model shows the most accurate quantitative predictions for the test set (q2ext = 0.707), and the XGBoost classification model achieves the most accurate qualitative predictions for the test set (MCC of 0.644, AUC of 0.893, and global accuracy of 82.62%).

In fastDRH server, AutoDock Vina and AutoDock-GPU docking engines, structure-truncated MM/PB(GB)SA free energy calculation procedures and multiple poses based per-residue energy decomposition analysis were well integrated into a user-friendly and multifunctional online platform. Benefit from the modular architecture, users can flexibly use one or more of three features, including molecular docking, docking pose rescoring and hotspot residue prediction, to obtain the key information clearly based on a result analysis panel supported by 3Dmol.js and Apache ECharts. In terms of protein-ligand binding mode prediction, the integrated structure-truncated MM/PB(GB)SA rescoring procedures exhibit a success rate of >80% in benchmark, which is much better than the AutoDock Vina (~70%). For hotspot residue identification, our multiple poses based per-residue energy decomposition analysis strategy is a more reliable solution than the one using only a single pose, and the performance of our solution has been experimentally validated in several drug discovery projects.

It is more likely that drug-resistant influenza strains will arise after the extensive use of anti-influenza drugs. Consequently, the identification of the potential resistant sites for drugs in advance and the understanding of the corresponding molecular mechanisms that cause drug resistance are quite important in the design of new drug candidates with better potency to combat drug resistance. Here, we performed molecular simulations to evaluate the potency of oseltamivir to combat drug resistance caused by the mutations in 2009 A/H1N1 neuraminidase (NA). We examined three representative drug-resistant mutations in NA, consisting of H274Y, N294S, and Y252H. First, a theoretical structure of A/H1N1 NA in complex with oseltamivir was constructed using homology modeling. Then, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculations, and MM/GBSA free energy decomposition were used to characterize the binding of oseltamivir with the wild type (WT) and three mutated NAs. Our predictions show that N294S and H274Y, two popular drug-resistant mutations in different variants of NA, still cause significant resistance to oseltamivir. However, the Y252H mutation does not impair the interactions between oseltamivir and A/H1N1 NA. An examination of individual energy components shows that the loss of polar interactions is the key source for the resistance of the studied mutations to oseltamivir. Moreover, free energy decomposition analysis and structural analysis reveal that the N294S or H274Y mutation triggers the large-scale conformational changes of the binding pocket and then impairs the affinity of oseltamivir. We expect that our results will be useful for the rational design of NA inhibitors with high potency against drug-resistant A/H1N1 mutants.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fd311cb5f7834eaa3e9848b57c507ededd530360,"Molecular simulations show that N294S and H274Y, two popular drug-resistant mutations in different variants of NA, still cause significant resistance to oseltamivir, and the results will be useful for the rational design of NA inhibitors with high potency against drug- resistant A/H1N1 mutants.",L.

However, due to the relatively 'undruggable' features of PPI interfaces, accurate predictions of the binding structures for ligands towards PPI targets are quite challenging for most docking algorithms. Here, we constructed a non-redundant pose ranking benchmark dataset for small-molecule PPI inhibitors, which contains 900 binding poses for 184 protein-ligand complexes. Then, we evaluated the performance of MM/PB(GB)SA approaches to identify the correct binding poses for PPI inhibitors, including two Prime MM/GBSA procedures from the Schrödinger suite and seven different MM/PB(GB)SA procedures from the Amber package. Our results showed that MM/PBSA outperformed the Glide SP scoring function (success rate of 58.6%) and MM/GBSA in most cases, especially the PB3 procedure which could achieve an overall success rate of ∼74%. Moreover, the GB6 procedure (success rate of 68.9%) performed much better than the other MM/GBSA procedures, highlighting the excellent potential of the GBNSR6 implicit solvation model for pose ranking.

In this study, to better recognize the potential of classical SFs, we have conducted a comparative assessment of 25 commonly used SFs.

The prediction of BCRP inhibition can facilitate evaluating potential drug resistance and drug-drug interactions in early stage of drug discovery. Here we reported a structurally diverse dataset consisting of 1098 BCRP inhibitors and 1701 non-inhibitors. Analysis of various physicochemical properties illustrates that BCRP inhibitors are more hydrophobic and aromatic than non-inhibitors. We then developed a series of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to discriminate between BCRP inhibitors and non-inhibitors. The optimal feature subset was determined by a wrapper feature selection method named rfSA (simulated annealing algorithm coupled with random forest), and the classification models were established by using seven machine learning approaches based on the optimal feature subset, including a deep learning method, two ensemble learning methods, and four classical machine learning methods. The statistical results demonstrated that three methods, including support vector machine (SVM), deep neural networks (DNN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), outperformed the others, and the SVM classifier yielded the best predictions (MCC = 0.812 and AUC = 0.958 for the test set). Then, a perturbation-based model-agnostic method was used to interpret our models and analyze the representative features for different models. The application domain analysis demonstrated the prediction reliability of our models. Moreover, the important structural fragments related to BCRP inhibition were identified by the information gain (IG) method along with the frequency analysis.

Although this feature has been widely used in organometallics to develop homogeneous catalysts, a single-atom heterogeneous analogue has not yet been reported. In this work, we show that a 16-electron complex may act as an important transition state in the CO oxidation over a single Pt atom supported by a MoS2 monolayer (Pt/MoS2). The catalytic oxidation reaction prefers to start with the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) reaction, where the CO and O2 molecules are first co-adsorbed on the Pt atom, then cross a small barrier of 0.40 eV to form a square-planar 16-electron intermediate state, and subsequently the first CO2 is released. The activation barrier of the following Eley–Rideal (E–R) reaction is only 0.23 eV. The superior catalytic reactivity of the Pt/MoS2 surface can be explained by the quantum confinement effect of the Pt-5d orbitals and the stability of the square-planar 16-electron transition state. In addition, MoS2 may serve as a defect-free two dimensional anchoring substrate for Pt atomic adsorption. It provides not only a very large surface-to-volume ratio, but also a well-defined structure with a uniform distribution of anchoring points. The square-planar 16-electron intermediate state of the L–H reaction, together with the new MoS2 anchoring substrate, may provide a new opportunity for the design of single-atom catalysts on two-dimensional surfaces.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1cdebbe17be0a302b98c1f492a935766512d7277,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human neutrophil peptides 1-3 (HNP1-3) are the most abundant neutrophil granule proteins but their neutrophil content varies because of unusually extensive gene copy number polymorphism. A genetic association study found that increased copy number of the HNP-encoding gene DEFA1/DEFA3 is a risk factor for organ dysfunction during sepsis development. However, direct experimental evidence demonstrating that these risk alleles are pathogenic for sepsis is lacking because the genes are present only in some primates and humans. Here, we generate DEFA1/DEFA3 transgenic mice with neutrophil-specific expression of the peptides. We show that mice with high copy number of DEFA1/DEFA3 genes have more severe sepsis-related vital organ damage and mortality than mice with low copy number of DEFA1/DEFA3 or wild-type mice, resulting from more severe endothelial barrier dysfunction and endothelial cell pyroptosis after sepsis challenge. Mechanistically, HNP-1 induces endothelial cell pyroptosis via P2X7 receptor-mediating canonical caspase-1 activation in a NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent manner. Based on these findings, we engineered a monoclonal antibody against HNP-1 to block the interaction with P2X7 and found that the blocking antibody protected mice carrying high copy number of DEFA1/DEFA3 from lethal sepsis.

First, based on the solvation free energies predicted by the Generalized Born model for ~ 800 proteins, a SASA (solvent accessible surface area)-based solvation model was developed, which can give the aqueous solvation free energies for proteins by summing the contributions of 21 atom types. Then, the van der Waals potentials and electrostatic potentials based on the Amber ff14SB force field were computed. Finally, the HawkRank scoring function was derived by determining the most optimal weights for five energy terms based on the training set. Here, MSR (modified success rate), a novel protein-protein scoring quality index, was used to assess the performance of HawkRank and three other popular protein-protein scoring functions, including ZRANK, FireDock and dDFIRE. The results show that HawkRank outperformed the other three scoring functions according to the total number of hits and MSR.

Previous works usually generate atoms in an auto-regressive way, where element types and 3D coordinates of atoms are generated one by one. However, in real-world molecular systems, the interactions among atoms in an entire molecule are global, leading to the energy function pair-coupled among atoms. With such energy-based consideration, the modeling of probability should be based on joint distributions, rather than sequentially conditional ones. Thus, the unnatural sequentially auto-regressive modeling of molecule generation is likely to violate the physical rules, thus resulting in poor properties of the generated molecules. In this work, a generative diffusion model for molecular 3D structures based on target proteins as contextual constraints is established, at a full-atom level in a non-autoregressive way. Given a designated 3D protein binding site, our model learns the generative process that denoises both element types and 3D coordinates of an entire molecule, with an equivariant network. Experimentally, the proposed method shows competitive performance compared with prevailing works in terms of high affinity with proteins and appropriate molecule sizes as well as other drug properties such as drug-likeness of the generated molecules.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/84e07c84a411ec5ed0828049d777b9cb8129c14d,"A generative diffusion model for molecular 3D structures based on target proteins as contextual constraints is established, at a full-atom level in a non-autoregressive way, which shows competitive performance compared with prevailing works in terms of high affinity with proteins and appropriate molecule sizes as well as other drug properties such as drug-likeness of the generated molecules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most existing explanation methods for GNNs in chemistry focus on attributing model predictions to individual nodes, edges or fragments that are not necessarily derived from a chemically meaningful segmentation of molecules. To address this challenge, we propose a method named substructure mask explanation (SME). SME is based on well-established molecular segmentation methods and provides an interpretation that aligns with the understanding of chemists. We apply SME to elucidate how GNNs learn to predict aqueous solubility, genotoxicity, cardiotoxicity and blood-brain barrier permeation for small molecules. SME provides interpretation that is consistent with the understanding of chemists, alerts them to unreliable performance, and guides them in structural optimization for target properties. Hence, we believe that SME empowers chemists to confidently mine structure-activity relationship (SAR) from reliable GNNs through a transparent inspection on how GNNs pick up useful signals when learning from data.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ee75d0675c7adedded789e38500cc0b32b9fb4ae,It is believed that SME empowers chemists to confidently mine structure-activity relationship (SAR) from reliable GNNs through a transparent inspection on how GNN's pick up useful signals when learning from data.,Z.

To answer this question, we analyzed the important physicochemical properties, structural features, and drug-likeness of the two types of natural products and discussed their differences from the perspective of evolution. In general, MNPs have lower solubility and are often larger than TNPs. On average, particularly from the perspective of unique fragments and scaffolds, MNPs usually possess more long chains and large rings, especially 8- to 10-membered rings. MNPs also have more nitrogen atoms and halogens, notably bromines, and fewer oxygen atoms, suggesting that MNPs may be synthesized by more diverse biosynthetic pathways than TNPs. Analysis of the frequently occurring Murcko frameworks in MNPs and TNPS also reveals a striking difference between MNPs and TNPs. The scaffolds of the former tend to be longer and often contain ester bonds connected to 10-membered rings, while the scaffolds of the latter tend to be shorter and often bear more stable ring systems and bond types. Besides, the prediction from the naïve Bayesian drug-likeness classification model suggests that most compounds in MNPs and TNPs are drug-like, although MNPs are slightly more drug-like than TNPs.

However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are still largely elusive. Here we show that the IL-6/STAT3 inflammatory signaling axis induces the deacetylation of FRA1 at the Lys-116 residue located within its DNA-binding domain. The HDAC6 deacetylase underlies this key modification leading to the increase of FRA1 transcriptional activity, the subsequent transactivation of NANOG expression, and the acquisition of stem-like cellular features. As validated in a large (n = 123) CRC cohort, IL-6 secretion was invariably accompanied by increased FRA1 deacetylation at K116 and an overall increase in its protein levels, coincident with malignant progression and poor prognosis. Of note, combined treatment with the conventional cytotoxic drug 5-FU together with Tubastatin A, a HDAC6-specific inhibitor, resulted in a significant in vivo synergistic inhibitory effect on tumor growth through suppression of CRC stemness. Our results reveal a novel transcriptional and posttranslational regulatory cross-talk between inflammation and stemness signaling pathways that underlie self-renewal and maintenance of CRC stem cells and promote their malignant behavior.

Current computational approaches aiming to filter out aggregated molecules based on their similarity to known aggregators, such as Aggregator Advisor, have low prediction accuracy, and therefore development of reliable in silico models to detect aggregators is highly desirable. In this study, we built a data set consisting of 12 119 aggregators and 24 172 drugs or drug candidates and then developed a group of classification models based on the combination of two ensemble learning approaches and five types of molecular representations. The best model yielded an accuracy of 0.950 and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.987 for the training set, and an accuracy of 0.937 and an AUC of 0.976 for the test set. The best model also gave reliable predictions to the external validation set with 5681 aggregators since 80% of molecules were predicted to be aggregators with a prediction probability higher than 0.9. More importantly, we explored the relationship between colloidal aggregation and molecular features, and generalized a set of simple rules to detect aggregators. Molecular features, such as log D, the number of hydroxyl groups, the number of aromatic carbons attached to a hydrogen atom, and the number of sulfur atoms in aromatic heterocycles, would be helpful to distinguish aggregators from nonaggregators. A comparison with numerous existing druglikeness and aggregation filtering rules and models used in virtual screening verified the high reliability of the model and rules proposed in this study. We also used the model to screen several curated chemical databases, and almost 20% of molecules in the evaluated databases were predicted as aggregators, highlighting the potential high risk of aggregation in screening.

The interaction between CXCR4 and its natural ligand CXCL12/stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) plays important roles in cancer metastasis, HIV-1 infection, and inflammatory diseases. Therefore, investigating the CXCR4-CXCL12 interaction is critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the modulation of chemokine-receptor functions and designing new pharmaceutical agents to target the CXCR4-CXCL12 pathway.

The predicted CXCR4-CXCL12 binding pattern is in good agreement with the experimental data. Analysis of the binding structure reveals an obvious electrostatic complementarity between CXCR4 and CXCL12. Moreover, significant conformational rearrangements were observed during the 50 ns MD simulations. In particular, the basic Lys1 at the CXCL12 N-terminus, an essential residue in receptor activation, forms a strong polar interaction with the Glu32 in the CXCR4 extracellular region. It facilitates the significant movement of TM5 and TM6 in the conformational transition, which is coupled to the association with the intracellular signal transduction pathways via heterotrimer G-protein.

The method, SLOGP v1.0, estimates the log P values by summing the contribution of atom-weighted solvent accessible surface areas (SASA) and correction factors. Altogether 100 atom/group types were used to classify atoms with different chemical environments, and two correlation factors were used to consider the intermolecular hydrophobic interactions and intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Coefficient values for 100 atom/group and two correction factors have been derived from a training set of 1850 compounds. The parametrization procedure for different kinds of atoms was performed as follows: first, the atoms in a molecule were defined to different atom/group types based on SMARTS language, and the correction factors were determined by substructure searching; then, SASA for each atom/group type was calculated and added; finally, multivariate linear regression analysis was applied to optimize the hydrophobic parameters for different atom/group types and correction factors in order to reproduce the experimental log P. The correlation based on the training set gives a model with the correlation coefficient (r) of 0.988, the standard deviation (SD) of 0.368 log units, and the absolute unsigned mean error of 0.261. Comparison of various procedures of log P calculations for the external test set of 138 organic compounds demonstrates that our method bears very good accuracy and is comparable or even better than the fragment-based approaches. Moreover, the atom-additive approach based on SASA was compared with the simple atom-additive approach based on the number of atoms. The calculated results show that the atom-additive approach based on SASA gives better predictions than the simple atom-additive one.

After more than five decades of continuing developments, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods have been established as indispensable tools that facilitate fast, reliable and affordable assessments of physicochemical and biological properties of compounds in drug-discovery programs. Currently, there are mainly two types of QSAR methods, descriptor-based methods and graph-based methods. The former is developed based on predefined molecular descriptors, whereas the latter is developed based on simple atomic and bond information. In this study, we presented a simple but highly efficient modeling method by combining molecular graphs and molecular descriptors as the input of a modified graph neural network, called hyperbolic relational graph convolution network plus (HRGCN+). The evaluation results show that HRGCN+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 drug-discovery-related datasets. We also explored the impact of the addition of traditional molecular descriptors on the predictions of graph-based methods, and found that the addition of molecular descriptors can indeed boost the predictive power of graph-based methods. The results also highlight the strong anti-noise capability of our method.

Here, we show the great potential of pre-training in promoting the predictions of important pharmaceutical properties. By utilizing three pre-training tasks based on atom feature prediction, molecular feature prediction and contrastive learning, a new pre-training method K-BERT, which can extract chemical information from SMILES like chemists, was developed.

Moreover, the general fingerprints K-BERT-FP generated by K-BERT exhibit comparative predictive power to MACCS on 15 pharmaceutical datasets and can also capture molecular size and chirality information that traditional binary fingerprints cannot capture.

First, the prediction capabilities of molecular docking and pharmacophore mapping to distinguish inhibitors from noninhibitors for the selected T2DM-related targets were evaluated. The results show that molecular docking or pharmacophore mapping can give satisfactory predictions for most targets but the validations are still quite necessary because the prediction accuracies of these two methods are variable across different targets. Then, the Bayesian classifiers by integrating the predictions from molecular docking and pharmacophore mapping were developed, and the well-validated Bayesian classifiers for 15 targets were utilized to find the potential inhibitors from TCM and establish the compound-target interaction network. The analysis of the compound-target network demonstrates that a small portion (18.6%) of the predicted inhibitors can interact with multitargets. The pharmacological activities for some potential inhibitors have been experimentally confirmed, highlighting the reliability of the Bayesian classifiers. Besides, it is interesting to find that a considerable number of the predicted multitarget inhibitors have free radical scavenging/antioxidant activities, which are closely related to T2DM.

Binding of ligands to AR triggers the conformational changes in AR that may affect the recruitment of coactivators and downstream response of AR signaling pathway. Therefore, AR ligands have great potential to treat these diseases. In this study, we searched for novel AR ligands by performing a docking-based virtual screening (VS) on the basis of the crystal structure of the AR ligand binding domain (LBD) in complex with its agonist. A total of 58 structurally diverse compounds were selected and subjected to LBD affinity assay, with five of them (HBP1-3, HBP1-17, HBP1-38, HBP1-51, and HBP1-58) exhibiting strong binding to AR-LBD. The IC50 values of HBP1-51 and HBP1-58 are 3.96 µM and 4.92 µM, respectively, which are even lower than that of enzalutamide (Enz, IC50 = 13.87 µM), a marketed second-generation AR antagonist. Further bioactivity assays suggest that HBP1-51 is an AR agonist, whereas HBP1-58 is an AR antagonist. In addition, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and principal components analysis (PCA) were carried out to reveal the binding principle of the newly-identified AR ligands toward AR.

In this work, the effects of the ligand binding on the AR-coactivator communications were explored by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results showed that the ligand binding regulates the residue interactions in the function site AF-2. The ligand-to-coactivator allosteric pathway, which involves the coactivator, helix 3 (H3), helix 4 (H4), the loop between H3 and H4 (L3), and helix 12 (H12), and ligands, was characterized.

Because paclitaxel is metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, the possibility of drug-drug interactions mediated by enzyme inhibition may exist between the combining agents. In the present study, a total of 12 kinase inhibitors were evaluated for inhibitory potency in human liver microsomes by monitoring the formation of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 metabolites simultaneously. For reversible inhibition, nilotinib was found to be the most potent inhibitor against both CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and the inhibition potency could be explained by strong hydrogen binding based on molecular docking simulations and type II binding based on spectral analysis. Comparison of K(i) values revealed that the CYP2C8 pathway was more sensitive toward some kinase inhibitors (such as axitinib), while the CYP3A4 pathway was preferentially inhibited by others (such as bosutinib). Pathway-dependent inactivation (time-dependent inhibition) was also observed for a number of kinase inhibitors against CYP3A4 but not CYP2C8. Further studies showed that axitinib had a K(I) of 0.93 μM and k(inact) of 0.0137 min(-1), and the observed inactivation toward CYP3A4 was probably due to the formation of reactive intermediate(s).

In this study, to benchmark the performance of target-specific MLSFs on a relatively unbiased dataset, the MLSFs trained from three representative protein-ligand interaction representations were assessed on the LIT-PCBA dataset, and the classical Glide SP SF and three types of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were also utilized for comparison. Two major aspects in virtual screening campaigns, including prediction accuracy and hit novelty, were systematically explored. The calculation results illustrate that the tested target-specific MLSFs yielded generally superior performance over the classical Glide SP SF, but they could hardly outperform the 2D fingerprint-based QSAR models. Although substantial improvements could be achieved by integrating multiple types of protein-ligand interaction features, the MLSFs were still not sufficient to exceed MACCS-based QSAR models. In terms of the correlations between the hit ranks or the structures of the top-ranked hits, the MLSFs developed by different featurization strategies would have the ability to identify quite different hits. Nevertheless, it seems that target-specific MLSFs do not have the intrinsic attributes of a traditional SF and may not be a substitute for classical SFs.

Great progress has been made in studies on the pharmacology and structure of AR, but the atomic level mechanism of the bidirectional communications between the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) and the activation function-2 (AF2) region of AR remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations were carried out to explore the interactions among water, agonist (DHT) or antagonist (HFT), AR, and coactivator (SRC3). Upon the binding of an agonist (DHT) or antagonist (HFT), the LBP structure would transform to the agonistic or antagonistic state, and the conformational changes of the LBP would regulate the structure of the AF2 surface. As a result, the binding of the androgen DHT could promote the recruitment of the coactivator SRC3 to the AF2, and on the contrary, the binding of the antagonist HFT would induce a perturbation to the shape of the AF2 and then weaken its accommodating capability of the coactivators with the LXXLL motif. The simulation results illustrated that the DHT-AR binding affinity was enhanced by the association of the coactivator SRC3, which would reduce the conformational fluctuation of the AR-LBD and expand the size of the AR LBP.

Great success has been achieved in developing inhibitors targeting the HCV NS3/4A protease over the past decade, but the rapid emergence of drug resistant mutations greatly compromises the efficacy of antiviral drugs or drug candidates. According to the substrate envelope hypothesis (Romano et al., 2010), severe drug resistant mutations would always occur where the inhibitors protrude from the substrate envelope, defined as a consensus volume occupied by the viral substrates in the active site of the NS3/4A protease. However, the substrate envelope hypothesis just qualitatively assesses the impact of mutations to a specific inhibitor, but no quantitative data is obtained. To remedy the weakness, the dynamic binding patterns of HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors or substrates were investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and continuum solvation binding affinity predictions in this study. By comparing the quantitative binding profiles between the substrates and inhibitors, derived from the free energy decomposition analysis, we observed most residues involved in drug resistance form stronger interactions with the inhibitors than with the substrates, which is roughly coincident with the substrate envelope hypothesis and supports the general mechanism of drug resistance: the critical resistant mutations impair more to the binding of inhibitors than that of substrates. Furthermore, our predictions illustrate that the natural substrates of NS3/4A form balanced interactions with the strands 135-139 and 154-160 whereas the inhibitors cannot. Therefore, to overcome drug resistance, it may be necessary to restore the interaction balance between the two strands and the drug candidates.

Two different kinds of alignment techniques including field-fit alignment and atom-by-atom fits were used to produce the molecular aggregate. The results indicated that those two alignment rules generated comparative 3D-QSAR models with similar statistical significance. However, from the predictive ability of the test set, the models from the alignment after maximal steric and electrostatic optimization were slightly better than those from the simple atom-by-atom fits.

Recently, the crystal structures of AcrB bound to the high-molecular-mass drugs rifampicin and erythromycin were reported. Here we performed 20 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the AcrB-rifampicin-minocycline complex in a lipid bilayer and explicit water. We found that the bound drugs, rifampicin and erythromycin, made a unidirectional peristaltic movement towards the extrusion funnel of ToIC, which was facilitated by the water efflux in the channel of AcrB. With a shift of the Phe-617 loop, rifampicin in the access monomer moved towards the entrance of the distal binding pocket. Minocycline in the binding monomer moved from the distal binding pocket towards the gate of the central funnel. The channel between the entrance and the gate made a concerted opening during the MD simulations, which was helpful for the peristaltic movement.

Further investigation showed that pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with MBPTA significantly suppressed MPP(+)-induced cell death by restoring abnormal changes in nuclear morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential, and numerous apoptotic regulators. MBPTA was able to inhibit MPP(+)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)/NO generation, overexpression of inducible NO synthase, and activation of NF-κB, indicating the critical role of MBPTA in regulating ROS/NO-mediated cell death. Furthermore, MBPTA was shown to activate PI3K/Akt survival signaling, and its cytoprotective effect was abolished by PI3K and Akt inhibitors. The structural comparison of a series of MBPTA analogs revealed that the benzofuran moiety probably plays a crucial role in the anti-oxidative stress action.

Traditional feature-engineering approaches heavily rely on handcrafted descriptors and/or fingerprints, which need extensive human expert knowledge. With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence technology, data-driven deep learning methods have shown unparalleled advantages over feature-engineering-based methods. However, existing deep learning methods usually suffer from the scarcity of labeled data and the inability to share information between different tasks when applied to predicting molecular properties, thus resulting in poor generalization capability. Here, we proposed a novel multitask learning BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer) framework, named MTL-BERT, which leverages large-scale pre-training, multitask learning, and SMILES (simplified molecular input line entry specification) enumeration to alleviate the data scarcity problem. MTL-BERT first exploits a large amount of unlabeled data through self-supervised pretraining to mine the rich contextual information in SMILES strings and then fine-tunes the pretrained model for multiple downstream tasks simultaneously by leveraging their shared information. Meanwhile, SMILES enumeration is used as a data enhancement strategy during the pretraining, fine-tuning, and test phases to substantially increase data diversity and help to learn the key relevant patterns from complex SMILES strings. The experimental results showed that the pretrained MTL-BERT model with few additional fine-tuning can achieve much better performance than the state-of-the-art methods on most of the 60 practical molecular datasets. Additionally, the MTL-BERT model leverages attention mechanisms to focus on SMILES character features essential to target properties for model interpretability.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/35f8dfadd490688e7b50797dacd90cd12ca92485,"A novel multitask learning BERT BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer) framework, named MTL-BERT, which leverages large-scale pre-training, multitasks learning, and SMILES enumeration to alleviate the data scarcity problem.",XC.

In this study, based on 532 structurally diverse compounds, we present a comprehensive analysis with the aim to build accurate classification models for distinguishing PXR activators from nonactivators by using a naive Bayesian classification technique. First, the distributions of eight important molecular physicochemical properties of PXR activators versus nonactivators were compared, illustrating that the hydrophobicity-related molecular descriptors (AlogP and log D) show slightly better capability to discriminate PXR activators from nonactivators than the others. Then, based on molecular physicochemical properties, VolSurf descriptors, and molecular fingerprints, naive Bayesian classifiers were developed to separate PXR activators from nonactivators. The results demonstrate that the introduction of molecular fingerprints is quite essential to enhance the prediction accuracy of the classifiers. The best Bayesian classifier based on the 21 physicochemical properties, VolSurf descriptors, and LCFC_10 fingerprints descriptors yields a prediction accuracy of 92.7% for the training set based on leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation and of 85.2% for the test set. Moreover, by exploring the important structural fragments derived from the best Bayesian classifier, we observed that flexibility is an important structural pattern for PXR activation. In addition, chemical compounds containing more halogen atoms, unsaturated alkanes chains relevant to π-π stacking, and fewer nitrogen atoms tend to be PXR activators.

The double P-doped MoS2 (2P-MoS2) is calculated to be more stable than the single P-doped MoS2 (P-MoS2), and the configuration with two P atoms in neighboring sites exhibits the highest stability. The surface of P-doped MoS2 is found highly active for dissociation of O2.

Selecting an optimal screening library for a specific VS campaign is quite important to improve the success rates and avoid wasting resources in later experimental phases. Analysis of the structural features and molecular diversity for different screening libraries can provide valuable information to the decision making process when selecting screening libraries for VS. In this study, the structural features and scaffold diversity of eleven purchasable screening libraries and Traditional Chinese Medicine Compound Database (TCMCD) were analyzed and compared. Their scaffold diversity represented by the Murcko frameworks and Level 1 scaffolds was characterized by the scaffold counts and cumulative scaffold frequency plots, and visualized by Tree Maps and SAR Maps. The analysis demonstrates that, based on the standardized subsets with similar molecular weight distributions, Chembridge, ChemicalBlock, Mucle, TCMCD and VitasM are more structurally diverse than the others. Compared with all purchasable screening libraries, TCMCD has the highest structural complexity indeed but more conservative molecular scaffolds. Moreover, we found that some representative scaffolds were important components of drug candidates against different drug targets, such as kinases and guanosine-binding protein coupled receptors, and therefore the molecules containing pharmacologically important scaffolds found in screening libraries might be potential inhibitors against the relevant targets.

Traditional feature-engineering approaches heavily rely on expert knowledge to devise useful features, which could be costly and sometimes biased. The emerging deep learning (DL) methods deliver a data-driven method to automatically learn expressive representations from complex raw data. Inspired by this, researchers have attempted to apply various deep neural network models to simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES) strings, which contain all the composition and structure information of molecules. However, current models usually suffer from the scarcity of labeled data. This results in a low generalization ability of SMILES-based DL models, which prevents them from competing with the state-of-the-art computational methods. In this study, we utilized the BiLSTM (bidirectional long short term merory) attention network (BAN) in which we employed a novel multi-step attention mechanism to facilitate the extracting of key features from the SMILES strings. Meanwhile, SMILES enumeration was utilized as a data augmentation method in the training phase to substantially increase the number of labeled data and enlarge the probability of mining more patterns from complex SMILES. We again took advantage of SMILES enumeration in the prediction phase to rectify model prediction bias and provide a more accurate prediction.

Therefore, computational techniques, such as homology modeling, have been widely used to produce the theoretical structures of various GPCRs for structure-based drug design (SBDD). Due to the low sequence similarity shared by the transmembrane domains of GPCRs, accurate prediction of GPCR structures by homology modeling is quite challenging. In this study, angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) was taken as a typical case to assess the reliability of class A GPCR homology models for SBDD. Four homology models of angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) at the inactive state were built based on the crystal structures of CXCR4 chemokine receptor, CCR5 chemokine receptor, and δ-opioid receptor, and refined through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and induced-fit docking, to allow for backbone and side-chain flexibility. Then, the quality of the homology models was assessed relative to the crystal structures in terms of two criteria commonly used in SBDD: prediction accuracy of ligand-binding poses and screening power of docking-based virtual screening. It was found that the crystal structures outperformed the homology models prior to any refinement in both assessments. MD simulations could generally improve the docking results for both the crystal structures and homology models. Moreover, the optimized homology model refined by MD simulations and induced-fit docking even shows a similar performance of the docking assessment to the crystal structures.

In this study, we proposed a data-driven interpretable prediction framework called GASA (Graph Attention-based assessment of Synthetic Accessibility) to evaluate the synthetic accessibility of small molecules by distinguishing compounds to be easy- (ES) or hard-to-synthesize (HS).

The sampling around the hypothetical classification boundary was used to improve the ability of GASA to distinguish structurally similar molecules.

Our analysis demonstrates that GASA achieved remarkable performance in distinguishing similar molecules compared with other methods and had a broader applicability domain.

In this study, based on a cross-docking dataset dedicatedly constructed from the PDBbind database, we developed several XGBoost-trained classifiers to discriminate the near-native binding poses from decoys, and systematically assessed their performance with/without the involvement of the cross-docked poses in the training/test sets. The calculation results illustrate that using Extended Connectivity Interaction Features (ECIF), Vina energy terms and docking pose ranks as the features can achieve the best performance, according to the validation through the random splitting or refined-core splitting and the testing on the re-docked or cross-docked poses. Besides, it is found that, despite the significant decrease of the performance for the threefold clustered cross-validation, the inclusion of the Vina energy terms can effectively ensure the lower limit of the performance of the models and thus improve their generalization capability.

However, the emergence of new human influenza virus mutant strains resistant to existing antiviral drugs has been becoming a major challenge. Therefore, it is critical to uncover the mechanisms of drug resistance and seek alternative treatments to combat drug resistance. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) were applied to investigate the different sensitivities of oseltamivir (OTV), zanamivir (ZNV), and peramivir (PRV) against the E119G mutant of 2009 A/H1N1 neuraminidase. The predicted binding free energies indicate that the E119G mutation in NA confers resistance to all of the three studied inhibitors. The ordering of the level of drug resistance predicted by the binding free energies for the three inhibitors is ZNV>PRV>OTV, which agrees well with the experimental data. Drug resistance arises primarily from the unfavorable shifts of the polar interactions between NA and the inhibitors. It comes as a surprise that the mutation of Glu119 that can form strong H-bonds with the inhibitors in the wild-type protein does not have direct impact on the binding affinities of both OTV and PRV due to the regulation of the strong unfavorable polar desolvation energies. The indirectly conformational variations of the inhibitors, which caused by the E119G mutation, are responsible for the loss of the binding free energies.

Firefly luciferase is commonly used as a reporter to monitor the effect of chemical compounds on the activity of a specific target or pathway in HTS. However, the false positive rate of luciferase-based HTS is relatively high because many artifacts or promiscuous compounds that have direct interaction with the luciferase reporter enzyme are usually identified as active compounds (hits). Therefore, it is necessary to develop a rapid screening method to identify these compounds that can inhibit the luciferase activity directly. In this study, a virtual screening (VS) classification model called MIEC-GBDT (MIEC: Molecular Interaction Energy Components; GBDT: Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) was developed to distinguish luciferase inhibitors from non-inhibitors. The MIECs calculated by Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) free energy decomposition were used to energetically characterize the binding pattern of each small molecule at the active site of luciferase, and then the GBDT algorithm was employed to construct the classifiers based on MIECs. The predictions to the test set show that the optimized MIEC-GBDT model outperformed molecular docking and MM/GBSA rescoring. The best MIEC-GBDT model based on the MIECs with the energy terms of ΔGele, ΔGvdW, ΔGGB, and ΔGSA achieves the prediction accuracies of 87.2% and 90.3% for the inhibitors and non-inhibitors in the test sets, respectively. Moreover, the energetic analysis of the vital residues suggests that the energetic contributions of the vital residues to the binding of inhibitors are quite different from those to the binding of non-inhibitors.

Recently, MIF was identified as a non-canonical ligand of G protein-coupled chemokine receptor CXCR2 with low nanomolar affinity in leukocyte arrest and chemotaxis, but the precise knowledge of the molecular determinants of the MIF-CXCR2 interface has remained unknown. Therefore, we employed homology modeling, protein-protein docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy calculations and MM/GBSA binding free energy decomposition to obtain insights into the molecular recognition of MIF with CXCR2. The predicted binding pattern of MIF-CXCR2 is in good agreement with the experimental data and sheds light on the functional role of important MIF-CXCR2 interface residues in association with binding and signaling. According to our predictions, the R11A/D44A double mutations of MIF exhibit a pronounced defect in the binding affinity of MIF to CXCR2, resulting in large conformational changes. The potential two-site binding model for the MIF-CXCR2 recognition was proposed: initialized primarily by the non-polar interactions including the van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions, the N-terminal region of CXCR2 contacts the N-like loop and β-sheet of MIF (site 1), and then the ECL2 and ECL3 regions of CXCR2 form strong interactions with the pseudo-(E)LR motif and C-terminus of MIF, which induces the molecular thermodynamic motion of TMs for signal transduction (site 2).

The key to photocatalysis field is to search materials with suitable oxidizing and reducing potential. Herein we investigated the novel 2D γ-phosphorus nitride (γ-PN) monolayer as a candidate photocatalyst for reducing water into hydrogen and oxygen from the first-principles and molecular dynamics calculations. Our results show that the 2D γ-PN monolayer is an indirect semiconductor whose conduction and valence band edges matches well with the chemical potential of H+/H2 and O2/H2O. Strain effect is considered to tune the electronic properties of γ-PN. The calculation results reveal that tensile strain decreases the band gap and upshifts the work function of the γ-PN monolayer. The γ-PN monolayer at the 10% tensile strain shows the optimal performance in catalysing the water-splitting due to the low band gap and the better absorption spectrum at the UV-visible light range. Furthermore, the molecular dynamics shows that the γ-PN in the aqueous solution always keep stable after 100 ps simulation.

Currently, comprehensive DDI evaluation has become a major challenge in pharmaceutical research due to the time-consuming and costly process of the experimental assessment and it is of high necessity to develop effective in silico methods to predict and evaluate DDIs accurately and efficiently. In this study, based on a large number of substrates and inhibitors related to five important CYP450 isozymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4), a series of high-performance predictive models for metabolic DDIs were constructed by two machine learning methods (random forest and XGBoost) and 4 different types of descriptors (MOE_2D, CATS, ECFP4 and MACCS). To reduce the uncertainty of individual models, the consensus method was applied to yield more reliable predictions. A series of evaluations illustrated that the consensus models were more reliable and robust for the DDI predictions of new drug combination. For the internal validation, the whole prediction accuracy and AUC value of the DDI models were around 0.8 and 0.9, respectively. When it was applied to the external datasets, the model accuracy was 0.793 and 0.795 for multi-level validation and external validation, respectively. Furthermore, we also compared our model with some recently published tools and then applied the final model to predict FDA-approved drugs and proposed 54,013 possible drug pairs with potential DDIs.

A large number of ALK inhibitors with diverse scaffolds have been discovered, and most of them belong to Type-I inhibitors that only occupy the ATP-binding pocket. Recently, we reported a series of novel and potent Type-I1/2 inhibitors of ALK with the 1-purine-3-piperidinecarboxamide scaffold, which can bind to both the ATP-binding site of ALK and the adjacent hydrophobic allosteric pocket. In this study, the binding mechanisms of these Type-I1/2 ALK inhibitors were elucidated by multiple molecular modeling techniques. The calculation results demonstrate that the ensemble docking based on multiple protein structures and the MM/PB(GB)SA calculations based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations yield better predictions than conventional rigid receptor docking (Glide, Surflex-Dock, and Autodock Vina), highlighting the importance of incorporating receptor flexibility in the predictions of binding poses and binding affinities of Type-I1/2 ALK inhibitors. Furthermore, the umbrella sampling (US) simulations and MM/GBSA binding free energy decomposition analyses indicate that Leu1122, Leu1198, Gly1202 and Glu1210 in the hinge region and Glu1197, Ile1171, Phe1174, Ile1179, His1247, Ile1268, Asp1270 and Phe1271 in the allosteric pocket of ALK are the key residues for determining the relative binding strength of the studied inhibitors. Besides, we found that the most potent inhibitor (001-017) tends to form stronger transient interactions with residues along the dissociation channel due to the high electronegativity of its bulky 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylamine tail. As a whole, both the stronger binding affinity and the higher energetic barrier (which may prolong the drug-target residence time) of 001-017 contribute to its excellent anti-proliferation activity against ALK-positive cancer cells.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c827882c67ad08e84d5bbcbf0c57831f015a774,"The calculation results demonstrate that the ensemble docking based on multiple protein structures and the MM/PB(GB)SA calculations based on molecular dynamics simulations yield better predictions than conventional rigid receptor docking, highlighting the importance of incorporating receptor flexibility in the predictions of binding poses and binding affinities of Type-I1/2 ALK inhibitors.",X.

Recently, aggregated SWCNTs have shown more significant effects on the treatment of methamphetamine addiction (Nat. Nanotech. 2016, 11, 613). However, the mechanisms underlying these actions are unclear. By using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the effects of single and aggregated SWCNTs (single-(10,10)CNT, aggregated-7-(10,10)CNTs, and single-(35,35)CNT with the same diameter as that of the aggregated one) on the activity of dopamine-related proteins [tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrOH) and dopamine transporter (DAT), which are related to the synthesis and transport of dopamine, respectively]. We find that both TyrOH and DAT can adsorb onto these SWCNTs. For TyrOH, the aggregated-7-(10,10)CNTs mainly affect the conformation of the active site of the protein, and hence, they are more effective in inhibiting the expression of TyrOH. For DAT, our results suggest that the aggregated-7-(10,10)CNTs allow DAT to maintain an outward-facing conformation and hence are favorable to the reuptake of dopamine. The binding of a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, [3H]-WIN35,428, to DAT is significantly disrupted by aggregated-7-(10,10)CNTs and hence improve the ability to transport dopamine.

For bilayer graphene adsorbed onto a H-passivated Si surface, the band gap opens up to 108 meV owing to asymmetry introduction.

In our docking procedure, surface complementarity and energetic complementarity of a ligand with its receptor have been considered separately in a two-stage docking method. The first stage was to find a set of potential associated sites mainly based on surface complementarity using a genetic algorithm combined with a tabu search. This step corresponds with the process of finding the potential binding sites where pharmacophores will bind. In the second stage, several hundreds of GA minimization steps were performed for each associated site derived from the first stage mainly based on the energetic complementarity. After calculations for both of the two stages, we can offer several solutions of associated sites for every complex. In this paper, seven biomolecular systems, including five bound complexes and two unbound complexes, were chosen from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to test our method. The calculated results were very encouraging-the hybrid minimization algorithm successfully reaches the correct solutions near the best binded modes for these protein complexes. The docking results not only predict the bound complexes very well, but also get a relatively accurate complexed conformation for unbound systems. For the five bound complexes, the results show that surface complementarity is enough to find the precise binding modes, the top solution from the tabu list generally corresponds to the correct binding mode. For the two unbound complexes, due to the conformational changes upon binding, it seems more difficult to get their correct binding conformations. The predicted results show that the correct binding mode also corresponds to a relatively large surface complementarity score. In these two test cases, the correct solution can be found in the top several solutions from the tabu list. For unbound complexes, the interaction energy from energetic complementarity is very important, it can be used to filter these solutions from the surface complementarity. After the evaluation of the energetic complementarity, the conformations and orientations close to the crystallographically determined structures are resolved. In most cases, the smallest root mean square distance (r.m.s.d.) from the GA combined with TA solutions is in a relatively small region.

However, most of them used a set of predefined molecular properties, such as molecular fingerprints, for model construction, which is knowledge-dependent and may lead to biased predictions due to the representation preference of different molecular properties used for training. To solve the problem, we present a new architecture based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and develop a high-accuracy atomic charge prediction model named DeepAtomicCharge. The new GCN architecture is designed with only the atomic properties and the connection information between the atoms in molecules and can dynamically learn and convert molecules into appropriate atomic features without any prior knowledge of the molecules. Using the designed GCN architecture, substantial improvement is achieved for the prediction accuracy of atomic charges. The average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of DeepAtomicCharge is 0.0121 e, which is obviously more accurate than that (0.0180 e) reported by the previous benchmark study on the same two external test sets.

However, FLuc inhibitors can interfere with the activity of luciferase, which may result in false positive signals in HTS assays. In order to reduce the unnecessary cost of time and money, an in silico prediction model for FLuc inhibitors is highly desirable. In this study, we built an extensive data set consisting of 20 888 FLuc inhibitors and 198 608 noninhibitors, and then developed a group of classification models based on the combination of three machine learning (ML) algorithms and four types of molecular representations. The best prediction model based on XGBoost and ECFP4 and MOE2d descriptors yielded a balanced accuracy (BA) of 0.878 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.958 for the validation set, and a BA of 0.886 and an AUC of 0.947 for the test set. Three external validation sets, including set 1 (3231 FLuc inhibitors and 69 783 noninhibitors), set 2 (695 FLuc inhibitors and 75 913 noninhibitors), and set 3 (1138 FLuc inhibitors and 8155 noninhibitors), were used to verify the predictive ability of our models. The BA values for the three external validation sets given by the best model are 0.864, 0.845, and 0.791, respectively. In addition, the important features or structural fragments related to FLuc inhibitors were recognized by the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method along with their influences on predictions, which may provide valuable clues to detecting undesirable luciferase inhibitors. Based on the important and explanatory features, 16 rules were proposed for detecting FLuc inhibitors, which can achieve a correction rate of 70% for FLuc inhibitors. Furthermore, a comparison with existing prediction rules and models for FLuc inhibitors used in virtual screening verified the high reliability of the models and rules proposed in this study. We also used the model to screen three curated chemical databases, and almost 10% of the molecules in the evaluated databases were predicted as inhibitors, highlighting the potential risk of false positives in luciferase-based assays.

Recently, different states of the RNA-recognition motif (RRM) of RBPMS, one in its free form and another in complex with CAC-containing RNA, were determined by X-ray crystallography. In this article, the free RRM domain, its wild type complex and 2 mutant complex systems are studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Through comparison of free RRM domain and complex systems, it's found that the RNA binding facilitates stabilizing the RNA-binding interface of RRM domain, especially the C-terminal loop. Although both R38Q and T103A/K104A mutations reduce the binding affinity of RRM domain and RNA, the underlining mechanisms are different. Principal component analysis (PCA) and Molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) methods were used to explore the dynamical and recognition mechanisms of RRM domain and RNA. R38Q mutation is positioned on the homodimerization interface and mainly induces the large fluctuations of RRM domains. This mutation does not directly act on the RNA-binding interface, but some interfacial hydrogen bonds are weakened. In contrast, T103A/K104A mutations are located on the RNA-binding interface of RRM domain. These mutations obviously break most of high occupancy hydrogen bonds in the RNA-binding interface.

First, a model of LIMK2 was generated through molecular homology modeling, and the studied inhibitors were docked into the binding active site of LIMK2 by the docking protocol, taking into consideration the flexibility of the protein. The binding poses predicted by molecular docking for 17 selected inhibitors with different bioactivities complexed with LIMK2 underwent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and the binding free energies for the complexes were predicted by using the molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) method. The predicted binding free energies correlated well with the experimental bioactivities (r(2) = 0.63 or 0.62).

Unfortunately, it is still unavailable to conduct large-scale wet-lab mutation experiments because of the unaffordable experimental time and financial costs. Alternatively, in silico computation can serve as a pioneer to guide the experiments. In fact, numerous pioneering works have been conducted from computationally cheaper machine-learning (ML) methods to the more expensive alchemical methods with the purpose to accurately predict the mutation effects. However, these methods usually either cannot result in a physically understandable model (ML-based methods) or work with huge computational resources (alchemical methods). Thus, compromised methods with good physical characteristics and high computational efficiency are expected. Therefore, here, we conducted a comprehensive investigation on the mutation issues of biological systems with the famous end-point binding free energy calculation methods represented by MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA. Different computational strategies considering different length of MD simulations, different value of dielectric constants and whether to incorporate entropy effects to the predicted total binding affinities were investigated to provide a more accurate way for predicting the energetic change upon protein mutations. Overall, our result shows that a relatively long MD simulation (e.g. 100 ns) benefits the prediction accuracy for both MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA (with the best Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted ∆∆G and the experimental data of ~ 0.44 for a challenging dataset). Further analyses shows that systems involving large perturbations (e.g. multiple mutations and large number of atoms change in the mutation site) are much easier to be accurately predicted since the algorithm works more sensitively to the large change of the systems. Besides, system-specific investigation reveals that conformational adjustment is needed to refine the micro-environment of the manually mutated systems and thus lead one to understand why longer MD simulation is necessary to improve the predicting result. The proposed strategy is expected to be applied in large-scale mutation effects investigation with interpretation.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f15a49aefa0c7136e4bcaeb8a638950de7aa05aa,A comprehensive investigation on the mutation issues of biological systems with the famous end-point binding free energy calculation methods represented by MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA shows that systems involving large perturbations are much easier to be accurately predicted since the algorithm works more sensitively to the large change of the systems.,Y.

The interaction between virus RNA and host protein (IVRHP) is unique compared to other virus-host molecular interactions and represents not only an attempt by viruses to promote their translation/replication, but also the host's endeavor to combat viral pathogenicity. In other words, there is an urgent need to develop a database for providing such IVRHP data.

In this study, we introduce a more elegant transformer-based framework with focused attention for molecular representation (TransFoxMol) to improve the understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) of molecular structure property relationships. TransFoxMol incorporates a multi-scale 2D molecular environment into a graph neural network + Transformer module and uses prior chemical maps to obtain a more focused attention landscape compared to that obtained using existing approaches. Experimental results show that TransFoxMol achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet benchmarks and surpasses the performance of baselines that use self-supervised learning or geometry-enhanced strategies on small-scale datasets. Subsequent analyses indicate that TransFoxMol's predictions are highly interpretable and the clever use of chemical knowledge enables AI to perceive molecules in a simple but rational way, enhancing performance.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3610b381566974434e071c1a46232742e60e08de,Experimental results show that TransFoxMol achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet benchmarks and surpasses the performance of baselines that use self-supervised learning or geometry-enhanced strategies on small-scale datasets.,J.

Recently, the discovery of inhibitors that block a single isoform of PI3K has continued to attract special attention because they may have higher selectivity for certain tumors and less toxicity for healthy cells. The PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ share fewer studies than α/γ, and therefore, in this work, the combination of molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations was employed to explore the binding of three isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors (COM8, IC87114, and GDC-0941) to PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ. The isoform specificities of the studied inhibitors derived from the predicted binding free energies are in good agreement with the experimental data. In addition, the key residues critical for PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ selectivity were highlighted by decomposing the binding free energies into the contributions from individual residues. It was observed that although PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ share the conserved ATP-binding pockets, individual residues do behave differently, particularly the residues critical for PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ selectivity. It can be concluded that the inhibitor specificity between PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ is determined by the additive contributions from multiple residues, not just a single one.

We have previously shown that HBV can activate the expression of RRM2 and the activity of RR enzyme for the viral DNA replication in host liver cells. Thus, RRM2 may be an important therapeutic target for HCC and HBV-related HCC. Pterostilbene, a natural plant component, potently inhibited in vitro RR enzyme activity with the IC50 of about 0.62 μM through interacting with RRM2 protein, which was much higher than current RRM2 inhibitory drugs. Pterostilbine inhibited cell proliferation with an MTT IC50 of about 20-40 μM in various HCC cell lines, causing DNA synthesis inhibition, cell cycle arrest at S phase, and accordingly apoptosis. On the other hand, the compound significantly inhibited HBV DNA replication in HBV genome integrated and newly transfected HCC cells, and the EC50 for inhibiting HBV replication was significantly lower than the IC50 for inhibiting HCC proliferation. Notably, pterostilbene possessed a similar inhibitory activity in sorafenib and lamivudine resistant HCC cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of pterostilbine against HCC proliferation and HBV replication were significantly reversed by addition of dNTP precursors, suggesting that RR was the intracellular target of the compound. Finally, pterostilbine effectively inhibited HCC xenograft growth with a relatively low toxicity in nude mouse experiments.

To decipher the binding specificity of PDZ domain, we analyzed the interactions between 11 mouse PDZ domains and 217 [corrected] peptides using a method called MIEC-SVM, which energetically characterizes the domain-peptide interaction using molecular interaction energy components (MIECs) and predicts binding specificity using support vector machine (SVM). Cross-validation and leave-one-domain-out test showed that the MIEC-SVM using all 44 PDZ-peptide residue pairs at the interaction interface outperformed the sequence-based methods in the literature. A further feature (residue pair) selection procedure illustrated that 16 residue pairs were uninformative to the binding specificity, even though they contributed significantly (~50%) to the binding energy. If only using the 28 informative residue pairs, the performance of the MIEC-SVM on predicting the PDZ binding specificity was significantly improved. This analysis suggests that the informative and uninformative residue interactions between the PDZ domain and the peptide may represent those contributing to binding specificity and affinity, respectively. We performed additional structural and energetic analyses to shed light on understanding how the PDZ-peptide recognition is established.

The study was conducted on a selected set of eleven compounds with variation in structure and activity. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed at 300 K for 100 ps with equilibration for 50 ps. The structural analyses of the trajectories indicate that the coordinate bond interactions, the hydrogen bond interactions, the van der Waals interactions as well as the hydrophobic interactions between ligand and receptor are responsible simultaneously for the preference of inhibition and potency. The ligand hydroxamate group is coordinated to the catalytic zinc ion and form stable hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly 162. The P1' group makes extensive van der Waals and hydrophobic contacts with the nonpolar side chains of several residues in the S1' subsite, including Leu 197, Val 198, Leu 218 and Tyr 223. Moreover, four to eight hydrogen bonds between hydroxamates and MMP-2 are formed to stabilize the inhibitors in the active site. Compared with the P2' and P3' groups, the P1' groups of inhibitors are oriented regularly, which is produced by the restrain of the S1' subsite. From the relationship between the length of the nonpolar P1' group and the biological activity, we confirm that MMP-2 has a pocket-like S1' subsite, not a channel-like S1' subsite proposed by Kiyama (Kiyama, R. et al., J.

Selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators (SGRMs) are expected to have promising anti-inflammatory efficacy but with fewer side effects caused by GCs. Here, we reported HT-15, a prospective SGRM discovered by structure-based virtual screening (VS) and bioassays.

Compared with Dex, HT-15 shows less transactivation potency that is associated with the main adverse effects of synthetic GCs, and no cross activities with other nuclear receptors. Furthermore, HT-15 exhibits very weak inhibition on the ratio of OPG/RANKL. Therefore, it may reduce the side effects induced by normal GCs.

Understanding NA-ligand interactions at the atomic scale is essential for investigating the molecular mechanism and further assisting in NA-targeted drug discovery. Molecular docking is one of the predominant computational approaches for predicting the interactions between NAs and small molecules. Despite the availability of versatile docking programs, their performance profiles for NA-ligand complexes have not been thoroughly characterized. In this study, we first compiled the largest structure-based NA-ligand binding data set to date, containing 800 noncovalent NA-ligand complexes with clearly identified ligands. Based on this extensive data set, eight frequently used docking programs, including six protein-ligand docking programs (LeDock, Surflex-Dock, UCSF Dock6, AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, and PLANTS) and two specific NA-ligand docking programs (rDock and RLDOCK), were systematically evaluated in terms of binding pose and binding affinity predictions. The results demonstrated that some protein-ligand docking programs, specifically PLANTS and LeDock, produced more promising or comparable results compared with the specialized NA-ligand docking programs. Among the programs evaluated, PLANTS, rDock, and LeDock showed the highest performance in binding pose prediction, and their top-1 and best root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) success rates were as follows: PLANTS (35.93 and 76.05%), rDock (27.25 and 72.16%), and LeDock (27.40 and 64.37%). Compared with the moderate level of binding pose prediction, few programs were successful in binding affinity prediction, and the best correlation (Rp = -0.461) was observed with PLANTS.

A major challenge for the clinically used AR antagonists is the rapid emergence of resistance induced by the mutations at AR ligand binding domain (LBD), and therefore the discovery of novel anti-AR therapeutics that can combat mutation-induced resistance is quite demanding. Therein, blocking the interaction between AR and DNA represents an innovative strategy. However, the hits confirmed targeting on it so far are all structurally based on a sole chemical scaffold. In this study, an integrated docking-based virtual screening (VS) strategy based on the crystal structure of the DNA binding domain (DBD) of AR was conducted to search for novel AR antagonists with new scaffolds and 2-(2-butyl-1,3-dioxoisoindoline-5-carboxamido)-4,5-dimethoxybenzoicacid (Cpd39) was identified as a potential hit, which was competent to block the binding of AR DBD to DNA and showed decent potency against AR transcriptional activity. Furthermore, Cpd39 was safe and capable of effectively inhibiting the proliferation of PCa cell lines (i.e., LNCaP, PC3, DU145, and 22RV1) and reducing the expression of the genes regulated by not only the full-length AR but also the splice variant AR-V7.

However, accurate determination of matched molecular pair (MMP) transformations largely depend on the size and quality of existing experimental data. Lack of high-quality experimental data heavily hampers the extraction of more effective medicinal chemistry knowledge. Here, we developed a new strategy called quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)-assisted-MMPA to expand the number of chemical transformations and took the logD7.4 property endpoint as an example to demonstrate the reliability of the new method. A reliable logD7.4 consensus prediction model was firstly established, and its applicability domain was strictly assessed. By applying the reliable logD7.4 prediction model to screen two chemical databases, we obtained more high-quality logD7.4 data by defining a strict applicability domain threshold. Then, MMPA was performed on the predicted data and experimental data to derive more chemical rules. To validate the reliability of the chemical rules, we compared the magnitude and directionality of the property changes of the predicted rules with those of the measured rules. Then, we compared the novel chemical rules generated by our proposed approach with the published chemical rules, and found that the magnitude and directionality of the property changes were consistent, indicating that the proposed QSAR-assisted-MMPA approach has the potential to enrich the collection of rule types or even identify completely novel rules. Finally, we found that the number of the MMP rules derived from the experimental data could be amplified by the predicted data, which is helpful for us to analyze the medicinal chemical rules in local chemical environment.

The predicted binding energies of the selected inhibitors correlate well with their experimental activities (r(2) = 0.78).

Besides interrupting the PPIs with PPI inhibitors/blockers, increasing evidence shows that stabilizing the interaction between two interacting proteins may also benefit the therapy, such as the development of various types of molecular glues/stabilizers that mostly work by stabilizing the two interacting proteins to regulate the downstream biological effects. However, characterizing the stabilization effect of a stabilizer is usually hard or too complicated for traditional experiments since it involves ternary interactions [protein-protein-stabilizer (PPS) interaction]. Thus, developing reliable computational strategies will facilitate the discovery/design of molecular glues or PPI stabilizers. Here, by fully analyzing the energetic features of the binary interactions in the PPS ternary complex, we systematically investigated the performance of molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) methods on characterizing the stabilization effects of stabilizers in 14-3-3 systems. The results show that both MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA are powerful tools in distinguishing the stabilizers from the decoys (with area under the curves of 0.90-0.93 for all tested cases) and are reasonable for ranking protein-peptide interactions in the presence or absence of stabilizers as well (with the average Pearson correlation coefficient of ~0.6 at a relatively high dielectric constant for both methods).

Thus, the molecular structure can be recovered by assembling the detected atoms and bonds. Our approach integrates all the detection and property prediction tasks into a single fully CNN, which is scalable and capable of processing molecular images quite efficiently.

With the increasing development of biotechnology and information technology, publicly available data in chemistry and biology are undergoing explosive growth. Such wealthy information in these resources needs to be extracted and then transformed to useful knowledge by various data mining methods. However, a main computational challenge is how to effectively represent or encode molecular objects under investigation such as chemicals, proteins, DNAs and even complicated interactions when data mining methods are employed. To further explore these complicated data, an integrated toolkit to represent different types of molecular objects and support various data mining algorithms is urgently needed.


RESULTS
We developed a freely available R/CRAN package, called BioMedR, for molecular representations of chemicals, proteins, DNAs and pairwise samples of their interactions. The current version of BioMedR could calculate 293 molecular descriptors and 13 kinds of molecular fingerprints for small molecules, 9920 protein descriptors based on protein sequences and six types of generalized scale-based descriptors for proteochemometric modeling, more than 6000 DNA descriptors from nucleotide sequences and six types of interaction descriptors using three different combining strategies. Moreover, this package realized five similarity calculation methods and four powerful clustering algorithms as well as several useful auxiliary tools, which aims at building an integrated analysis pipeline for data acquisition, data checking, descriptor calculation and data modeling.


CONCLUSION
BioMedR provides a comprehensive and uniform R package to link up different representations of molecular objects with each other and will benefit cheminformatics/bioinformatics and other biomedical users.

In log D7.4 prediction, graph neural networks (GNNs) can uncover subtle structure-property relationships (SPRs) by automatically extracting features from molecular graphs that facilitate the learning of SPRs, but their performances are often limited by the small size of available datasets. Herein, we present a transfer learning strategy called pretraining on computational data and then fine-tuning on experimental data (PCFE) to fully exploit the predictive potential of GNNs. PCFE works by pretraining a GNN model on 1.71 million computational log D data (low-fidelity data) and then fine-tuning it on 19,155 experimental log D7.4 data (high-fidelity data). The experiments for three GNN architectures (graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), and Attentive FP) demonstrated the effectiveness of PCFE in improving GNNs for log D7.4 predictions. Moreover, the optimal PCFE-trained GNN model (cx-Attentive FP, Rtest2 = 0.909) outperformed four excellent descriptor-based models (random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)). The robustness of the cx-Attentive FP model was also confirmed by evaluating the models with different training data sizes and dataset splitting strategies. Therefore, we developed a webserver and defined the applicability domain for this model. The webserver (http://tools.scbdd.com/chemlogd/) provides free log D7.4 prediction services.

Despite having been activated through phosphorylation and provided with ATP ligands, several near-atomistic cryo-EM structures of CFTR are in a closed state, as inferred from the lack of a continuous passage through a hydrophobic bottleneck region located in the extracellular portion of the pore. Here, we present repeated, microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations of human CFTR solvated in a lipid bilayer and aqueous NaCl. At equilibrium, Cl- ions enter the channel through a lateral intracellular portal and bind to two distinct cationic sites inside the channel pore but do not traverse the narrow, de-wetted bottleneck. Simulations conducted in the presence of a strong hyperpolarizing electric field led to spontaneous Cl- translocation events through the bottleneck region of the channel, suggesting that the protein relaxed to a functionally open state. Conformational changes of small magnitude involving transmembrane helices 1 and 6 preceded ion permeation through diverging exit routes at the extracellular end of the pore. The pore bottleneck undergoes wetting prior to Cl- translocation, suggesting that it acts as a hydrophobic gate. Although permeating Cl- ions remain mostly hydrated, partial dehydration occurs at the binding sites and in the bottleneck. The observed Cl- pathway is largely consistent with the loci of mutations that alter channel conductance, anion binding, and ion selectivity, supporting the model of the open state of CFTR obtained in the present study.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c3dc6a5c655547b1628772e366a6c4f412ad8be,"The studies surveyed here are mainly focused on the working mechanisms of ABC transporters, including binding of substrates, conformational coupling between nucleotide‐binding domains (NBDs) and transmembrane domains, dynamics of NBDs, and global movement of completetransporters.",ZW.

The potential energy functions for these simulations were constructed in a semi-empirical way from existing potentials and experimental energetic data. The MD simulations were employed to analyze the dynamic properties of the benzene-zeolite systems. The adsorption energies of benzene/siliceous zeolite complexes increase with increasing loading number, due to the intermolecular attraction between benzene molecules. The self-diffusion coefficient of benzene in siliceous zeolites decreases with increasing loading due to the steric hindrance between the sorbates passing each other. From the zeolite-benzene radial distribution functions it was found that the benzene molecules are relatively far from each other, about 5.2A for siliceous FAU, 5.2A for siliceous ZSM-5, and 4.8A for siliceous MCM-22. In the case of FAU, the benzene molecules prefer to be adsorbed parallel to the surface of the sodalite cage above the six-membered-ring.

Numerous new experimental techniques and computational approaches have been developed to assist the design of PPI modulators during the past two decades. However, identification and optimization of small-molecule inhibitors targeting PPIs is still a particularly challenging task due to the ""undruggable"" profiles of PPI interfaces. Nowadays, in silico screening, especially docking-based virtual screening, has emerged as an effective method to complement experimental high-throughput screening in identifying novel and potent small-molecule PPI inhibitors. Here, on the basis of the 2P2IDB database, we explored the structural features of the known small-molecule PPI inhibitors and analyzed the characteristics of the PPI binding pockets. More importantly, we evaluated the sampling power and screening power of six popular docking programs for PPI targets. Our results indicate that the chlorinated conjugate group and amidelike linkage are two types of privileged fragments of PPI inhibitors; the average druggability of the binding sites of the PPI targets in 2P2IDB is slightly worse than that of traditional ones; both academic and commercial docking programs exhibit an acceptable accuracy on pose prediction for PPI inhibitors, but their screening powers for identifying PPI inhibitors are still not satisfactory.

However, a simpler device architecture based on a single organic semiconductor (SS-OPV) offers several advantages: it obviates the need to control the highly system-dependent nanoscale BHJ morphology, and therefore, would allow the use of broader range of organic semiconductors. Unfortunately, the photocurrent in standard SS-OPV devices is typically very low, which generally is attributed to inefficient charge separation of the photogenerated excitons. Here we show that the short-circuit current density from SS-OPV devices can be enhanced significantly (∼100-fold) through the use of inverted device configurations, relative to a standard OPV device architecture. This result suggests that charge generation may not be the performance bottleneck in OPV device operation. Instead, poor charge collection, caused by defect-induced electric field screening, is most likely the primary performance bottleneck in regular-geometry SS-OPV cells. We justify this hypothesis by: (i) detailed numerical simulations, (ii) electrical characterization experiments of functional SS-OPV devices using multiple polymers as active layer materials, and (iii) impedance spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, we show that the collection-limited photocurrent theory consistently interprets typical characteristics of regular SS-OPV devices. These insights should encourage the design and OPV implementation of high-purity, high-mobility polymers, and other soft materials that have shown promise in organic field-effect transistor applications, but have not performed well in BHJ OPV devices, wherein they adopt less-than-ideal nanostructures when blended with electron-accepting materials.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1b90616e3db048b1e7e0287d6b37182afbebd4f3,,B.

Traditional LD methodologies rely on a search and scoring framework, utilizing heuristic algorithms to explore binding conformations and scoring functions to evaluate binding strengths. However, to meet the efficiency demands of SBVS, these algorithms and functions are often simplified, prioritizing speed over accuracy.The emergence of deep learning (DL) has exerted a profound impact on diverse fields, ranging from natural language processing to computer vision and drug discovery. DeepMind's AlphaFold2 has impressively exhibited its ability to accurately predict protein structures solely from amino acid sequences, highlighting the remarkable potential of DL in conformation prediction. This groundbreaking advancement circumvents the traditional search-scoring frameworks in LD, enhancing both accuracy and processing speed and thereby catalyzing a broader adoption of DL algorithms in binding pose prediction. Nevertheless, a consensus on certain aspects remains elusive.In this Account, we delineate the current status of employing DL to augment LD within the VS paradigm, highlighting our contributions to this domain. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and future prospects, drawing insights from our scholarly investigations. Initially, we present an overview of VS and LD, followed by an introduction to DL paradigms, which deviate significantly from traditional search-scoring frameworks. Subsequently, we delve into the challenges associated with the development of DL-based LD (DLLD), encompassing evaluation metrics, application scenarios, and physical plausibility of the predicted conformations. In the evaluation of LD algorithms, it is essential to recognize the multifaceted nature of the metrics. While the accuracy of binding pose prediction, often measured by the success rate, is a pivotal aspect, the scoring/screening power and computational speed of these algorithms are equally important given the pivotal role of LD tools in VS. Regarding application scenarios, early methods focused on blind docking, where the binding site is unknown. However, recent studies suggest a shift toward identifying binding sites rather than solely predicting binding poses within these models. In contrast, LD with a known pocket in VS has been shown to be more practical. Physical plausibility poses another significant challenge. Although DLLD models often achieve higher success rates compared to traditional methods, they may generate poses with implausible local structures, such as incorrect bond angles or lengths, which are disadvantageous for postprocessing tasks like visualization. Finally, we discuss the future perspectives for DLLD, emphasizing the need to improve generalization ability, strike a balance between speed and accuracy, account for protein conformation flexibility, and enhance physical plausibility. Additionally, we delve into the comparison between generative and regression algorithms in this context, exploring their respective strengths and potential.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/87c4fb759a90984191ed4be4f00ab1fefff8ae9e,"This Account delineates the current status of employing DL to augment LD within the VS paradigm, and delves into the challenges associated with the development of DL-based LD (DLLD), encompassing evaluation metrics, application scenarios, and physical plausibility of the predicted conformations.",X.

To this end, we create a large-scale complex dataset containing ∼9 M protein-ligand docking complexes for pre-training, and propose CarsiDock, the first deep learning-guided docking approach that leverages pre-training of millions of predicted protein-ligand complexes. CarsiDock contains two main stages, i.e., a deep learning model for the prediction of protein-ligand atomic distance matrices, and a translation, rotation and torsion-guided geometry optimization procedure to reconstruct the matrices into a credible binding pose. The pre-training and multiple innovative architectural designs facilitate the dramatically improved docking accuracy of our approach over the baselines in terms of multiple docking scenarios, thereby contributing to its outstanding early recognition performance in several retrospective virtual screening campaigns.

Considering that the experimental measurement of the property is costly and time-consuming, it is of great importance to develop reliable prediction models for logP. In this study, we developed a transfer free energy-based logP prediction model-FElogP. FElogP is based on the simple principle that logP is determined by the free energy change of transferring a molecule from water to n-octanol. The underlying physical method to calculate transfer free energy is the molecular mechanics-Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA), thus this method is named as free energy-based logP (FElogP). The superiority of FElogP model was validated by a large set of 707 structurally diverse molecules in the ZINC database for which the measurement was of high quality. Encouragingly, FElogP outperformed several commonly-used QSPR or machine learning-based logP models, as well as some continuum solvation model-based methods.

Ischemia-evoked neuroinflammation is implicated in the progressive brain injury after cerebral ischemia, while Caspase-1, an active component of inflammasome, exaggerates ischemic brain injury. Current Caspase-1 inhibitors are inadequate in safety and druggability. Here, we investigated the efficacy of CZL80, a novel Caspase-1 inhibitor, in mice with PIS. Mice and Caspase-1-/- mice were subjected to photothrombotic (PT)-induced cerebral ischemia. CZL80 (10, 30 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.p.) was administered for one week after PT onset. The transient and the progressive neurological dysfunction (as foot faults in the grid-walking task and forelimb symmetry in the cylinder task) was assessed on Day1 and Day4-7, respectively, after PT onset. Treatment with CZL80 (30 mg/kg) during Day1-7 significantly reduced the progressive, but not the transient neurological dysfunction. Furthermore, we showed that CZL80 administered on Day4-7, when the progressive neurological dysfunction occurred, produced significant beneficial effects against PIS, suggesting an extended therapeutic time-window. CZL80 administration could improve the neurological function even as late as Day43 after PT. In Caspase-1-/- mice with PIS, the beneficial effects of CZL80 were abolished. We found that Caspase-1 was upregulated during Day4-7 after PT and predominantly located in activated microglia, which was coincided with the progressive neurological deficits, and attenuated by CZL80. We showed that CZL80 administration did not reduce the infarct volume, but significantly suppressed microglia activation in the peri-infarct cortex, suggesting the involvement of microglial inflammasome in the pathology of PIS.

However, it is still hard to determine the molecular type of a LBP-bound ligand because both the agonists and antagonists bind to the same position of the protein. Therefore, it is necessary to develop precise and efficient methods to facilitate the discrimination of agonists and antagonists targeting the LBP of NRs.

A large number of PROTACs have been reported, but due to the complicated structural and kinetic characteristics of the target-PROTAC-E3 ligase ternary interaction process, the rational design of PROTACs is still quite challenging. Here, we characterized and analyzed the kinetic mechanism of MZ1, a PROTAC that targets the bromodomain (BD) of the bromodomain and extra terminal (BET) protein (Brd2, Brd3, or Brd4) and von Hippel-Lindau E3 ligase (VHL), from the kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives of view by using enhanced sampling simulations and free energy calculations. The simulations yielded satisfactory predictions on the relative residence time and standard binding free energy (rp > 0.9) for MZ1 in different BrdBD-MZ1-VHL ternary complexes. Interestingly, the simulation of the PROTAC ternary complex disintegration illustrates that MZ1 tends to remain on the surface of VHL with the BD proteins dissociating alone without a specific dissociation direction, indicating that the PROTAC prefers more to bind with E3 ligase at the first step in the formation of the target-PROTAC-E3 ligase ternary complex. Further exploration of the degradation difference of MZ1 in different Brd systems shows that the PROTAC with higher degradation efficiency tends to leave more lysine exposed on the target protein, which is guaranteed by the stability (binding affinity) and durability (residence time) of the target-PROTAC-E3 ligase ternary complex. It is quite possible that the underlying binding characteristics of the BrdBD-MZ1-VHL systems revealed by this study may be shared by different PROTAC systems as a general rule, which may accelerate rational PROTAC design with higher degradation efficiency.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a5ed1863293e28f7d12a4cca040e4b3197b2f5d7,"It is quite possible that the underlying binding characteristics of the BrdBD-MZ1-VHL systems revealed by this study may be shared by different PROTAC systems as a general rule, which may accelerate rational PROTAC design with higher degradation efficiency.",R.

The Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) or generalized Born (GB) combined with surface area (SA) continuum solvation method (PBSA and GBSA) have been widely used in SFE calculations because they can achieve good balance between accuracy and efficiency. However, the accuracy of these methods can be affected by several factors such as the charge models, polar and nonpolar SFE calculation methods and the atom radii used in the calculation. In this work, the performance of the ABCG2 (AM1-BCC-GAFF2) charge model as well as other two charge models, that is, RESP (Restrained Electrostatic Potential) and AM1-BCC (Austin Model 1-bond charge corrections), on the SFE prediction of 544 small molecules in water by PBSA/GBSA was evaluated. In order to improve the performance of the PBSA prediction based on the ABCG2 charge, we further explored the influence of atom radii on the prediction accuracy and yielded a set of atom radius parameters for more accurate SFE prediction using PBSA based on the ABCG2/GAFF2 by reproducing the thermodynamic integration (TI) calculation results. The PB radius parameters of carbon, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, chloride, bromide and iodine, were adjusted. New atom types, on, oi, hn1, hn2, hn3, were introduced to further improve the fitting performance. Then, we tuned the parameters in the nonpolar SFE model using the experimental SFE data and the PB calculation results. By adopting the new radius parameters and new nonpolar SFE model, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the SFE calculation for the 544 molecules decreased from 2.38 to 1.05 kcal/mol. Finally, the new radius parameters were applied in the prediction of protein-ligand binding free energies using the MM-PBSA method. For the eight systems tested, we could observe higher correlation between the experiment data and calculation results and smaller prediction errors for the absolute binding free energies, demonstrating that our new radius parameters can improve the free energy calculation using the MM-PBSA method.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c84f19ccc84db3cea17c45db69b9cf8881cad5a5,,Y.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have expanded the application of machine learning in chemistry, particularly in yield prediction, retrosynthesis, and reaction condition prediction. However, the effectiveness of these models hinges on the integrity of chemical reaction datasets, which are often plagued by inconsistencies like missing reactants, incorrect atom mappings, and outright erroneous reactions. AutoTemplate introduces a two-stage approach to refine these datasets. The first stage involves extracting meaningful reaction transformation rules and formulating generic reaction templates using a simplified SMARTS representation. This simplification broadens the applicability of templates across various chemical reactions. The second stage is template-guided reaction curation, where these templates are systematically applied to validate and correct the reaction data. This process effectively amends missing reactant information, rectifies atom-mapping errors, and eliminates incorrect data entries. A standout feature of AutoTemplate is its capability to concurrently identify and correct false chemical reactions. It operates on the premise that most reactions in datasets are accurate, using these as templates to guide the correction of flawed entries. The protocol demonstrates its efficacy across a range of chemical reactions, significantly enhancing dataset quality. This advancement provides a more robust foundation for developing reliable machine learning models in chemistry, thereby improving the accuracy of forward and retrosynthetic predictions. AutoTemplate marks a significant progression in the preprocessing of chemical reaction datasets, bridging a vital gap and facilitating more precise and efficient machine learning applications in organic synthesis.

The accurate prediction of these properties remains to be solved due to data scarcity. Current methodologies neglect the intrinsic relationships between physicochemical properties and usually ignore the ionization effects. Here, we propose an attention-driven mixture-of-experts (MoE) model named ALipSol, which explicitly reproduces the hierarchy of task relationships. We adopt the principle of divide-and-conquer by breaking down the complex end point (logD or logSw) into simpler ones (acidic pKa, basic pKa, and logP) and allocating a specific expert network for each subproblem. Subsequently, we implement transfer learning to extract knowledge from related tasks, thus alleviating the dilemma of limited data. Additionally, we substitute the gating network with an attention mechanism to better capture the dynamic task relationships on a per-example basis. We adopt local fine-tuning and consensus prediction to further boost model performance. Extensive evaluation experiments verify the success of the ALipSol model, which achieves RMSE improvement of 8.04%, 2.49%, 8.57%, 12.8%, and 8.60% on the Lipop, ESOL, AqSolDB, external logD, and external logS data sets, respectively, compared with Attentive FP and the state-of-the-art in silico tools.

In the intermolecular dimeric G4-IZCZ-3 binding complexes, IZCZ-3 prefers the c-MYC G4 that has two exposed G-tetrads per monomer over the single G-tetrad-exposed c-KIT G4 by creating more aggregation effects. Taking the aggregation effects into account, the binding affinity order of IZCZ-3 follows c-MYC G4 > c-KIT G4 > telomeric G4, agreeing well with the experimental observation.

We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge.

One of the reasons for the resistance is the internalization and recycling of PD-L1 itself upon antibody binding. The inhibition of lysosome-mediated degradation of PD-L1 is critical for preserving the amount of PD-L1 recycling back to the cell membrane. In this study, we find that Hsc70 promotes PD-L1 degradation through the endosome-lysosome pathway and reduces PD-L1 recycling to the cell membrane. This effect is dependent on Hsc70-PD-L1 binding which inhibits the CMTM6-PD-L1 interaction.

Here, as a possible way to alleviate the problem, several widely used implicit-solvent models, which are derived from the analytic generalized Born (GB) equation and implemented in the AMBER suite of programs, were employed in free energy calculations based on non-equilibrium work and evaluated for their abilities to emulate explicit water. As a test case, pulling MD simulations were carried out on an alanine polypeptide with different solvent models and protocols, followed by comparisons of the reconstructed PMF profiles along the unfolding coordinate. The results show that when employing the non-equilibrium work method, sampling with an implicit-solvent model is several times faster and, more importantly, converges more rapidly than that with explicit water due to reduction of dissipation. Among the assessed GB models, the Neck variants outperform the OBC and HCT variants in terms of accuracy, whereas their computational costs are comparable.

The fragment-wise generation paradigm offers a promising solution. However, a common challenge across both atom-wise and fragment-wise methods lies in their limited ability to co-design plausible chemical and geometrical structures, resulting in distorted conformations. In response to this challenge, we introduce the Deep Geometry Handling protocol, a more abstract design that extends the design focus beyond the model architecture.

This recognition has prompted the broader acceptance of RNA as a viable candidate for drug targets. Delving into the atomic-scale understanding of RNA-ligand interactions holds paramount importance in unraveling intricate molecular mechanisms and further contributing to RNA-based drug discovery. Computational approaches, particularly molecular docking, offer an efficient way of predicting the interactions between RNA and small molecules. However, the accuracy and reliability of these predictions heavily depend on the performance of scoring functions (SFs). In contrast to the majority of SFs used in RNA-ligand docking, the end-point binding free energy calculation methods, such as molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) and molecular mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA), stand as theoretically more rigorous approaches. Yet, the evaluation of their effectiveness in predicting both binding affinities and binding poses within RNA-ligand systems remains unexplored. This study first reported the performance of MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA with diverse solvation models, interior dielectric constants (εin) and force fields in the context of binding affinity prediction for 29 RNA-ligand complexes. MM/GBSA is based on short (5 ns) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in an explicit solvent with the YIL force field; the GBGBn2 model with higher interior dielectric constant (εin = 12, 16 or 20) yields the best correlation (Rp = -0.513), which outperforms the best correlation (Rp = -0.317, rDock) offered by various docking programs. Then, the efficacy of MM/GBSA in identifying the near-native binding poses from the decoys was assessed based on 56 RNA-ligand complexes. However, it is evident that MM/GBSA has limitations in accurately predicting binding poses for RNA-ligand systems, particularly compared with notably proficient docking programs like rDock and PLANTS. The best top-1 success rate achieved by MM/GBSA rescoring is 39.3%, which falls below the best results given by docking programs (50%, PLNATS).

To address these issues, we first created 2 standardized RC datasets covering a broad range of reaction classes and then proposed a powerful and interpretable Transformer-based RC predictor named Parrot.

Despite the introduction of deep generative models for molecular generation, the atom-wise generation paradigm that partially contradicts chemical intuition limits the validity and synthetic accessibility of the generated molecules. Additionally, the dependence of deep learning models on large-scale structural data has hindered their adaptability across different targets. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel search-based framework, 3D-MCTS, for structure-based de novo drug design. Distinct from prevailing atom-centric methods, 3D-MCTS employs a fragment-based molecular editing strategy. The fragments decomposed from small-molecule drugs are recombined under predefined retrosynthetic rules, offering improved drug-likeness and synthesizability, overcoming the inherent limitations of atom-based approaches. Leveraging multi-threaded parallel simulations combined with a real-time energy constraint-based pruning strategy, 3D-MCTS achieves remarkable efficiency. At a fixed computational cost, it outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by producing molecules with enhanced binding affinity. Furthermore, its fragment-based approach ensures the generation of more dependable binding conformations, exhibiting a success rate 43.6% higher than that of other SOTAs. This advantage becomes even more pronounced when handling targets that significantly deviate from the training dataset. 3D-MCTS is capable of achieving thirty times more hits with high binding affinity than traditional virtual screening methods, which demonstrates the superior ability of 3D-MCTS to explore chemical space. Moreover, the flexibility of our framework makes it easy to incorporate domain knowledge during the process, thereby enabling the generation of molecules with desirable pharmacophores and enhanced binding affinity.

Undoubtedly, understanding the ligand dissociation mechanisms and the structural basis of the TA regulation is crucial for the development of novel GR-targeting drugs. Here, we used random accelerated molecular dynamics (RAMD) and funnel metadynamics (FM) simulations to explore the dissociation mechanisms of 5 classic glucocorticoids and 6 nonsteroidal GR ligands.

Notably, the binding of AZD9567 poses a substantial impact on the conformation of the GR homodimer interface, which provides a valuable clue to understand the mechanisms of the TA-related side effects induced by the adjustments of the homodimerization process.

First, we explored the effects of the length of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, ranging from 400 to 4800 ps, and the solute dielectric constant (1, 2, or 4) on the binding free energies predicted by MM/PBSA. The following three important conclusions could be observed: (1) MD simulation length has an obvious impact on the predictions, and longer MD simulation is not always necessary to achieve better predictions. (2) The predictions are quite sensitive to the solute dielectric constant, and this parameter should be carefully determined according to the characteristics of the protein/ligand binding interface.

The method, SAWSA v2.0, gives the aqueous solvation free energy by summing the contributions of component atoms and a correction factor. We applied two different sets of atom typing rules and fitting processes for small organic molecules and proteins, respectively. For small organic molecules, the model classified the atoms in organic molecules into 65 basic types and additionally. For small organic molecules we proposed a correction factor of ""hydrophobic carbon"" to account for the aggregation of hydrocarbons and compounds with long hydrophobic aliphatic chains. The contributions for each atom type and correction factor were derived by multivariate regression analysis of 379 neutral molecules and 39 ions with known experimental aqueous solvation free energies. Based on the new atom typing rules, the correlation coefficient (r) for fitting the whole neutral organic molecules is 0.984, and the absolute mean error is 0.40 kcal mol(-1), which is much better than those of the model proposed by Wang et al. and the SAWSA model previously proposed by us. Furthermore, the SAWSA v2.0 model was compared with the simple atom-additive model based on the number of atom types (NA). The calculated results show that for small organic molecules, the predictions from the SAWSA v2.0 model are slightly better than those from the atom-additive model based on NA. However, for macromolecules such as proteins, due to the connection between their molecular conformation and their molecular surface area, the atom-additive model based on the number of atom types has little predictive power. In order to investigate the predictive power of our model, a systematic comparison was performed on seven solvation models including SAWSA v2.0, GB/SA_1, GB/SA_2, PB/SA_1, PB/SA_2, AM1/SM5.2R and SM5.0R. The results showed that for organic molecules the SAWSA v2.0 model is better than the other six solvation models. For proteins, the model classified the atoms into 20 basic types and the predicted aqueous free energies of solvation by PB/SA were used for fitting.

Although the original theory of FEP was proposed more than 60 years ago, subsequent applications of FEP to compute protein-ligand binding free energies in the context of drug discovery projects over much of that time period was sporadic and generally unsuccessful. This was mainly due to the limited accuracy of the available force fields, inadequate sampling of the protein-ligand conformational space, complexity of simulation set up and analysis, and the large computational resources required to pursue such calculations. Over the past few years, there have been advances in computing power, classical force field accuracy, enhanced sampling algorithms, and simulation setup.

In this work, on the basis of verifying the accuracy of 2 main kinds of binding free energy calculation methodologies [end-point method of Molecular Mechanics with Poisson-Boltzmann/Generalized Born and Surface Area (MM/PB(GB)SA) and alchemical method of Thermodynamic Integration (TI)], we performed a systematic analysis on the ALK systems to explore the underlying shared and specific drug resistance mechanisms, covering the one-drug-multiple-mutation and multiple-drug-one-mutation cases. Through conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) simulation in conjunction with MM/PB(GB)SA and umbrella sampling (US) in conjunction with contact network analysis (CNA), the resistance mechanisms of the in-pocket, out-pocket, and multiple-site mutations were revealed. Especially for the out-pocket mutation, a possible transfer chain of the mutation effect was revealed, and the reason why different drugs exhibited various sensitivities to the same mutation was also uncovered. The proposed mechanisms may be prevalent in various drug resistance cases.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4a183b6ec9b295bfe6c23982c32f5d71e075c86e,"The resistance mechanisms of the in- pocket, out-pocket, and multiple-site mutations were revealed and a possible transfer chain of the mutation effect was revealed, and the reason why different drugs exhibited various sensitivities to the same mutation was also uncovered.",Y.

Significant progress has been made by resorting to generative models for graphs. However, limited attention is paid to hierarchical generative models, which can exploit the inherent hierarchical structure (with rich semantic information) of the molecular graphs and generate complex molecules of larger size that we shall demonstrate to be difficult for most existing models. The primary challenge to hierarchical generation is the non-differentiable issue caused by the generation of intermediate discrete coarsened graph structures. To sidestep this issue, we cast the tricky hierarchical generation problem over discrete spaces as the reverse process of hierarchical representation learning and propose MolHF, a new hierarchical flow-based model that generates molecular graphs in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, MolHF first generates bonds through a multi-scale architecture, then generates atoms based on the coarsened graph structure at each scale. We demonstrate that MolHF achieves state-of-the-art performance in random generation and property optimization, implying its high capacity to model data distribution. Furthermore, MolHF is the first flow-based model that can be applied to model larger molecules (polymer) with more than 100 heavy atoms.

We propose a new algorithm based on the shooting success rate, i.e., reactivity, measured as a function of a reduced set of collective variables (CVs).

Nuclear receptors (NRs), as an important target family, play important roles in regulating a variety of physiological processes in vivo. However, it is hard to understand the drug-NR interaction process because of the closed structure of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the NR proteins, which apparently hinders the rational design of drugs with controllable kinetic properties. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanism of the ligand-NR interaction process seems necessary to help NR drug design. However, it is usually difficult for experimental approaches to interpret the kinetic process of drug-target interactions. Therefore, in silico methods were utilized to explore the optimal binding/dissociation pathways of the NR ligands. Specifically, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is considered here as the target system since it has been an important target for the treatment of bile acid metabolism-associated diseases, and a series of structures cocrystallized with diverse scaffold ligands were resolved. By using random acceleration molecular dynamics (RAMD) simulation and umbrella sampling (US), 5 main dissociation pathways (pathways I-V) were identified in 11 representative FXR ligands, with most of them (9/11) preferring to go through Pathway III and the remaining two favoring escaping from Pathway I and IV. Furthermore, key residues functioning in the three main dissociation pathways were revealed by the kinetic residue energy analysis (KREA) based on the US trajectories, which may serve as road-marker residues for rapid identification of the (un)binding pathways of FXR ligands. Moreover, the preferred pathways explored by RAMD simulations are in good agreement with the minimum free energy path identified by the US simulations with the Pearson R = 0.76 between the predicted binding affinity and the experimental data, suggesting that RAMD is suitable for applying in large-scale (un)binding-pathway exploration in the case of ligands with obscure binding tunnels to the target.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6de2760538ae0ba35b79c4b15a4e5e8eac4f9019,"In silico methods were utilized to explore the optimal binding/dissociation pathways of the nuclear receptors of farnesoid X receptor, suggesting that RAMD is suitable for applying in large-scale (un)binding-pathway exploration in the case of ligands with obscure binding tunnels to the target.",S.

Recently, the crystal structure of the vcCNT (Vibrio cholerae Concentrative Nucleoside Transporter) was reported. Here we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the vcCNT structure in the presence of various sodium gradients, since CNTs are sodium-coupled transporters. The results highlight the important role of sodium bound to the vcCNT in the transport of uridine. Our MD simulations show that, without NaCl, uridine remains stable in the binding pocket of the vcCNT. In the presence of 20 mM NaCl, uridine moves from the binding pocket and approaches the entrance of the intracellular side. In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, uridine passes through most part of the entrance and approaches the intracellular side. The polar/charged amino acids in the binding pocket are important in the transport process. They first ""fix"" the ribose and allow the uracil base of uridine to approach the entrance of the intracellular side, and then ""release"" the ribose to allow uridine to move freely into the intracellular side coupled with the movement of sodium ions and HP1b. Finally, we propose a detailed mechanism of the nucleoside transport from the binding pocket to the intracellular side of the vcCNT.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e098737e84f4861da7445cd3e8896aebc55e60f7,The results highlight the important role of sodium bound to the vcCNT in the transport of uridine and propose a detailed mechanism of the nucleoside transport from the binding pocket to the intracellular side of the vCCNT.,Z.

This method holds great promise for lead optimization (LO) in drug discovery. However, the complex data preparation and simulation process limits its widespread application in diverse protein-ligand systems. To address this challenge, we developed a comprehensive, open-source, and automated workflow for MSLD calculations based on the BLaDE dynamics engine. This workflow incorporates the Ligand Internal and Cartesian coordinate reconstruction-based alignment algorithm (LIC-align) and an optimized maximum common substructure (MCS) search algorithm to accurately generate MSLD multiple topologies with ideal perturbation patterns. Furthermore, our workflow is highly modularized, allowing straightforward integration and extension of various simulation techniques, and is highly accessible to nonexperts. This workflow was validated by calculating the relative binding free energies of large-scale congeneric ligands, many of which have large perturbing groups. The agreement between the calculations and experiments was excellent, with an average unsigned error of 1.08 ± 0.47 kcal/mol. More than 57.1% of the ligands had an error of less than 1.0 kcal/mol, and the perturbations of 6 targets were fully connected via the calculations, while those of 2 targets were connected via both calculations and experimental data. The Pearson correlation coefficient reached 0.88, indicating that the MSLD workflow provides accurate predictions that can guide lead optimization in drug discovery. We also examined the impact of single-site versus multisite perturbations, ligand grouping by perturbing group size, and the position of the anchor atom on the MSLD performance. By integrating our proposed LIC-align and optimized MCS search algorithm along with the coping strategies to handle challenging molecular substructures, our workflow can handle many realistic scenarios more reasonably than all previously published methods. Moreover, we observed that our MSLD workflow achieved similar accuracy to free energy perturbation (FEP) while improving computational efficiency by over 1 order of magnitude in speedup.

Deep learning-based lead optimization takes expert knowledge as a starting point, learning from numerous historical cases about how to modify the structure for better drug-forming properties.

Previously developed models are often limited to resolving one (or few) certain subtask(s) of lead optimization, and most of them can only generate the two-dimensional structures of molecules while disregarding the vital protein-ligand interactions based on the three-dimensional binding poses. To address these challenges, we present a novel tool for lead optimization, named Delete (Deep lead optimization enveloped in protein pocket).

However, identifying the CVs for self-assembly presents several challenges. First, self-assembly systems often consist of identical monomers, and the feature representations should be invariant to permutations and rotational symmetries. Physical coordinates, such as aggregate size, lack high-resolution detail, while common geometric coordinates like pairwise distances are hindered by the permutation and rotational symmetry challenges. Second, self-assembly is usually a downhill process, and the trajectories often suffer from insufficient sampling of backward transitions that correspond to the dissociation of self-assembled structures. Popular dimensionality reduction methods, such as time-structure independent component analysis, impose detailed balance constraints, potentially obscuring the true dynamics of self-assembly. In this work, we employ GraphVAMPnets, which combines graph neural networks with a variational approach for Markovian process (VAMP) theory to identify the slow CVs of the self-assembly processes. First, GraphVAMPnets bears the advantages of graph neural networks, in which the graph embeddings can represent self-assembly structures in high-resolution while being invariant to permutations and rotational symmetries. Second, it is built upon VAMP theory, which studies Markov processes without forcing detailed balance constraints, which addresses the out-of-equilibrium challenge in the self-assembly process. We demonstrate GraphVAMPnets for identifying slow CVs of self-assembly kinetics in two systems: the aggregation of two hydrophobic molecules and the self-assembly of patchy particles.

The aforementioned issues may not be fully captured by commonly used metrics for the assessment of molecular generative models, such as novelty, diversity, and quantitative estimation of the drug-likeness score. To address these limitations, we proposed a genetic algorithm-guided generative model called GARel (genetic algorithm-based receptor-ligand interaction generator), a novel framework for training a DL-based generative model to produce drug-like molecules with novel scaffolds. To efficiently train the GARel model, we utilized dense net to update the parameters based on molecules with novel scaffolds and drug-like features. To demonstrate the capability of the GARel model, we used it to design inhibitors for three targets: AA2AR, EGFR, and SARS-Cov2. The results indicate that GARel-generated molecules feature more diverse and novel scaffolds and possess more desirable physicochemical properties and favorable docking scores.

Most earlier models follow an atom-wise paradigm, generating molecules with good docking scores but poor molecular properties (like synthesizability and drugability). In contrast, fragment-wise generation offers a promising alternative by assembling chemically viable fragments. However, the co-design of plausible chemical and geometrical structures is still challenging, as evidenced by existing models. To address this, we introduce the Deep Geometry Handling protocol, which decomposes the entire geometry into multiple sets of geometric variables, looking beyond model architecture design. Drawing from a newly defined six-category taxonomy, we propose FragGen, a novel hybrid strategy as the first geometry-reliable, fragment-wise molecular generation method. FragGen significantly enhances both the geometric quality and synthesizability of the generated molecules, overcoming major limitations of previous models. Moreover, FragGen has been successfully applied in real-world scenarios, notably in designing type II kinase inhibitors at the ∼nM level, establishing it as the first validated 3D fragment-based drug design algorithm.

Here, we employ computational simulation methods to elucidate the activation process and key events associated with the mGlu2, including a detailed analysis of its conformational transitions, the binding of agonists, Gi protein coupling, and the guanosine diphosphate (GDP) release. Our results demonstrate that the activation of mGlu2 is a stepwise process and several energy barriers need to be overcome. Moreover, we also identify the rate-determining step of the mGlu2's transition from the agonist-bound state to its active state.

Asymmetric dimerization is critical for receptor activation. Our calculation results are consistent with the observation of cross-linking and fluorescent-labeled blot experiments, thus illustrating the reliability of our calculations.

For the first time it is observed that the binding of antagonists significantly disturbed the C-terminus of AR helix-11, thereby disrupting the specific internal hydrophobic contacts of AR-LBD and correspondingly the communication between AR ligand binding pocket (AR-LBP), activation function 2 (AF2), and binding function 3 (BF3). The subsequent bioassays verified the necessity of the hydrophobic contacts for AR function. Furthermore, it is found that darolutamide, a newly approved AR antagonist capable of fighting almost all reported drug resistant AR mutants, can induce antagonistic binding structure. Subsequently, docking-based virtual screening toward the dominant binding conformation of AR for darolutamide is conducted, and three novel AR antagonists with favorable binding affinity and strong capability to combat drug resistance are identified by in vitro bioassays.

Although previous studies have addressed the performance of AF2 structures in virtual screening (VS), a more comprehensive investigation is still necessary considering the paramount importance of structural accuracy in drug design. In this study, we evaluate the performance of AF2 structures in VS across three common drug discovery scenarios: targets with holo, apo, and AF2 structures; targets with only apo and AF2 structures; and targets exclusively with AF2 structures. We utilized both the traditional physics-based Glide and the deep-learning-based scoring function RTMscore to rank the compounds in the DUD-E, DEKOIS 2.0, and DECOY data sets. The results demonstrate that, overall, the performance of VS on AF2 structures is comparable to that on apo structures but notably inferior to that on holo structures across diverse scenarios. Moreover, when a target has solely AF2 structure, selecting the holo structure of the target from different subtypes within the same protein family produces comparable results with the AF2 structure for VS on the data set of the AF2 structures, and significantly better results than the AF2 structures on its own data set. This indicates that utilizing AF2 structures for docking-based VS may not yield most satisfactory outcomes, even when solely AF2 structures are available. Moreover, we rule out the possibility that the variations in VS performance between the binding pockets of AF2 and holo structures arise from the differences in their biological assembly composition.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c378d3b8eaca23899dc37a757650cafff8a31ec7,"The results demonstrate that utilizing AF2 structures for docking-based VS may not yield most satisfactory outcomes, even when solely AF2 structures are available, and that selecting the holo structure of the target from different subtypes within the same protein family produces significantly better results.",S.

Lorlatinib stands out as the most advanced and effective inhibitor currently used in the clinic for the treatment of ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. However, resistance to lorlatinib has inevitably manifested over time, with double/triple mutations of G1202, L1196, L1198, C1156 and I1171 frequently observed in clinical practice, and tumors regrow within a short time after treatment with lorlatinib. Therefore, elucidating the mechanism of resistance to lorlatinib is paramount in paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies and the development of next-generation drugs. In this study, we leveraged multiple computational methodologies to delve into the resistance mechanisms of three specific double mutations of ALKG1202R/L1196M, ALKG1202R/L1198F and ALKI1171N/L1198F to lorlatinib. We analyzed these mechanisms through qualitative (PCA, DCCM) and quantitative (MM/GBSA, US) kinetic analyses. The qualitative analysis shows that these mutations exert minimal perturbations on the conformational dynamics of the structural domains of ALK. The energetic and structural assessments show that the van der Waals interactions, formed by the conserved residue Leu1256 within the ATP-binding site and the residues Glu1197 and Met1199 in the hinge domain with lorlatinib, play integral roles in the occurrence of drug resistance.

However, the progress of many DL-assisted synthesis planning (DASP) algorithms has suffered from the lack of reliable automated pathway evaluation tools. As a critical metric for evaluating chemical reactions, accurate prediction of reaction yields helps improve the practicality of DASP algorithms in the real-world scenarios. Currently, accurately predicting yields of interesting reactions still faces numerous challenges, mainly including the absence of high-quality generic reaction yield datasets and robust generic yield predictors. To compensate for the limitations of high-throughput yield datasets, we curated a generic reaction yield dataset containing 12 reaction categories and rich reaction condition information. Subsequently, by utilizing 2 pretraining tasks based on chemical reaction masked language modeling and contrastive learning, we proposed a powerful bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)-based reaction yield predictor named Egret. It achieved comparable or even superior performance to the best previous models on 4 benchmark datasets and established state-of-the-art performance on the newly curated dataset. We found that reaction-condition-based contrastive learning enhances the model's sensitivity to reaction conditions, and Egret is capable of capturing subtle differences between reactions involving identical reactants and products but different reaction conditions. Furthermore, we proposed a new scoring function that incorporated Egret into the evaluation of multistep synthesis routes. Test results showed that yield-incorporated scoring facilitated the prioritization of literature-supported high-yield reaction pathways for target molecules.

Moreover, MB overcame drug resistance to the common AML drugs cytarabine and doxorubicin, and treatment with the combination of MB and the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 exerted a synergistic inhibitory effect.

Although many PTP1B inhibitors with various scaffolds have been developed, there is still a lack of PTP1B inhibitor with high specificity and acceptable pharmacological properties. Therefore, it is urgent to develop more methods to explore complex action mode of PTP1B and ligands for designing ideal PTP1B modulators. In this work, we developed a potential molecular dynamics (MD) analytic mode to analyze the mechanism of active compounds 6a and 6e against PTP1B from different perspectives, including the stable ability, interactions and binding site of ligand and protein, the binding energy, relative movement between residues and changes in protein internal interactions. The simulated results demonstrated that compound 6a bound more stably to the active pocket of PTP1B than 6e due to its smaller molecular volume (326 Å3), matched electronegativity, and enhanced the positive correlation motion of residues, especially for WPD loop and P loop. Lastly, compound 6a as a competitive inhibitor for PTP1B was verified by enzyme kinetic assay. This work successfully studied the mechanism of compound 6a against PTP1B from various aspects, enriched the analysis of interaction mode between PTP1B and inhibitors. In summary, we hope that this work could provide more theoretical information for designing and developing more novel and ideal PTP1B inhibitors in the future.",,,TT.

One of the key structural features of PAPs is the presence of a β-hairpin motif otherwise known as flap. The biological function of the PAPs is highly dependent on the conformational dynamics of the flap region. In apo PAPs, the conformational dynamics of the flap is dominated by the rotational degrees of freedom associated with χ1 and χ2 angles of conserved Tyr (or Phe in some cases). However it is plausible that dihedral order parameters associated with several other residues might play crucial roles in the conformational dynamics of apo PAPs. Due to their size, complexities associated with conformational dynamics and clinical significance (drug targets for malaria, Alzheimer's disease etc.), PAPs provide a challenging testing ground for computational and experimental methods focusing on understanding conformational dynamics and molecular recognition in biomolecules. The opening of the flap region is necessary to accommodate substrate/ligand in the active site of the PAPs. The BIG challenge is to gain atomistic details into how reversible ligand binding/unbinding (molecular recognition) affects the conformational dynamics. Recent reports of kinetics (K i, K d) and thermodynamic parameters (ΔH, TΔS, and ΔG) associated with macro-cyclic ligands bound to BACE1 (belongs to PAP family) provide a perfect challenge (how to deal with big ligands with multiple torsional angles and select optimum order parameters to study reversible ligand binding/unbinding) for computational methods to predict binding free energies and kinetics beyond typical test systems e.g. benzamide-trypsin. In this work, i reviewed several order parameters which were proposed to capture the conformational dynamics and molecular recognition in PAPs. I further highlighted how machine learning methods can be used as order parameters in the context of PAPs. I then proposed some open ideas and challenges in the context of molecular simulation and put forward my case on how biophysical experiments e.g. NMR, time-resolved FRET etc. can be used in conjunction with biomolecular simulation to gain complete atomistic insights into the conformational dynamics of PAPs.",,,S.

Compounds DH-18 and DH-19 exerted the most effective MMP-2 inhibition (IC50 of 139.45 nM and 115.16 nM, respectively) with potent antileukemic efficacy against the CML cell line K562 (IC50 of 0.338 µM and 0.398 µM, respectively). The lead molecules DH-18 and DH-19 reduced the MMP-2 expression by 21.3% and 17.8%, respectively with effective apoptotic induction (45.4% and 39.8%, respectively) in the K562 cell line. Moreover, both these compounds significantly arrested different phases of the cell cycle. Again, both these molecules depicted promising antiangiogenic efficacy in the ACHN cell line. Nevertheless, the molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies revealed that DH-18 formed strong bidentate chelation with the catalytic Zn2+ ion through the hydroxamate zinc binding group (ZBG).

Extensive experiments on three types of downstream PPI property prediction tasks demonstrate that at the CG-scale, MCGLPPI achieves competitive performance compared with the counterparts at the atom- and residue-scale, but with only a third of computational resource consumption. Furthermore, CG-scale pre-training on protein domain-domain interaction structures enhances its predictive capabilities for PPI tasks. MCGLPPI offers an effective and efficient solution for PPI overall property predictions, serving as a promising tool for the large-scale analysis of biomolecular interactions.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e339d5c6ac4701e21ed9f2105c526758e4b65ec,"MCGLPPI, a novel geometric representation learning framework that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) with the MARTINI molecular coarse-grained (CG) model to predict overall PPI properties accurately and efficiently, offers an effective and efficient solution for PPI overall property predictions.",Y.

Currently, many clinically approved cyclic peptides are derived from natural products or their derivatives, and the development of molecular docking techniques for cyclic peptide discovery holds great promise for expanding the applications and potential of this class of molecules. Given the availability of numerous docking programs, there is a pressing need for a systematic evaluation of their performance, specifically on protein-cyclic peptide systems. In this study, we constructed an extensive benchmark data set called CPSet, consisting of 493 protein-cyclic peptide complexes. Based on this data set, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 10 docking programs, including Rosetta, AutoDock CrankPep, and eight protein-small molecule docking programs (i.e., AutoDock, AudoDock Vina, Glide, GOLD, LeDock, rDock, MOE, and Surflex). The evaluation encompassed the assessment of the sampling power, docking power, and scoring power of these programs. The results revealed that all of the tested protein-small molecule docking programs successfully sampled the binding conformations when using the crystal conformations as the initial structures. Among them, rDock exhibited outstanding performance, achieving a remarkable 94.3% top-100 sampling success rate. However, few programs achieved successful predictions of the binding conformations using tLEaP-generated conformations as the initial structures. Within this scheme, AutoDock CrankPep yielded the highest top-100 sampling success rate of 29.6%. Rosetta's scoring function outperformed the others in selecting optimal conformations, resulting in an impressive top-1 docking success rate of 87.6%. Nevertheless, all the tested scoring functions displayed limited performance in predicting binding affinity, with MOE@Affinity dG exhibiting the highest Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.378.

Medical studies from Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) informed change in military prehospital medicine by influencing widespread tourniquet distribution and training on their use to stop life-threatening extremity hemorrhage. In the military setting, there has been a significant reduction in preventable death due to extremity exsanguination since the widespread implementation of tourniquets within the Department of Defense. However, noncompressible hemorrhage remains a significant cause of mortality, especially in the prehospital setting. In select patients, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is an adjunct that can be utilized to slow or stop non-compressible hemorrhage until the patient reaches definitive care. However, frontline medical providers face the challenge of reliable, accurate blood pressure measurement in REBOA patients. REBOA, used in conjunction with a small disposable pressure monitor, can bridge the gap in capabilities, creating a more balanced resuscitation and reducing blood product requirements with the added benefit of invasive blood pressure monitoring capability. The authors of this study propose the sustained use and further validation of a small, disposable pressure monitor in REBOA to monitor beat-to-beat variation in both hemodynamically stable and unstable patients and seek to offer a pathway for use in austere environments. Materials and methods Yorkshire swine (n = 4) were selected for partial REBOA (pREBOA) placement and compass transducer measurement in conjunction with a vascular experimental protocol. Appropriate vascular and arterial line access was obtained, hemorrhagic shock was initiated, and REBOA with an in-line Compass™ device (CD) pressure transducer (Centurion Medical Products, Williamston, MI) was used to occlude the aorta. Mean arterial pressures were measured via the CD, recorded, and compared to the control arterial line at hypotensive, normotensive, and hypertensive pressures. Results At hypotensive pressures, 30% of the CD readings fell within 1 mmHg of control arterial line readings, and 52.3% were within 2 mmHg. At normotensive pressures, 46% of the CD readings fell within 1 mmHg of control arterial line readings, and 64.2% were within 2 mmHg. At hypertensive pressures, 60% of the CD readings fell within 1 mmHg of control arterial line readings, and 82% were within 2 mmHg. All CD data points at all pressures were within 8 mmHg of the control arterial line readings. Conclusions In conclusion, the CD is a compact, inexpensive, portable pressure-sensing device that may potentially augment the safety and functionality of the REBOA in trauma patients both at the point of injury and in the hospital. This novel study conducted on four swine subjects demonstrated a remarkable correlation to the traditional equipment intensive arterial line setups, and issues of stasis and non-pulsatility were easily troubleshot. Future studies should investigate CD use in REBOA catheters under different physiological conditions, specifically arrhythmias, and in different environments (prehospital, air medical transport, and austere locations).",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c1a315a40a2c80de71e36259e908ed39bdfe652,,G.

Although this feature has been widely used in organometallics to develop homogeneous catalysts, a single-atom heterogeneous analogue has not yet been reported. In this work, we show that a 16-electron complex may act as an important transition state in the CO oxidation over a single Pt atom supported by a MoS2 monolayer (Pt/MoS2). The catalytic oxidation reaction prefers to start with the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) reaction, where the CO and O2 molecules are first co-adsorbed on the Pt atom, then cross a small barrier of 0.40 eV to form a square-planar 16-electron intermediate state, and subsequently the first CO2 is released. The activation barrier of the following Eley–Rideal (E–R) reaction is only 0.23 eV. The superior catalytic reactivity of the Pt/MoS2 surface can be explained by the quantum confinement effect of the Pt-5d orbitals and the stability of the square-planar 16-electron transition state. In addition, MoS2 may serve as a defect-free two dimensional anchoring substrate for Pt atomic adsorption. It provides not only a very large surface-to-volume ratio, but also a well-defined structure with a uniform distribution of anchoring points. The square-planar 16-electron intermediate state of the L–H reaction, together with the new MoS2 anchoring substrate, may provide a new opportunity for the design of single-atom catalysts on two-dimensional surfaces.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1cdebbe17be0a302b98c1f492a935766512d7277,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell-free enzymatic studies showed that C98 inhibited all class I PI3Ks at nano- or low micromolar concentrations but had no effects on AKT or mTOR activity. Molecular docking analysis revealed that C98 interfered with the ATP-binding pockets of PI3Ks by forming H-bonds and arene-H interactions with specific amino acid residues. The cellular assays demonstrated that C98 specifically inhibited PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, but had no effects on other kinases and proteins including IGF-1R, ERK, p38, c-Src, PTEN, and STAT3. Inhibition of PI3K by C98 led to myeloma cell apoptosis. Furthermore, oral administration of C98 delayed tumor growth in two independent human myeloma xenograft models in nude mice but did not show overt toxicity.

However, how GO interacts with bioactive proteins and its potential in enzyme engineering have been rarely explored. In this study, we investigate the interactions between ChT and graphene/GO by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. We find that ChT is adsorbed onto the surface of GO or graphene during 100 ns MD simulations. The α-helix of ChT plays as an important anchor to interact with GO. The cationic and hydrophobic residues of ChT form strong interactions with GO, which leads to the deformation of the active site of ChT and the inhibition of ChT. In comparison, the active site of ChT is only slightly affected after ChT adsorbed onto the graphene surface. In addition, the secondary structure of ChT is not affected after it is adsorbed onto GO or graphene surface.

To decipher the binding specificity of PDZ domain, we analyzed the interactions between 11 mouse PDZ domains and 217 [corrected] peptides using a method called MIEC-SVM, which energetically characterizes the domain-peptide interaction using molecular interaction energy components (MIECs) and predicts binding specificity using support vector machine (SVM). Cross-validation and leave-one-domain-out test showed that the MIEC-SVM using all 44 PDZ-peptide residue pairs at the interaction interface outperformed the sequence-based methods in the literature. A further feature (residue pair) selection procedure illustrated that 16 residue pairs were uninformative to the binding specificity, even though they contributed significantly (~50%) to the binding energy. If only using the 28 informative residue pairs, the performance of the MIEC-SVM on predicting the PDZ binding specificity was significantly improved. This analysis suggests that the informative and uninformative residue interactions between the PDZ domain and the peptide may represent those contributing to binding specificity and affinity, respectively.

Clioquinol Arrests Cell Cycle at G1 Phase and Triggers Intrinsic Apoptosis In Myeloma and Leukemia Cells by Inhibiting Histone Deacetylases,"Biyin Cao, Tingjun Hou, Suning Chen, Depei Wu, Aining Sun, Huiying Qiu, Wenjie Wang, Aaron Schimmer, Xinliang Mao",2010,0,{},"Blood, The Journal of the American Society of Hematology 116 (21), 1836-1836, 2010",,116,21,1836-1836,American Society of Hematology,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zOzb2M-iDCAJ:scholar.google.com/,eaaedd31f972eeab4950b10691b4167d4f7d72fc,0.0,0.0,False,,Review,2010-11-19,"1836 Clioquinol (5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline, CQ) is an old and effective antifungal and amoebicidal drug but is restricted or discontinued in some countries because of its suspect causality in inducing subacute myelo-optic neuropathy, however it has been recently revitalized as an anti-cancer drug candidate at both in vitro and in vivo models. Our previous study suggested that CQ induced cell death and displayed anti-leukemia and anti-myeloma activity (Mao × et al, Leukemia, 2009), but its mechanisms are not well known. In this study, we demonstrated that clioquinol-induced cell death is via intrinsic rather than extrinsic apoptotic pathway, clioquinol-induced apoptosis depends on the activation of caspase-9 and -3. Because zinc is essential for the enzymatic activity of histone deacetylases (HDAC) which is currently emerging as a novel target for apoptotis and cancer treatment, and clioquinol is a strong chelator of zinc ion, we questioned whether clioquinol could interfere with HDAC activity by binding to zinc. Thus, we first examined the effects of clioquinol on the most often used hallmarks for HDAC inhibitions, including cyclin D, p21(CIP1), and p27(KIP1) (Nature Reviews Cancer, 2006). DNA microarray analysis indicated that clioquinol and its analogs significantly up-regulated the transcriptional level of p21 > 2–10 folds within 24 hr. The increased expression of p21(CIP1) protein was further confirmed by western blotting assay in various cell lines and primary patient samples. Clioquinol induced p21(CIP1) expression at concentrations as low as 5 μM witin 24 hr. At the same concentration, tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulator p27 (KIP1) was also increased. In addition, clioquinol also down-regulated expression of D-cyclins, including cyclin D2 and D3 in tested cell lines at a concentration consistent with that induced cell apoptosis. All these changes by clioquinol resulted in cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in both leukemia and myeloma cell lines. Because these genes (cyclin D, p21 and p27) are most associated with histone acetylases, we next checked whether clioquinol is effective in inhibiting HDAC activity. Both leukemia and myeloma cell lines and primary patient samples were applied for the analysis of acetylation status of histone 3 (Ac-H3). Using trichostatin A (TSA) as a positive control, we found that clioquinol accumulated Ac-H3 in all tested cell lines and primary patient samples in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which strongly suggested that clioquinol interfere with HDAC activity. Subsequently, we analyzed the interaction of clioquinol and HDAC. Just like TSA, clioquinol was docked into the active pocket of HDAC, where clioquinol competitively binds to zinc at the active center, which was confirmed by zinc addition. Zinc addition partially abolished the effects of clioquinol on HDAC activity. Thus, our study indicated that clioquinol-induced cell death in both leukemia and myeloma was via an apoptotic pathway by interfering with HDAC activity.

However, the experimental measurement of such an important property is a costly and highly time consuming step of the drug development process because it is necessary to synthesize the compound first. Therefore, in silico modelling of intestinal absorption, which can be carried out at very early stages of drug design, is an appealing alternative procedure which is based mainly on multivariate statistical analysis such as partial least squares (PLS) and neural networks (NN). Our implementation of neural network models for the prediction of intestinal absorption is based on the correlation of Caco-2 cell apparent permeability (P (app)) values, as a measure of intestinal absorption, to the structures of two different data sets of drug candidates. Several molecular descriptors of the compounds were calculated and the optimal subsets were selected using a genetic algorithm; therefore, the method was indicated as Genetic Algorithm-Neural Network (GA-NN). A methodology combining a genetic algorithm search with neural network analysis applied to the modelling of Caco-2 P (app) has never been presented before, although the two procedures have been already employed separately. Moreover, we provide new Caco-2 cell permeability measurements for more than two hundred compounds. Interestingly, the selected descriptors show to possess physico-chemical connotations which are in excellent accordance with the well known relevant molecular properties involved in the cellular membrane permeation phenomenon: hydrophilicity, hydrogen bonding propensity, hydrophobicity and molecular size. The predictive ability of the models, although rather good for a preliminary study, is somewhat affected by the poor precision of the experimental Caco-2 measurements. Finally, the generalization ability of one model was checked on an external test set not derived from the data sets used to build the models. The result obtained is of interesting practical application and underlines that the successful model construction is strictly dependent on the structural space representation of the data set used for model development.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cd6a1ba17f2d38440b9e85b0936f29413eea2e8d,,A.

The final structure of the aqueous simulation at room temperature matches closely the structure obtained by NMR and the experimentally observed protections from isotopic exchange. The comparison of the structures generated by the aqueous simulation at 85 degrees C reveals a trajectory composed of groups of geometrically related structures separated by narrow regions of rapid change in structure. The first of these regions displays changes in backbone rmsd to the crystal structure and solvent-accessible area suggestive of a transition state, while the properties observed during the final 300 ps of the simulation are consistent with a stable intermediate. These assignments were confirmed by calculation of the ""progress along the reaction coordinate"" phi-values using an empirical equation based on a linear response method. The pathway of unfolding defined in this fashion agrees well with the experimental results of site-directed mutagenesis in terms of secondary structure content of the transition state and the intermediate and reproduces the relative stability of the different elements of secondary structure. The results of the simulations in urea suggest a mechanism at the molecular level for its well-known enhancement of the denaturation of proteins. The analysis of radial distribution functions shows that the first solvation shell of the protein is enriched in urea relative to the bulk solvent. The displacement of water molecules allows greater exposure of hydrophobic side chains, as witnessed particularly in the analysis of solvent-accessible surface areas at the higher temperature. Almost all urea molecules in the first shell form at least one hydrogen bond with the protein. They provide a more favorable environment for accommodation of the remaining water molecules, and they facilitate the separation of secondary structure elements by acting as a bridge between groups previously forming intraprotein hydrogen bonds.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0015e1418f19a728836f06bf77c7c3ee7a4abb9b,,J.

IL-11 acts on cells expressing gp130 and the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R) alpha-subunit (IL-11Ralpha). The structural epitopes of IL-11 required for the recruitment of the individual receptor subunits have not yet been defined. Based on the structure of CNTF, a three-dimensional model of human IL-11 was built. Using this model, 10 surface exposed amino acid residues of IL-11 were selected for mutagenesis using analogies to the well-characterized receptor recruitment sites of IL-6, CNTF, and LIF. The respective mutants of human IL-11 were expressed as soluble fusion proteins in bacteria. Their biological activities were determined on HepG2 and Ba/F3-130-11alpha cells. Several mutants with substantially decreased bioactivity and one hyperagonistic mutant were identified and further analyzed with regard to recruitment of IL-11Ralpha and gp130. The low-activity mutant I171D still binds IL-11Ralpha but fails to recruit gp130, whereas the hyperagonistic variant R135E more efficiently engages the IL-11R subunits. The low-activity mutants R190E and L194D failed to bind to IL-11Ralpha. These findings reveal a common mechanism of receptor recruitment in the family of IL-6-type cytokines and offer considerable perspectives for the rational design of IL-11 antagonists and hyperagonists.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2dd078a76183dbac85a3d8a44c6707680765afbe,A molecular model of IL-11 is generated using the X-ray structure of GCSF as a template and the information from the secondary structural prediction of the GOR_II method was taken into account and the validation of the model suggests that the quality of this structure is sound.,I.

Here, we investigate strategies for applying COMBINE (COMparative BINding Energy) analysis, in conjunction with PIPSA (Protein Interaction Property Similarity Analysis) and ligand docking methods, to address this problem. We evaluate these approaches by application to diverse sets of inhibitors of three structurally related serine proteases of medical relevance: thrombin, trypsin, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). We generated target-specific scoring functions (COMBINE models) for the three targets using training sets of ligands with known inhibition constants and structures of their receptor-ligand complexes. These COMBINE models were compared with the PIPSA results and experimental data on receptor selectivity. These scoring functions highlight the ligand-receptor interactions that are particularly important for binding specificity for the different targets. To predict target selectivity in virtual screening, compounds were docked into the three protein binding sites using the program GOLD and the docking solutions were re-ranked with the target-specific scoring functions and computed electrostatic binding free energies. Limits in the accuracy of some of the docking solutions and difficulties in scoring them adversely affected the predictive ability of the target specific scoring functions.

Compared to traditional ML, DL models have provided significant improvements across many domains and applications. In this work, we examine DL applications in genomics, transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and multi-omics integration, and address whether DL techniques will prove to be advantageous or if the single-cell omics domain poses unique challenges. Through a systematic literature review, we have found that DL has not yet revolutionized the most pressing challenges of the single-cell omics field. However, using DL models for single-cell omics has shown promising results (in many cases outperforming the previous state-of-the-art models) in data preprocessing and downstream analysis. Although developments of DL algorithms for single-cell omics have generally been gradual, recent advances reveal that DL can offer valuable resources in fast-tracking and advancing research in single-cell.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e6341a5bfcce05a3ea51e339f32a0a858e6a61e7,"From the calculation results, a group of QSAR models with high predictive ability can be obtained, which are superior than that one using conventional CoMFA; meanwhile, the active comformers for these compounds in dataset can be determined from the best model.",N.

However, most current applications of LLMs in drug discovery lack the ability to comprehend three-dimensional (3D) structures, thereby limiting their effectiveness in tasks that explicitly involve molecular conformations. In this study, we introduced Token-Mol, a token-only 3D drug design model. This model encodes all molecular information, including 2D and 3D structures, as well as molecular property data, into tokens, which transforms classification and regression tasks in drug discovery into probabilistic prediction problems, thereby enabling learning through a unified paradigm. Token-Mol is built on the transformer decoder architecture and trained using random causal masking techniques. Additionally, we proposed the Gaussian cross-entropy (GCE) loss function to overcome the challenges in regression tasks, significantly enhancing the capacity of LLMs to learn continuous numerical values. Through a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), Token-Mol achieves performance comparable to or surpassing existing task-specific methods across various downstream tasks, including pocket-based molecular generation, conformation generation, and molecular property prediction. Compared to existing molecular pre-trained models, Token-Mol exhibits superior proficiency in handling a wider range of downstream tasks essential for drug design. Notably, our approach improves regression task accuracy by approximately 30% compared to similar token-only methods.

Recently, the crystal structure of the vcCNT (Vibrio cholerae Concentrative Nucleoside Transporter) was reported. Here we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the vcCNT structure in the presence of various sodium gradients, since CNTs are sodium-coupled transporters.

In the presence of 20 mM NaCl, uridine moves from the binding pocket and approaches the entrance of the intracellular side. In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, uridine passes through most part of the entrance and approaches the intracellular side. The polar/charged amino acids in the binding pocket are important in the transport process.

Recently, the discovery of inhibitors that block a single isoform of PI3K has continued to attract special attention because they may have higher selectivity for certain tumors and less toxicity for healthy cells. The PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ share fewer studies than α/γ, and therefore, in this work, the combination of molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations was employed to explore the binding of three isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors (COM8, IC87114, and GDC-0941) to PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ. The isoform specificities of the studied inhibitors derived from the predicted binding free energies are in good agreement with the experimental data. In addition, the key residues critical for PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ selectivity were highlighted by decomposing the binding free energies into the contributions from individual residues. It was observed that although PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ share the conserved ATP-binding pockets, individual residues do behave differently, particularly the residues critical for PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ selectivity. It can be concluded that the inhibitor specificity between PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ is determined by the additive contributions from multiple residues, not just a single one.

The novel type-I1/2 inhibitors display excellent antiproliferation activity against ALK-positive cancer cells and appear superior to two clinically used drugs, crizotinib and ceritinib. Structural and molecular modeling analyses indicate that the inhibitor induces dramatic conformational transition and stabilizes unique DFG-shifted loop conformation, enabling persistent sensitivity to different genetic mutations in ALK. These data highlight a rationale for further development of next-generation ALK inhibitors to combat drug resistance.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/738b94fef4c684632180cec6db4c958265fb898e,"Structural and molecular modeling analyses indicate that the inhibitor induces dramatic conformational transition and stabilizes unique DFG-shifted loop conformation, enabling persistent sensitivity to different genetic mutations in ALK, highlighting a rationale for further development of next-generation ALK inhibitors to combat drug resistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The absence of novel, potent and selective inhibitors severely hampers the understanding of the therapeutic potential of Tie-2. In the present work, we describe the discovery of novel type-I inhibitors of Tie-2 by structure-based virtual screening. Preliminary SAR was also performed based on one active compound, and several novel inhibitors with low micro-molar affinity were discovered. To directly compare the efficiency between different filtering strategies in selecting VS candidates, two methods were separately carried out to screen the same chemical library, and the selected VS candidates were then experimentally assessed by in vitro enzymatic assays. The results demonstrate that the hit rate is improved when stricter drug-likeness criteria and less number of molecules for clustering analysis are used, and meanwhile, the molecular diversity of the compounds still maintains. As a case study of TIE-2, the information presented in this work underscores the importance of selecting an appropriate selection strategy in VS campaign, and the novel inhibitors identified and the detailed binding modes of action provide a starting point for further hit-to-lead optimization process.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e34e3b4b1aa6b32562c8903a3f5ee15d3cdd38ef,"The discovery of novel type-I inhibitors of Tie-2 by structure-based virtual screening underscores the importance of selecting an appropriate selection strategy in VS campaign, and the novel inhibitors identified and the detailed binding modes of action provide a starting point for further hit-to-lead optimization process.",P.

Targeting PI3K is emerging as a promising strategy in the treatment of these blood cancers. Recent approval of idelalisib, a specific inhibitor of PI3Kδ, for the treatment of several types of HM, is likely to attract more interest in search for novel PI3K inhibitors. Here, we discuss classic and cutting-edge techniques and strategies to identify PI3K inhibitors for the treatment of HM.

The first main finding is that the ＂one client served by one steward＂ individualized services model follows the workfare governance principle of requiring the unemployed to performed job-search obligations before receiving unemployment benefits, as a means of control. The second main finding is that the individualized services model was designed with three mechanisms which require unemployment benefit applicants to undertake greater job-search obligations and related counseling. They must make an appointment to manage jobsearch time, carry out greater job-search obligations according to unemployment identity rules, and receive individualized early-intervention employment counseling. As a result, unemployment benefit applicants fall into the situation of passive participation, resulting in decreased autonomy for unemployment benefit applicants because they just passively receive job-search guidelines from the state.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/94b637872d5fcbd7c47fc5ab407571f97cc215d0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
