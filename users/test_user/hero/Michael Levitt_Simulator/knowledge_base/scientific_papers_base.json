Recent progress in Transformer-based architectures has enabled the implementation of language models capable of generating text with human-like capabilities. Here, motivated by this success, we describe ProtGPT2, a language model trained on the protein space that generates de novo protein sequences following the principles of natural ones. The generated proteins display natural amino acid propensities, while disorder predictions indicate that 88% of ProtGPT2-generated proteins are globular, in line with natural sequences. Sensitive sequence searches in protein databases show that ProtGPT2 sequences are distantly related to natural ones, and similarity networks further demonstrate that ProtGPT2 is sampling unexplored regions of protein space. AlphaFold prediction of ProtGPT2-sequences yields well-folded non-idealized structures with embodiments and large loops and reveals topologies not captured in current structure databases. ProtGPT2 generates sequences in a matter of seconds and is freely available.",

However, use of anti-Tac as an immunosuppressant drug would be impaired by the human immune response against this murine antibody. We have therefore constructed a \"humanized\" antibody by combining the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the anti-Tac antibody with human framework and constant regions. The human framework regions were chosen to maximize homology with the anti-Tac antibody sequence. In addition, a computer model of murine anti-Tac was used to identify several amino acids which, while outside the CDRs, are likely to interact with the CDRs or antigen. These mouse amino acids were also retained in the humanized antibody. The humanized anti-Tac antibody has an affinity for p55 of 3 x 10(9) M-1, about 1/3 that of murine anti-Tac.",

It assumes that folding occurs through organizing an ensemble of structures rather than through only a few uniquely defined structural intermediates. It suggests that the most realistic model of a protein is a minimally frustrated heteropolymer with a rugged funnel-like landscape biased toward the native structure. This statistical description has been developed using tools from the statistical mechanics of disordered systems, polymers, and phase transitions of finite systems. We review here its analytical background and contrast the phenomena in homopolymers, random heteropolymers, and protein-like heteropolymers that are kinetically and thermodynamically capable of folding. The connection between these statistical concepts and the results of minimalist models used in computer simulations is discussed. The review concludes with a brief discussion of how the theory helps in the interpretation of results from fast folding experiments and in the practical task of protein structure prediction.",

To locate the cross-linker modification, dedicated software is applied to analyze the mass or tandem mass spectra (MS/MS). Such software requires information on target amino acids to limit the data analysis time. The most commonly used homobifunctional N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS) esters are often described as reactive exclusively towards primary amines, although side reactions with tyrosine and serine have been reported. Our goal was to systematically study the reactivity of NHS esters and derive some general rules for their attack of nucleophilic amino acid side chains in peptides. We therefore studied the cross-linking reactions of synthesized and commercial model peptides with disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS). The first reaction site in all cases was expectedly the alpha-NH(2)-group of the N-terminus or the epsilon-NH(2)-group of lysine. As soon as additional cross-linkers were attached or loops were formed, other amino acids were also involved in the reaction. In addition to the primary amino groups, serine, threonine and tyrosine showed significant reactivity due to the effect of neighboring amino acids by intermediate or permanent Type-1 cross-link formation. The reactivity is highly dependent on the pH and on adjacent amino acids.",

This method, normal-mode dynamics, is particularly well suited for modelling collective motion, makes possible direct visualization of biologically interesting modes, and is complementary to the more time-consuming simulation of molecular dynamics trajectories. The essential assumption and limitation of normal-mode analysis is that the molecular potential energy varies quadratically. Our study starts with energy minimization of the X-ray co-ordinates with respect to the single-bond torsion angles. The main technical task is the calculation of second derivative matrices of kinetic and potential energy with respect to the torsion angle co-ordinates. These enter into a generalized eigenvalue problem, and the final eigenvalues and eigenvectors provide a complete description of the motion in the basic 0.1 to 10 picosecond range. Thermodynamic averages of amplitudes, fluctuations and correlations can be calculated efficiently using analytical formulae. The general method presented here is applied to four proteins, trypsin inhibitor, crambin, ribonuclease and lysozyme. When the resulting atomic motion is visualized by computer graphics, it is clear that the motion of each protein is collective with all atoms participating in each mode. The slow modes, with frequencies of below 10 cm-1 (a period of 3 ps), are the most interesting in that the motion in these modes is segmental. The root-mean-square atomic fluctuations, which are dominated by a few slow modes, agree well with experimental temperature factors (B values). The normal-mode dynamics of these four proteins have many features in common, although in the larger molecules, lysozyme and ribonuclease, there is low frequency domain motion about the active site.",

This interaction, which is about half as strong as a normal hydrogen bond, contributes approximately 3 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184 J) of stabilizing enthalpy and is expected to play a significant role in molecular associations. It is of interest that the aromatic hydrogen bond arises from small partial charges centred on the ring carbon and hydrogen atoms: there is no need to consider delocalized electrons. Although some energy calculations have included such partial charges, their role in forming such a strong interaction was not appreciated until after aromatic hydrogen bonds had been observed in protein-drug complexes.",

Nineteen of these amino acids have a weak but statistically signficant preference for only on type of secondary structure. These preferences correlate well with the chemical structure of the particular amino acids giving a more objective classification of the conformational properties of amino acids than available before.",

        "abstract": "Segment match modeling uses a data base of highly refined known protein X-ray structures to build an unknown target structure from its amino acid sequence and the atomic coordinates of a few of its atoms (generally only the C alpha atoms). The target structure is first broken into a set of short segments. The data base is then searched for matching segments, which are fitted onto the framework of the target structure. Three criteria are used for choosing a matching data base segment: amino acid sequence similarity, conformational similarity (atomic co-ordinates), and compatibility with the target structure (van der Waals' interactions). The new method works surprisingly well: for eight test proteins ranging in size from 46 to 323 residues, the all-atom root-mean-square deviation of the modeled structures is between 0.93 A and 1.73 A (the average is 1.26 A). Deviations of this magnitude are comparable with those found for protein co-ordinates before and after refinement against X-ray data or for co-ordinates of the same protein in different crystal packings. These results are insensitive to errors in the C alpha positions or to missing C alpha atoms: accurate models can be built with C alpha errors of up to 1 A or by using only half the C alpha atoms. The fit to the X-ray structures is improved significantly by building several independent models based on different random choices and then averaging co-ordinates; this novel concept has general implications for other modeling tasks. The segment match modeling method is fully automatic, yields a complete set of atomic co-ordinates without any human intervention and is efficient (14 s/residue on the Silicon Graphics 4D/25 Personal Iris workstation.",

        "abstract": "The fold of a helical membrane protein is largely determined by interactions between membrane-imbedded helices. To elucidate recurring helix-helix interaction motifs, we dissected the crystallographic structures of membrane proteins into a library of interacting helical pairs. The pairs were clustered according to their three-dimensional similarity (rmsd </=1.5 A), allowing 90% of the library to be assigned to clusters consisting of at least five members. Surprisingly, three quarters of the helical pairs belong to one of five tightly clustered motifs whose structural features can be understood in terms of simple principles of helix-helix packing. Thus, the universe of common transmembrane helix-pairing motifs is relatively simple. The largest cluster, which comprises 29% of the library members, consists of an antiparallel motif with left-handed packing angles, and it is frequently stabilized by packing of small side chains occurring every seven residues in the sequence. Right-handed parallel and antiparallel structures show a similar tendency to segregate small residues to the helix-helix interface but spaced at four-residue intervals. Position-specific sequence propensities were derived for the most populated motifs. These structural and sequential motifs should be quite useful for the design and structural prediction of membrane proteins.",

The model is further tested by comparing calculated energetic, structural, and dynamic properties of liquid water, at several temperatures and pressures, with experiment. The F3C model is extremely simple and fits experimental data well for different temperatures, pressures, system sizes, and integration time steps.

These give compact self-avoiding conformations each constrained to have native secondary structure. Ensembles of these decoy conformations were used to test the ability of several types of empirical contact, surface area and distance-dependent energy functions to distinguish between correct and incorrect conformations. These tests have shown that none of the functions is able to distinguish consistently either the X-ray conformation or the near-native conformations from others which are incorrect. Certain combinations of two of these energy functions were able, however, consistently to identify X-ray structures from amongst the decoy conformations. These same combinations are better also at identifying near-native conformations, consistently finding them with a hundred-fold higher frequency than chance. The fact that these combination energy functions perform better than generally accepted energy functions suggests their future use in folding simulations and perhaps threading predictions.",

Transfer of the 5' splice site (5'SS) from U1 to U6 snRNA triggers unwinding of U6 snRNA from U4 snRNA. U6 folds with U2 snRNA into an RNA-based active site that positions the 5'SS at two catalytic metal ions. The branch point (BP) adenosine attacks the 5'SS, producing a free 5' exon. Removal of the BP adenosine from the active site allows the 3'SS to bind, so that the 5' exon attacks the 3'SS to produce mature mRNA and an excised lariat intron.",

Twenty-five random starting structures are subjected to soft-atom restrained energy minimization with respect to both the torsion angles and the atomic Cartesian co-ordinates. The restraints used to limit the search include the three disulphide bridges and the 16 main-chain hydrogen bonds that define the native secondary structure. The potential energy functions used are detailed and include terms that allow bond stretching, bond angle bending, bond twisting, van der Waals' forces and hydrogen bonds. Novel features of the methods used include soft-atoms to make restrained energy minimization work, writhing numbers to classify chain threadings, and molecular dynamics followed by energy minimization to anneal the conformations and reduce their energies further. Conformations are analysed using writhing numbers, torsion angle distributions, hydrogen bonds and accessible surface areas. The resulting conformations are very diverse in their chain threadings, energies and root-mean-square deviations from the X-ray structure. There is a relationship between the root-mean-square deviation and the energy, in that the lowest energy conformations are also closest to the X-ray structure. The best conformation calculated here has a root-mean-square deviation of only 3 A and shows the same special threading found in the X-ray structure. The methods introduced here have wide ranging applications; they can be used to build models of protein conformations that have low energy values and obey a wide variety of restraints.",

Doing so involves an all-vs.-all comparison of protein domains [taken here from the Structural Classification of Proteins (scop) database] and then fitting a simple distribution function to the observed scores. By using this distribution, we can attach a statistical significance to each comparison score in the form of a P value, the probability that a better score would occur by chance. As expected, we find that the scores for sequence matching follow an extreme-value distribution. The agreement, moreover, between the P values that we derive from this distribution and those reported by standard programs (e.g., BLAST and FASTA validates our approach. Structure comparison scores also follow an extreme-value distribution when the statistics are expressed in terms of a structural alignment score (essentially the sum of reciprocated distances between aligned atoms minus gap penalties). We find that the traditional metric of structural similarity, the rms deviation in atom positions after fitting aligned atoms, follows a different distribution of scores and does not perform as well as the structural alignment score. Comparison of the sequence and structure statistics for pairs of proteins known to be related distantly shows that structural comparison is able to detect approximately twice as many distant relationships as sequence comparison at the same error rate. The comparison also indicates that there are very few pairs with significant similarity in terms of sequence but not structure whereas many pairs have significant similarity in terms of structure but not sequence.",

The new cysteines spontaneously formed disulfide bonds on exposure to air in vitro. In all cases the oxidized (crosslinked) lysozyme was more stable than the corresponding reduced (noncrosslinked) enzyme toward thermal denaturation. Relative to wild-type lysozyme, the melting temperatures of the 9-164 and 21-142 disulfide mutants were increased by 6.4 degrees C and 11.0 degrees C, whereas the other two mutants were either less stable or equally stable. Measurement of the equilibrium constants for the reduction of the engineered disulfide bonds by dithiothreitol indicates that the less thermostable mutants tend to have a less favorable crosslink in the native structure. The two disulfide bridges that are most effective in increasing the stability of T4 lysozyme have, in common, a large loop size and a location that includes a flexible part of the molecule. The results suggest that stabilization due to the effect of the crosslink on the entropy of the unfolded polypeptide is offset by the strain energy associated with formation of the disulfide bond in the folded protein.

        "abstract": "We report the largest and most comprehensive comparison of protein structural alignment methods. Specifically, we evaluate six publicly available structure alignment programs: SSAP, STRUCTAL, DALI, LSQMAN, CE and SSM by aligning all 8,581,970 protein structure pairs in a test set of 2930 protein domains specially selected from CATH v.2.4 to ensure sequence diversity. We consider an alignment good if it matches many residues, and the two substructures are geometrically similar. Even with this definition, evaluating structural alignment methods is not straightforward. At first, we compared the rates of true and false positives using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with the CATH classification taken as a gold standard. This proved unsatisfactory in that the quality of the alignments is not taken into account: sometimes a method that finds less good alignments scores better than a method that finds better alignments. We correct this intrinsic limitation by using four different geometric match measures (SI, MI, SAS, and GSAS) to evaluate the quality of each structural alignment. With this improved analysis we show that there is a wide variation in the performance of different methods; the main reason for this is that it can be difficult to find a good structural alignment between two proteins even when such an alignment exists. We find that STRUCTAL and SSM perform best, followed by LSQMAN and CE. Our focus on the intrinsic quality of each alignment allows us to propose a new method, called \"Best-of-All\" that combines the best results of all methods. Many commonly used methods miss 10-50% of the good Best-of-All alignments. By putting existing structural alignments into proper perspective, our study allows better comparison of protein structures. By highlighting limitations of existing methods, it will spur the further development of better structural alignment methods. This will have significant biological implications now that structural comparison has come to play a central role in the analysis of experimental work on protein structure, protein function and protein evolution.",

The method compares two input profiles (like those that are generated by PSI-BLAST) and assigns a similarity score to assess their statistical similarity. Our profile-profile comparison tool, which allows for gaps, can be used to detect weak similarities between protein families. It has also been optimized to produce alignments that are in very good agreement with structural alignments. Tests show that the profile-profile alignments are indeed highly correlated with similarities between secondary structure elements and tertiary structure. Exhaustive evaluations show that our method is significantly more sensitive in detecting distant homologies than the popular profile-based search programs PSI-BLAST and IMPALA. The relative improvement is the same order of magnitude as the improvement of PSI-BLAST relative to BLAST. Our new tool often detects similarities that fall within the twilight zone of sequence similarity.",

Sequence-based predictions of protein structures have increased in accuracy1, and over 214 million predicted structures are available in the AlphaFold database2. However, studying protein structures at this scale requires highly efficient methods. Here, we developed a structural-alignment-based clustering algorithm-Foldseek cluster-that can cluster hundreds of millions of structures. Using this method, we have clustered all of the structures in the AlphaFold database, identifying 2.30 million non-singleton structural clusters, of which 31% lack annotations representing probable previously undescribed structures. Clusters without annotation tend to have few representatives covering only 4% of all proteins in the AlphaFold database. Evolutionary analysis suggests that most clusters are ancient in origin but 4% seem to be species specific, representing lower-quality predictions or examples of de novo gene birth. We also show how structural comparisons can be used to predict domain families and their relationships, identifying examples of remote structural similarity. On the basis of these analyses, we identify several examples of human immune-related proteins with putative remote homology in prokaryotic species, illustrating the value of this resource for studying protein function and evolution across the tree of life.",

        "abstract": "We analyze the volume of atoms on the protein surface during a molecular-dynamics simulation of a small protein (pancreatic trypsin inhibitor). To calculate volumes, we use a particular geometric construction, called Voronoi polyhedra, that divides the total volume of the simulation box amongst the atoms, rendering them relatively larger or smaller depending on how tightly they are packed. We find that most of the atoms on the protein surface are larger than those buried in the core (by approximately 6%), except for the charged atoms, which decrease in size, presumably due to electroconstriction. We also find that water molecules are larger near apolar atoms on the protein surface and smaller near charged atoms, in comparison to \"bulk\" water molecules far from the protein. Taken together, these findings necessarily imply that apolar atoms on the protein surface and their associated water molecules are less tightly packed (than corresponding atoms in the protein core and bulk water) and the opposite is the case for charged atoms. This looser apolar packing and tighter charged packing fundamentally reflects protein-water distances that are larger or smaller than those expected from van der Waals radii. In addition to the calculation of mean volumes, simulations allow us to investigate the volume fluctuations and hence compressibilities of the protein and solvent atoms. The relatively large volume fluctuations of atoms at the protein-water interface indicates that they have a more variable packing than corresponding atoms in the protein core or in bulk water. We try to adhere to traditional conventions throughout our calculations. Nevertheless, we are aware of and discuss three complexities that significantly qualify our calculations: the positioning of the dividing plane between atoms, the problem of vertex error, and the choice of atom radii. In particular, our results highlight how poor a \"compromise\" the commonly accepted value of 1.4 A is for the radius of a water molecule.",

        "abstract": "X-ray diffraction plays a pivotal role in the understanding of biological systems by revealing atomic structures of proteins, nucleic acids and their complexes, with much recent interest in very large assemblies like the ribosome. As crystals of such large assemblies often diffract weakly (resolution worse than 4 A), we need methods that work at such low resolution. In macromolecular assemblies, some of the components may be known at high resolution, whereas others are unknown: current refinement methods fail as they require a high-resolution starting structure for the entire complex. Determining the structure of such complexes, which are often of key biological importance, should be possible in principle as the number of independent diffraction intensities at a resolution better than 5 A generally exceeds the number of degrees of freedom. Here we introduce a method that adds specific information from known homologous structures but allows global and local deformations of these homology models. Our approach uses the observation that local protein structure tends to be conserved as sequence and function evolve. Cross-validation with R(free) (the free R-factor) determines the optimum deformation and influence of the homology model. For test cases at 3.5-5 A resolution with known structures at high resolution, our method gives significant improvements over conventional refinement in the model as monitored by coordinate accuracy, the definition of secondary structure and the quality of electron density maps. For re-refinements of a representative set of 19 low-resolution crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank, we find similar improvements. Thus, a structure derived from low-resolution diffraction data can have quality similar to a high-resolution structure. Our method is applicable to the study of weakly diffracting crystals using X-ray micro-diffraction as well as data from new X-ray light sources. Use of homology information is not restricted to X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy: as optical imaging advances to subnanometre resolution, it can use similar tools.",

In this paper, we examine the relationship between the complexity and accuracy of representation of various models of protein alpha-carbon backbone structure. First, we develop an efficient algorithm for the near optimal fitting of arbitrary lattice and off-lattice models of polypeptide chains to their true X-ray structures. Using this, we show that the relationship between the complexity of a model, taken as the number of possible conformational states per residue, and the simplest measure of accuracy, the root-mean-square deviation from the X-ray structure, is approximately (Accuracy) varies; is directly proportional to (Complexity)-1/2. This relationship is insensitive to the particularities of individual models, i.e. lattice and off-lattice models of the same complexity tend to have similar average root-mean-square deviations, and this also implies that improvements in model accuracy with increasing complexity are very small. However, other measures of model accuracy, such as the preservation of X-ray residue-residue contacts and the alpha-helix, do distinguish among models. In addition, we show that low complexity models, which take into account the uneven distribution of residue conformations in real proteins, can represent X-ray structures as accurately as more complex models, which do not: a selected 6-state model can represent protein structures almost as accurately (1.7 A root-mean-square) as a 17-state lattice model (1.6 A root-mean-square). Finally, we use a novel optimization procedure to generate eight 4-state models, which fit native proteins to an average of 2.4 A, and preserve 85% of native residue-residue contacts. We discuss the implications of these findings for protein folding and the prediction of protein conformation.",

This allows us to assess, understand, and improve our automatic method against an objective, manually derived standard, a type of comprehensive evaluation that has not yet been possible for other structural alignment algorithms. Our basic approach directly matches the backbones of two structures, using repeated cycles of dynamic programming and least-squares fitting to determine an alignment minimizing coordinate difference. Because of simplicity, our method can be readily modified to take into account additional features of protein structure such as the orientation of side chains or the location-dependent cost of opening a gap. Our basic method, augmented by such modifications, can find reasonable alignments for all but 1.5% of the known structural similarities in scop, i.e., all but 32 of the 2,107 superfamily pairs. We discuss the specific protein structural features that make these 32 pairs so difficult to align and show how our procedure effectively partitions the relationships in scop into different categories, depending on what aspects of protein structure are involved (e.g., depending on whether or not consideration of side-chain orientation is necessary for proper alignment). We also show how our pairwise alignment procedure can be extended to generate a multiple alignment for a group of related structures. We have compared these alignments in detail with corresponding manual ones culled from the literature. We find good agreement (to within 95% for the core regions), and detailed comparison highlights how particular protein structural features (such as certain strands) are problematical to align, giving somewhat ambiguous results. With these improvements and systematic tests, our procedure should be useful for the development of scop and the future classification of protein folds.",

We review a number of topics related to this process. We first describe how the observed packing in protein crystal structures is measured. Such measurements show that the protein interior is packed exceptionally tightly, more so than the protein surface or surrounding solvent and even more efficiently than crystals of simple organic molecules. In vitro protein folding experiments also show that the protein is close-packed in solution and that the tight packing and intercalation of side-chains is a final and essential step in the folding pathway. These experimental observations, in turn, suggest that a folded protein structure can be described as a kind of three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle and that predicting side-chain packing is possible in the sense of solving this puzzle. The major difficulty that must be overcome in predicting side-chain packing is a combinatorial \"explosion\" in the number of possible configurations. There has been much recent progress towards overcoming this problem, and we survey a variety of the approaches. These approaches differ principally in whether they use ab initio (physical) or more knowledge-based methods, how they divide up and search conformational space, and how they evaluate candidate configurations (using scoring functions). The accuracy of side-chain prediction depends crucially on the (assumed) positioning of the main-chain. Methods for predicting main-chain conformation are, in a sense, not as developed as that for side-chains. We conclude by surveying these methods. As with side-chain prediction, there are a great variety of approaches, which differ in how they divide up and search space and in how they score candidate conformations.",

Additionally, we insert the DNA in nanochannels of different widths to study the influence of the confinement on the melting dynamics. Our results suggest that there is no significant difference in the critical temperature or rate of melting when the channel width⩾Rg/2, whereRgis the radius of gyration of DNA. Instead, at channel width ofRg/4 we only see partial denaturation at the free DNA melting temperature. Surprisingly, this trend is reversed at higher temperature, and we find that at 110 °C tight confinement results in faster melting. This is due to the fact that confinement promotes segregation of the single-stranded segment, thereby acting as an effective entropic force aiding denaturation.",

It remains to be determined what is the critical curvature of DNA that prompts the appearance of the kinks. Different experimental and computational approaches to the problem are analyzed. We conclude that there is no reliable evidence that any anomalous behavior of the double helix happens when DNA fragments in the range of 100 bp are circularized without torsional stress. The anomaly starts at the fragment length of about 70 bp when sharp bends or kinks emerge in essentially every molecule. Experimental data and theoretical analysis suggest that kinks may represent openings of isolated base pairs, which had been experimentally detected in linear DNA molecules. The calculation suggests that although the probability of these openings in unstressed DNA is close to 10(-5), it increases sharply in small DNA circles reaching 1 open bp per circle of 70 bp.",

        "abstract": "Prediction of protein structure depends on the accuracy and complexity of the models used. Here, we represent the polypeptide chain by a sequence of rigid fragments that are concatenated without any degrees of freedom. Fragments chosen from a library of representative fragments are fit to the native structure using a greedy build-up method. This gives a one-dimensional representation of native protein three-dimensional structure whose quality depends on the nature of the library. We use a novel clustering method to construct libraries that differ in the fragment length (four to seven residues) and number of representative fragments they contain (25-300). Each library is characterized by the quality of fit (accuracy) and the number of allowed states per residue (complexity). We find that the accuracy depends on the complexity and varies from 2.9A for a 2.7-state model on the basis of fragments of length 7-0.76A for a 15-state model on the basis of fragments of length 5. Our goal is to find representations that are both accurate and economical (low complexity). The models defined here are substantially better in this regard: with ten states per residue we approximate native protein structure to 1A compared to over 20 states per residue needed previously. For the same complexity, we find that longer fragments provide better fits. Unfortunately, libraries of longer fragments must be much larger (for ten states per residue, a seven-residue library is 100 times larger than a five-residue library). As the number of known protein native structures increases, it will be possible to construct larger libraries to better exploit this correlation between neighboring residues. Our fragment libraries, which offer a wide range of optimal fragments suited to different accuracies of fit, may prove to be useful for generating better decoy sets for ab initio protein folding and for generating accurate loop conformations in homology modeling.",

Together, these techniques, many of which have been used before in analyses of protein co-ordinate refinement, give a complete and comprehensible description of the trajectory. Some highlights of the simulation are as follows. (1) The atoms vibrate about a time-averaged conformation that is close to the X-ray structure (within 1.1 A root-mean-square deviation for the main-chain of all residues except the first and last two). The vibration amplitude is least for main-chain atoms in alpha-helix or beta-sheet secondary structure and most for side-chain atoms in the charged polar side-chains (Asp, Glu, Lys and Arg). The overall extent and distribution of atomic motion is in agreement with the temperature factors derived from the X-ray refinement: the reorientation of bond vectors is much less than observed by nuclear magnetic resonance. (2) The protein explores four distinct regions of conformational space in the 132 picoseconds simulated. The conformational change from region III to IV and back again lasts 40 picoseconds and is of particular interest as it is reversible and involves an increase in the hydrogen bond energy. (3) The changes in main-chain torsion angles show the expected cooperativity of phi i + 1 and psi i; side-chains that are close in space also change their conformational angles in unison. (4) Hydrogen bonds are variable and many break and reform again in the 132 picoseconds. Certain hydrogen bonds are much less stable than others; with particular variability seen in the alpha-helices and at the ends of the beta-hairpin. Most noticeable are the co-operative changes of hydrogen bonds at both ends of the beta-hairpin that occur in going from region III to IV of the conformational space. (5) The overall solvent-accessible area remains close to that of the X-ray structure but polar charged residues become less exposed while non-polar hydrophobic residues become more exposed. Together these results give a conceptual model for protein dynamics in which the molecule vibrates about a particular conformation but then suddenly changes conformation, jumping over an energy barrier into a new region of conformational space.",

A combined knowledge-based atomic level energy function is then used to select subsets of the all-atom models. The final predictions are generated using a consensus distance geometry procedure. We test the feasibility of the procedure on a set of 12 small proteins covering a wide range of protein topologies. A rigorous double-blind test of our method was made under the auspices of the CASP3 experiment, where we did ab initio structure predictions for 12 proteins using this approach. The performance of our methodology at CASP3 is reasonably good and completely consistent with our initial tests.",

Microbiota acquired at birth develops in parallel as the host develops and maintains its temporal stability and diversity through adulthood until death. Recent developments in genome sequencing technologies, bioinformatics and culturomics have enabled researchers to explore the microbiota and in particular their functions at more detailed level than before. The accumulated evidences suggest that though a part of the microbiota is conserved, the dynamic members vary along the gastrointestinal tract, from infants to elderly, primitive tribes to modern societies and in different health conditions. Though the gut microbiota is dynamic, it performs some basic functions in the immunological, metabolic, structural and neurological landscapes of the human body. Gut microbiota also exerts significant influence on both physical and mental health of an individual. An in-depth understanding of the functioning of gut microbiota has led to some very exciting developments in therapeutics, such as prebiotics, probiotics, drugs and faecal transplantation leading to improved health.",

The structures were mobile, with overall secondary structure contents comparable to those of the native protein. The protein experienced relatively local unfolding, with the largest changes in the structure occurring in the loop regions. A hydrophobic core was maintained although packing of the side chains was compromised. The properties displayed in the simulation are consistent with unfolding to a molten globule state.

        "abstract": "The TRiC/CCT chaperonin is a 1-MDa hetero-oligomer of 16 subunits that assists the folding of proteins in eukaryotes. Low-resolution structural studies confirmed the TRiC particle to be composed of two stacked octameric rings enclosing a folding cavity. The exact arrangement of the different proteins in the rings underlies the functionality of TRiC and is likely to be conserved across all eukaryotes. Yet despite its importance it has not been determined conclusively, mainly because the different subunits appear nearly identical under low resolution. This work successfully addresses the arrangement problem by the emerging technique of cross-linking, mass spectrometry, and modeling. We cross-linked TRiC under native conditions with a cross-linker that is primarily reactive toward exposed lysine side chains that are spatially close in the context of the particle. Following digestion and mass spectrometry we were able to identify over 60 lysine pairs that underwent cross-linking, thus providing distance restraints between specific residues in the complex. Independently of the cross-link set, we constructed 40,320 (= 8 factorial) computational models of the TRiC particle, which exhaustively enumerate all the possible arrangements of the different subunits. When we assessed the compatibility of each model with the cross-link set, we discovered that one specific model is significantly more compatible than any other model. Furthermore, bootstrapping analysis confirmed that this model is 10 times more likely to result from this cross-link set than the next best-fitting model. Our subunit arrangement is very different than any of the previously reported models and changes the context of existing and future findings on TRiC.",

        "abstract": "Contrary to popular assumption, the rate of growth of structural data has slowed, and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has not been growing exponentially since 1995. Reaching such a dramatic conclusion requires careful measurement of growth of novel structures, which can be achieved by clustering entry sequences, or by using a novel index to down-weight entries with a higher number of sequence neighbors. These measures agree, and growth rates are very similar for entire PDB files, clusters, and weighted chains. The overall sizes of Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) categories (number of families, superfamilies, and folds) appear to be directly proportional to the number of deposited PDB files. Using our weighted chain count, which is most correlated to the change in the size of each SCOP category in any time period, shows that the rate of increase of SCOP categories is actually slowing down. This enables the final size of each of these SCOP categories to be predicted without examining or comparing protein structures. In the last 3 years, structures solved by structural genomics (SG) initiatives, especially the United States National Institutes of Health Protein Structure Initiative, have begun to redress the slowing growth of the PDB. Structures solved by SG are 3.8 times less sequence-redundant than typical PDB structures. Since mid-2004, SG programs have contributed half the novel structures measured by weighted chain counts. Our analysis does not rely on visual inspection of coordinate sets: it is done automatically, providing an accurate, up-to-date measure of the growth of novel protein structural data.",

The spatial distribution functions of the water molecules surrounding benzene and cyclohexane computed previously from molecular dynamics simulations show a high density first hydration shell surrounding both solutes. In addition, benzene showed a strong preference for hydrogen bonding with two water molecules, one to each face of the benzene ring. The position data alone, however, do not describe the majority of orientational changes in the water molecules in the first hydration shells surrounding these solutes. In this paper, we measure the changes in orientation of the water molecules with respect to the solute through spatial orientation functions as well as radial/angular distribution functions. These data show that the water molecules hydrogen bonded to benzene have a strong orientation preference, whereas those around cyclohexane show a weaker tendency. In addition, the water-water interactions within and between the first two hydration shells were measured as a function of distance and \"best\" hydrogen bonding angle. Water molecules within the first hydration shell have increased hydrogen bonding structure; water molecules interacting across shell 1 and shell 2 have reduced hydrogen bonding structure.",

To produce a novel DAADH mutant with different substrate specificity, the crystal structure of apo-DAADH was determined at a resolution of 1.78 Å, and the amino acid residues responsible for the substrate specificity were evaluated using additional site-directed mutagenesis. By introducing a single D94A mutation, the enzyme's substrate specificity was dramatically altered; the mutant utilized d-phenylalanine as the most preferable substrate for oxidative deamination and had a specific activity of 5.33 μmol/min/mg at 50°C, which was 54-fold higher than that of the parent DAADH. In addition, the specific activities of the mutant toward d-leucine, d-norleucine, d-methionine, d-isoleucine, and d-tryptophan were much higher (6 to 25 times) than those of the parent enzyme. For reductive amination, the D94A mutant exhibited extremely high specific activity with phenylpyruvate (16.1 μmol/min/mg at 50°C). The structures of the D94A-Y224F double mutant in complex with NADP+ and in complex with both NADPH and 2-keto-6-aminocapronic acid (lysine oxo-analogue) were then determined at resolutions of 1.59 Å and 1.74 Å, respectively. The phenylpyruvate-binding model suggests that the D94A mutation prevents the substrate phenyl group from sterically clashing with the side chain of Asp94. A structural comparison suggests that both the enlarged substrate-binding pocket and enhanced hydrophobicity of the pocket are mainly responsible for the high reactivity of the D94A mutant toward the hydrophobic d-amino acids with bulky side chains.IMPORTANCE In recent years, the potential uses for d-amino acids as source materials for the industrial production of medicines, seasonings, and agrochemicals have been growing. To date, several methods have been used for the production of d-amino acids, but all include tedious steps. The use of NAD(P)+-dependent d-amino acid dehydrogenase (DAADH) makes single-step production of d-amino acids from oxo-acid analogs and ammonia possible. We recently succeeded in creating a stable DAADH and demonstrated that it is applicable for one-step synthesis of d-amino acids, such as d-leucine and d-isoleucine. As the next step, the creation of an enzyme exhibiting different substrate specificity and higher catalytic efficiency is a key to the further development of d-amino acid production. In this study, we succeeded in creating a novel mutant exhibiting extremely high catalytic activity for phenylpyruvate amination. Structural insight into the mutant will be useful for further improvement of DAADHs.",

        "abstract": "Central to the ab initio protein folding problem is the development of an energy function for which the correct native structure has a lower energy than all other conformations. Existing potentials of mean force typically rely extensively on database-derived contact frequencies or knowledge of three-dimensional structural information in order to be successful in the problem of recognizing the native fold for a given sequence from a set of decoy backbone conformations. Is the detailed statistical information or sophisticated analysis used by these knowledge-based potentials needed to achieve the observed degree of success in fold recognition? Here we introduce a novel pairwise energy function that enumerates contacts between hydrophobic residues while weighting their sum by the total number of residues surrounding these hydrophobic residues. Thus it effectively selects compact folds with the desired structural feature of a buried, intact core. This approach represents an advance over using pairwise terms whose energies of interaction that are independent of the position in the protein and greatly improves the discrimination capability of an energy function. Our results show that 85% of a set of 195 representative native folds were recognized correctly. The 29 exceptions were lipophilic proteins, small proteins with prosthetic groups or disulfide bonds, and oligomeric proteins. Overall, our method separates the native fold from incorrect folds by a larger margin (measured in standard deviation units) than has been previously demonstrated by more sophisticated methods. The arrangement of hydrophobic and polar residues alone as evaluated by our novel scoring scheme, is unexpectedly effective at recognizing native folds in general. It is surprising that a simple binary pattern of hydrophobic and polar residues apparently selects a give unique fold topology.",

This deformation of the native structure means that these methods are not generally used to refine structures produced by homology-modeling techniques. Here, we use a database of 75 proteins to test the ability of a variety of popular molecular mechanics force fields to maintain the native structure. Minimization from the native structure is a weak test of potential energy functions: It is complemented by a much stronger test in which the same methods are compared for their ability to attract a near-native decoy protein structure toward the native structure. We use a powerfully convergent energy-minimization method and show that, of the traditional molecular mechanics potentials tested, only one showed a modest net improvement over a large data set of structurally diverse proteins. A smooth, differentiable knowledge-based pairwise atomic potential performs better on this test than traditional potential functions. This work is expected to have important implications for protein structure refinement, homology modeling, and structure prediction.",

This information is used to derive sequences for protein domains in the SCOP database.

For eleven different helix predictions, the coefficients giving the correlation between prediction and observation range from 0.14 to 0.42. The accuracy of the predictions for both beta-sheet regions and for turns are generally lower than for the helices, and in a number of instances the agreement between prediction and observation is no better than would be expected for a random selection of residues. The structural predictions for T4 phage lysozyme are much less successful than was the case for adenylate kinase (Schulz et al. (1974) Nature 250, 140-142). No one method of prediction is clearly superior to all others, and although empirical predictions based on larger numbers of known protein structure tend to be more accurate than those based on a limited sample, the improvement in accuracy is not dramatic, suggesting that the accuracy of current empirical predictive methods will not be substantially increased simply by the inclusion of more data from additional protein structure determinations.",

We rely on the physical forces that stabilize native protein structures to choose the optimum sequence. Our energy function includes van der Waals interactions, electrostatics and an environment free energy. Successful protein design should be specific and generate a sequence compatible with the template fold and incompatible with competing folds. We impose specificity by maintaining the amino acid composition constant, based on the random energy model. The specificity of the optimized sequence is tested by fold recognition techniques. Successful sequence designs for the B1 domain of protein G, for the lambda repressor and for sperm whale myoglobin are presented. We show that each additional term of the energy function improves the performance of our design procedure: the van der Waals term ensures correct packing, the electrostatics term increases the specificity for the correct native fold, and the environment solvation term ensures a correct pattern of buried hydrophobic and exposed hydrophilic residues.

Based on the available data, a second round of AI-powered compound generation was conducted and through this, a more potent hit molecule, ISM042-2-048, was discovered with an average Kd value of 566.7 ± 256.2 nM (n = 3). Compound ISM042-2-048 also showed good CDK20 inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 33.4 ± 22.6 nM (n = 3). In addition, ISM042-2-048 demonstrated selective anti-proliferation activity in an HCC cell line with CDK20 overexpression, Huh7, with an IC50 of 208.7 ± 3.3 nM, compared to a counter screen cell line HEK293 (IC50 = 1706.7 ± 670.0 nM). This work is the first demonstration of applying AlphaFold to the hit identification process in drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "-dimensional structures (or conformations) of almost a hundred different protein molecules have been revealed in atomic detail thanks to the rapid advances that have been made in protein crystallography during the past two decades. In spite of this wealth of structural detail (60, 61), understanding how protein molecules change their conforma­ tions, vibrate in response to thermal perturbations, or fold has been hampered by the lack of theoretical and computational tools that can be used to extrapolate these functional properties of proteins from their atomic structures. The theoretical difficulties arise from the large size and intrinsic complexity of protein molecules, uncertainties about the nature and magnitude of the forces acting between atoms, lack of experience with computational methods that can simulate changes in conformation, and the absence of sufficiently accurate experimental data against which the calculations can be tested. Nevertheless, the past 15 years have witnessed considerable progress in the applications of conformational energy calculations to protein molecules. Protein molecules consist of between 500 and 10,000 hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and sulphur atoms bonded together to form a long polypeptide chain. In the native conformational state, this chain is folded into a globular structure in which (a) nonbonded atoms close-pack; (b) bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles have the same standard values as in small molecule structures; (c) almost all hydrogen bond acceptors and donors pair to form hydrogen bonds.

First, all possible compact conformations of a protein sequence are enumerated using a highly simplified tetrahedral lattice model. We select a large subset of these conformations using a lattice-based scoring function and build detailed all-atom models incorporating predicted secondary structure. A combined all-atom knowledge-based scoring function is then used to select three smaller subsets from these all-atom models. Finally, a consensus-based distance geometry procedure is used to generate the best conformations from each of the all-atom subsets. With this method, we are able to predict the global topology/shape for all or a large part of the sequence for six out of the thirteen proteins. For two other proteins, the topology/shape for shorter fragments are predicted. This represents a marked improvement in ab initio prediction since CASP was first instigated in 1994.",

        "abstract": "Movement is crucial to the biological function of many proteins, yet crystallographic structures of proteins can give us only a static snapshot. The protein dynamics that are important to biological function often happen on a timescale that is unattainable through detailed simulation methods such as molecular dynamics as they often involve crossing high-energy barriers. To address this coarse-grained motion, several methods have been implemented as web servers in which a set of coordinates is usually linearly interpolated from an initial crystallographic structure to a final crystallographic structure. We present a new morphing method that does not extrapolate linearly and can therefore go around high-energy barriers and which can produce different trajectories between the same two starting points. In this work, we evaluate our method and other established coarse-grained methods according to an objective measure: how close a coarse-grained dynamics method comes to a crystallographically determined intermediate structure when calculating a trajectory between the initial and final crystal protein structure. We test this with a set of five proteins with at least three crystallographically determined on-pathway high-resolution intermediate structures from the Protein Data Bank. For simple hinging motions involving a small conformational change, segmentation of the protein into two rigid sections outperforms other more computationally involved methods. However, large-scale conformational change is best addressed using a nonlinear approach and we suggest that there is merit in further developing such methods.",

Heme potential functions were used that reproduce the energies and forces for the iron out-of-plane motion obtained from quantum mechanical calculations. The effect of the protein on the rate and extent of the displacement of the iron from the porphyrin plane was assessed by comparing the results with those obtained for an isolated complex of heme with imidazole and carbon monoxide. The half-time for the displacement of the iron from the porphyrin plane was found to be 50-150 fs for both the protein and the isolated complex.

It has been shown that improvement could be achieved using in vacuo energy minimization with molecular mechanics and statistically derived continuously differentiable hybrid knowledge-based (KB) potential functions. Globular proteins, however, fold and function in aqueous solution in vivo and in vitro. In this work, we study the role of solvent in protein structure refinement. Molecular dynamics in explicit solvent and energy minimization in both explicit and implicit solvent were performed on a set of 75 native proteins to test the various energy potentials. A more stringent test for refinement was performed on 729 near-native decoys for each native protein. We use a powerfully convergent energy minimization method to show that implicit solvent (GBSA) provides greater improvement for some proteins than the KB potential: 24 of 75 proteins showing an average improvement of >20% in C(alpha) rmsd from the native structure with GBSA, compared to just 7 proteins with KB. Molecular dynamics in explicit solvent moved the structures further away from their native conformation than the initial, unrefined decoys.

To do this, we characterize a large fraction of the currently known protein sequences ( approximately 140,000) in structural terms, by matching them to known structures via sequence comparison (or by secondary-structure class prediction for those without structural homologues). Overall, we find that an appreciable fraction of the known folds are present in each of the major groups of organisms (e.g., bacteria and eukaryotes share 156 of 275 folds), and most of the common folds are associated with many families of nonhomologous sequences (i.e., >10 sequence families for each common fold). However, different groups of organisms have characteristically distinct distributions of folds. So, for instance, some of the most common folds in vertebrates, such as globins or zinc fingers, are rare or absent in bacteria. Many of these differences in fold usage are biologically reasonable, such as the folds of metabolic enzymes being common in bacteria and those associated with extracellular transport and communication being common in animals. They also have important implications for database-based methods for fold recognition, suggesting that an unknown sequence from a plant is more likely to have a certain fold (e.g., a TIM barrel) than an unknown sequence from an animal.",

        "abstract": "Protein loops often play important roles in biological functions. Modeling loops accurately is crucial to determining the functional specificity of a protein. Despite the recent progress in loop prediction approaches, which led to a number of algorithms over the past decade, few rigorous algorithmic approaches exist to model protein loops using global orientational restraints, such as those obtained from residual dipolar coupling (RDC) data in solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In this article, we present a novel, sparse data, RDC-based algorithm, which exploits the mathematical interplay between RDC-derived sphero-conics and protein kinematics, and formulates the loop structure determination problem as a system of low-degree polynomial equations that can be solved exactly, in closed-form. The polynomial roots, which encode the candidate conformations, are searched systematically, using provable pruning strategies that triage the vast majority of conformations, to enumerate or prune all possible loop conformations consistent with the data; therefore, completeness is ensured. Results on experimental RDC datasets for four proteins, including human ubiquitin, FF2, DinI, and GB3, demonstrate that our algorithm can compute loops with higher accuracy, a three- to six-fold improvement in backbone RMSD, versus those obtained by traditional structure determination protocols on the same data. Excellent results were also obtained on synthetic RDC datasets for protein loops of length 4, 8, and 12 used in previous studies. These results suggest that our algorithm can be successfully applied to determine protein loop conformations, and hence, will be useful in high-resolution protein backbone structure determination, including loops, from sparse NMR data.

The designed sequences provide a multiple sequence alignment that describes the sequence space compatible with the structure of interest; here the size of this space is estimated by using an information entropy measure. In parallel, multiple alignments of naturally occurring sequences can be derived by using either sequence or structure alignments. We compared these 3 independent multiple sequence alignments for 10 different proteins, ranging in size from 56 to 310 residues. We observed that the subset of the sequence space derived by using our design procedure is similar in size to the sequence spaces observed in nature. These results suggest that the volume of sequence space compatible with a given protein fold is defined by the length of the protein as well as by the topology (i.e., geometry of the polypeptide chain) and the stability (i.e., free energy of denaturation) of the fold.",

These trajectories were observed to differ widely from each other. Thus, rather than analyzing individual trajectories, we sought to identify the recurrent features of the high-temperature unfolding process. The conformations from all simulations were combined and then divided into groups based on the number of native contacts. Average occupancies of each side-chain hydrophobic contact and hydrogen bond in the protein were then determined. In the symmetric funnel limit, the occupancies of all contacts should decrease in concert with the loss in total number of native contacts. If there is a lack of symmetry or hierarchy to the unfolding process, the occupancies of some contacts should decrease more slowly, and others more rapidly. Despite the heterogeneity of the individual trajectories, the ensemble averaging revealed an order to the unfolding process: contacts between the N and C-terminal strands are the first to disappear, whereas contacts within the distal beta-hairpin and a hydrogen-bonding network involving the distal loop beta-turn and the diverging turn persist well after the majority of the native contacts are lost. This hierarchy of events resembles but is somewhat less pronounced than that observed in our experimental studies of the folding of src SH3 domain.",

In this work, we describe two differentiable knowledge-based potentials derived from a curated data set of RNA structures, with all-atom or coarse-grained representation, respectively. We focus on one aspect of the prediction problem: the identification of native-like RNA conformations from a set of near-native models. Using a variety of near-native RNA models generated from three independent methods, we show that our potential is able to distinguish the native structure and identify native-like conformations, even at the coarse-grained level. The all-atom version of our knowledge-based potential performs better and appears to be more effective at discriminating near-native RNA conformations than one of the most highly regarded parameterized potential.

Our method is based on random sampling of conformation space and subsequent local energy minimization. At the core of this approach lies the design of a novel type of energy function. This energy function has local minima with native structure characteristics and wide basins of attraction. The current work presents our motivation for deriving such an energy function and also tests the derived energy function. Our approach is novel in that it takes advantage of the inherently rough energy landscape of proteins, which is generally considered a major obstacle for protein structure prediction. When local minima have wide basins of attraction, the protein's conformation space can be greatly reduced by the convergence of large regions of the space into single points, namely the local minima corresponding to these funnels. We have implemented this concept by an iterative process. The potential is first used to generate decoy sets and then we study these sets of decoys to guide further development of the potential. A key feature of our potential is the use of cooperative multi-body interactions that mimic the role of the entropic and solvent contributions to the free energy. The validity and value of our approach is demonstrated by applying it to 14 diverse, small proteins. We show that, for these proteins, the size of conformation space is considerably reduced by the new energy function. In fact, the reduction is so substantial as to allow efficient conformational sampling. As a result we are able to find a significant number of near-native conformations in random searches performed with limited computational resources.",

        "abstract": "There are several knowledge-based energy functions that can distinguish the native fold from a pool of grossly misfolded decoys for a given sequence of amino acids. These decoys, which are typically generated by mounting, or \"threading\", the sequence onto the backbones of unrelated protein structures, tend to be non-compact and quite different from the native structure: the root-mean-squared (RMS) deviations from the native are commonly in the range of 15 to 20 angstroms. Effective energy functions should also demonstrate a similar recognition capability when presented with compact decoys that depart only slightly in conformation from the correct structure (i.e. those with RMS deviations of approximately 5 angstroms or less). Recently, we developed a simple yet powerful method for native fold recognition based on the tendency for native folds to form hydrophobic cores. Our energy measure, which we call the hydrophobic fitness score, is challenged to recognize the native fold from 2000 near-native structures generated for each of five small monomeric proteins. First, 1000 conformations for each protein were generated by molecular dynamics simulation at room temperature. The average RMS deviation of this set of 5000 was 1.5 angstroms. A total of 323 decoys had energies lower than native; however, none of these had RMS deviations greater than 2 angstroms. Another 1000 structures were generated for each at high temperature, in which a greater range of conformational space was explored (4.3 angstroms RMS deviation). Out of this set, only seven decoys were misrecognized. The hydrophobic fitness energy of a conformation is strongly dependent upon the RMS deviation. On average our potential yields energy values which are lowest for the population of structures generated at room temperature, intermediate for those produced at high temperature and highest for those constructed by threading methods. In general, the lowest energy decoy conformations have backbones very close to native structure. The possible utility of our method for screening backbone candidates for the purpose of modelling by side-chain packing optimization is discussed.",

An indirect consequence of this is that protein design should define the sequence space accessible to a given structure, rather than providing a single optimized sequence. We have recently developed a new approach for protein sequence design, which optimizes the complete sequence of a protein based on the knowledge of its backbone structure, its amino acid composition and a physical energy function including van der Waals interactions, electrostatics, and environment free energy. The specificity of the designed sequence for its template backbone is imposed by keeping the amino acid composition fixed. Here, we show that our procedure converges in sequence space, albeit not to the native sequence of the protein. We observe that while polar residues are well conserved in our designed sequences, non-polar amino acids at the surface of a protein are often replaced by polar residues. The designed sequences provide a multiple alignment of sequences that all adopt the same three-dimensional fold. This alignment is used to derive a profile matrix for chicken triose phosphate isomerase, TIM. The matrix is found to recognize significantly the native sequence for TIM, as well as closely related sequences. Possible application of this approach to protein fold recognition is discussed.",

With the use of a simplified model, we exhaustively enumerate the space of all sequences and the space of all structures, simulate the evolutionary relationship between sequences and structures, and characterize the steady-state sequence distribution for all structures in terms of several thermodynamic variables. We assess the effects of two major forces of evolution: mutation and recombination. Three simplifications are made. First, a two-dimensional lattice model is used to represent protein sequences and structures. Second, proteins undergo neutral evolution so that the fitness landscape has a flat allowed region inside of which all sequences are equally fit. Third, we ignore otherwise important factors such as finite population size and evolutionary time. Two scenarios emerge from our study. The first occurs when evolution is dominated by mutation events. Even though the prototype sequence that is most mutationally robust is preferred by evolution, the preference is not strong enough to offset the huge size of sequence space. Most native sequences are located near the boundary of the fitness region and are marginally compatible with the native structure. The second scenario occurs when evolution is dominated by recombination events. Now evolutionary preference for prototype sequence is strong enough to overcome the size of sequence space so that most native sequences are located near the center of sequence-structure compatibility. We conclude that the relative frequency of mutation and recombination events is a major determinant of how optimal protein sequences are for their structures.",

        "title": "Competitive assessment of protein fold recognition and alignment accuracy",
        "abstract": "The predictions made for fold recognition and modeling accuracy at the 1996 Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction meeting (CASP2) were assessed to discover which groups did best. With 32 groups making a total of 369 predictions, it was necessary to use simple criteria for distinguishing between the entries. By focusing on the predictors' ability to use the sequence of the unknown target structure to recognize the target fold from a database of known folds and also on the quality of the model judged by the accuracy of the predicted alignment, it is easy to determine the best predictions for a given target. Assessing overall performance of the predictors on all the targets is much more difficult and use was made of weighted averages of fold recognition and alignment accuracy with and without normalization for target difficulty. By plotting these results in two dimensions the winning groups stand out, allowing readers to focus their attention on the most promising methods. When the present results are compared with the results of the earlier CASP1 meeting, held in 1994, it is clear that threading predictions have progressed dramatically. For this assessor, the strongest lesson learned is that subjectivity is pervasive and affects us all. It is abundantly clear that the blind predictions made at CASP are essential if progress is to be made in predicting protein structure.",

        "abstract": "The eukaryotic group II chaperonin TRiC/CCT is a 16-subunit complex with eight distinct but similar subunits arranged in two stacked rings. Substrate folding inside the central chamber is triggered by ATP hydrolysis. We present five cryo-EM structures of TRiC in apo and nucleotide-induced states without imposing symmetry during the 3D reconstruction. These structures reveal the intra- and inter-ring subunit interaction pattern changes during the ATPase cycle. In the apo state, the subunit arrangement in each ring is highly asymmetric, whereas all nucleotide-containing states tend to be more symmetrical. We identify and structurally characterize an one-ring closed intermediate induced by ATP hydrolysis wherein the closed TRiC ring exhibits an observable chamber expansion. This likely represents the physiological substrate folding state. Our structural results suggest mechanisms for inter-ring-negative cooperativity, intra-ring-positive cooperativity, and protein-folding chamber closure of TRiC. Intriguingly, these mechanisms are different from other group I and II chaperonins despite their similar architecture.",

        "abstract": "e triphosphates (NTPs) diffuse to the active center of RNA polymerase II through a funnel-shaped opening that narrows to a negatively charged pore. Computer simulation shows that the funnel and pore reduce the rate of diffusion by a factor of approximately 2 x 10(-7). The resulting limitation on the rate of RNA synthesis under conditions of low NTP concentration may be overcome by NTP binding to an entry site adjacent to the active center. Binding to the entry site greatly enhances the lifetime of an NTP in the active center region, and it prevents \"backtracking\" and the consequent occlusion of the active site.",

        "title": "RNA polymerase II trigger loop residues stabilize and position the incoming nucleotide triphosphate in transcription",
        "abstract": "A structurally conserved element, the trigger loop, has been suggested to play a key role in substrate selection and catalysis of RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription elongation. Recently resolved X-ray structures showed that the trigger loop forms direct interactions with the beta-phosphate and base of the matched nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) through residues His1085 and Leu1081, respectively. In order to understand the role of these two critical residues in stabilizing active site conformation in the dynamic complex, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the wild-type pol II elongation complex and its mutants in explicit solvent. In the wild-type complex, we found that the trigger loop is stabilized in the \"closed\" conformation, and His1085 forms a stable interaction with the NTP. Simulations of point mutations of His1085 are shown to affect this interaction; simulations of alternative protonation states, which are inaccessible through experiment, indicate that only the protonated form is able to stabilize the His1085-NTP interaction. Another trigger loop residue, Leu1081, stabilizes the incoming nucleotide position through interaction with the nucleotide base. Our simulations of this Leu mutant suggest a three-component mechanism for correctly positioning the incoming NTP in which (i) hydrophobic contact through Leu1081, (ii) base stacking, and (iii) base pairing work together to minimize the motion of the incoming NTP base. These results complement experimental observations and provide insight into the role of the trigger loop on transcription fidelity.",

        "abstract": "It is commonly believed that similarities between the sequences of two proteins infer similarities between their structures. Sequence alignments reliably recognize pairs of protein of similar structures provided that the percentage sequence identity between their two sequences is sufficiently high. This distinction, however, is statistically less reliable when the percentage sequence identity is lower than 30% and little is known then about the detailed relationship between the two measures of similarity. Here, we investigate the inverse correlation between structural similarity and sequence similarity on 12 protein structure families. We define the structure similarity between two proteins as the cRMS distance between their structures. The sequence similarity for a pair of proteins is measured as the mean distance between the sequences in the subsets of sequence space compatible with their structures. We obtain an approximation of the sequence space compatible with a protein by designing a collection of protein sequences both stable and specific to the structure of that protein. Using these measures of sequence and structure similarities, we find that structural changes within a protein family are linearly related to changes in sequence similarity.",

        "abstract": "We review the key steps leading to an improved analysis of thermal protein unfolding. Thermal unfolding is a dynamic cooperative process with many short-lived intermediates. Protein unfolding has been measured by various spectroscopic techniques that reveal structural changes, and by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) that provides the heat capacity change Cp(T). The corresponding temperature profiles of enthalpy ΔH(T), entropy ΔS(T), and free energy ΔG(T) have thus far been evaluated using a chemical equilibrium two-state model. Taking a different approach, we demonstrated that the temperature profiles of enthalpy ΔH(T), entropy ΔS(T), and free energy ΔG(T) can be obtained directly by a numerical integration of the heat capacity profile Cp(T). DSC thus offers the unique possibility to assess these parameters without resorting to a model. These experimental parameters now allow us to examine the predictions of different unfolding models. The standard two-state model fits the experimental heat capacity peak quite well. However, neither the enthalpy nor entropy profiles (predicted to be almost linear) are congruent with the measured sigmoidal temperature profiles, nor is the parabolic free energy profile congruent with the experimentally observed trapezoidal temperature profile. We introduce three new models, an empirical two-state model, a statistical-mechanical two-state model and a cooperative statistical-mechanical multistate model. The empirical model partially corrects for the deficits of the standard model. However, only the two statistical-mechanical models are thermodynamically consistent. The two-state models yield good fits for the enthalpy, entropy and free energy of unfolding of small proteins. The cooperative statistical-mechanical multistate model yields perfect fits, even for the unfolding of large proteins such as antibodies.",

        "abstract": "We ran and analyzed a total of eighteen, 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations of two C-terminal beta-hairpins from the B1 domain of Protein G: twelve runs for the last 16 residues and six runs for the last 15 residues, G41-E56 and E42-E56, respectively. Based on their CalphaRMS deviation from the starting structure and the pattern of stabilizing interactions (hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts, and salt bridges), we were able to classify the twelve runs on G41-E56 into one of three general states of the beta-hairpin ensemble: 'Stable', 'Unstable', and 'Unfolded'. Comparing the specific interactions between these states, we find that on average the stable beta-hairpin buries 287 A(2) of hydrophobic surface area, makes 13 hydrogen bonds, and forms 3 salt-bridges. We find that the hydrophobic core prefers to make some specific contacts; however, this core does not require optimal packing. Side-chain hydrogen bonds stabilize the beta-hairpin turn with strong stabilizing interactions primarily due to the carboxyl of D46 with contributions from T49 hydroxyl. Buoyed by the strength of the hydrophobic core, other hydrogen bonds, primarily main-chain, guide the beta-hairpin into registration by forming a loose network of interactions, making an approximately constant number of hydrogen bonds from a pool of possible candidates. In simulations on E42-E56, where the salt bridge closing the termini is not favored, we observe that all the simulations show no 'Stable' behavior, but are 'Unstable' or 'Unfolded'. We can estimate that the salt-bridge between the termini provides approximately 1.3 kcal/mol. Altogether, the results suggest that the beta-hairpin folds beginning at the turn, followed by hydrophobic collapse, and then hydrogen bond formation. Salt bridges help to stabilize the folded conformations by inhibiting unfolded states.",

        "abstract": "Pressure-induced perturbation of a protein structure leading to its folding-unfolding mechanism is an important yet not fully understood phenomenon. The key point here is the role of water and its coupling with protein conformations as a function of pressure. In the current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation at 298 K, we systematically examine the coupling between protein conformations and water structures of pressures of 0.001, 5, 10, 15, 20 kbar, starting from (partially) unfolded structures of the protein Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI). We also calculate localized thermodynamics at those pressures as a function of protein-water distance. Our findings show that both protein-specific and generic effects of pressure are operating. In particular, we found that (1) the amount of increase in water density near the protein depends on the protein structural heterogeneity; (2) the intra-protein hydrogen bond decreases with pressure, while the water-water hydrogen bond per water in the first solvation shell (FSS) increases; protein-water hydrogen bonds also found to increase with pressure, (3) with pressure hydrogen bonds of waters in the FSS getting twisted; and (4) water's tetrahedrality in the FSS decreases with pressure, but it is dependent on the local environment. Thermodynamically, at higher pressure, the structural perturbation of BPTI is due to the pressure-volume work, while the entropy decreases with the increase of pressure due to the higher translational and rotational rigidity of waters in the FSS. The local and subtle effects of pressure, found in this work, are likely to be typical of pressure-induced protein structure perturbation.",

To address this challenge, a social-media based worldwide collaborative effort, named WeFold, was undertaken by 13 labs. During the collaboration, the laboratories were simultaneously competing with each other. Here, we present the first attempt at \"coopetition\" in scientific research applied to the protein structure prediction and refinement problems. The coopetition was possible by allowing the participating labs to contribute different components of their protein structure prediction pipelines and create new hybrid pipelines that they tested during CASP10.

Since 1982, we find a steady drop in the number of grant-eligible basic-science faculty [principal investigators (PIs)] younger than 46. This fall occurred over a 32-y period when inflation-corrected congressional funds for NIH almost tripled. During this time, the PI success ratio (fraction of basic-science PIs who are R01 grantees) dropped for younger PIs (below 46) and increased for older PIs (above 55). This age-related bias seems to have caused the steady drop in the number of young basic-science PIs and could reduce future US discoveries in fundamental biomedical science. The NIH recognized this bias in its 2008 early-stage investigator (ESI) policy to fund young PIs at higher rates. We show this policy is working and recommend that it be enhanced by using better data. Together with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA) program to reward senior PIs with research time in exchange for less funding, this may reverse a decades-long trend of more money going to older PIs. To prepare young scientists for increased demand, additional resources should be devoted to transitional postdoctoral fellowships already offered by NIH.",

        "abstract": "Intramolecular interactions in bound cholera toxin peptide (CTP3) in three antibody complexes were studied by two-dimensional transferred NOE spectroscopy. These measurements together with previously recorded spectra that show intermolecular interactions in these complexes were used to obtain restraints on interproton distances in two of these complexes (TE32 and TE33). The NMR-derived distance restraints were used to dock the peptide into calculated models for the three-dimensional structure of the antibody combining site. It was found that TE32 and TE33 recognize a loop comprising the sequence VPGSQHID and a beta-turn formed by the sequence VPGS. The third antibody, TE34, recognizes a different epitope within the same peptide and a beta-turn formed by the sequence IDSQ. Neither of these two turns was observed in the free peptide. The formation of a beta-turn in the bound peptide gives a compact conformation that maximizes the contact with the antibody and that has greater conformational freedom than alpha-helix or beta-sheet secondary structure. A total of 15 antibody residues are involved in peptide contacts in the TE33 complex, and 73% of the contact area in the antibody combining site consists of the side chains of aromatic amino acids. A comparison of the NMR-derived models for CTP3 interacting with TE32 and TE33 with the previously derived model for TE34 reveals a relationship between amino acid sequence and combining site structure and function. (a) The three aromatic residues that interact with the peptide in TE32 and TE33 complexes, Tyr 32L, Tyr 32H, and Trp 50H, are invariant in all light chains sharing at least 65% identity with TE33 and TE32 and in all heavy chains sharing at least 75% identity with TE33. Although TE34 differs from TE32 and TE33 in its fine specificity, these aromatic residues are conserved in TE34 and interact with its antigen. Therefore, we conclude that the role of these three aromatic residues is to participate in nonspecific hydrophobic interactions with the antigen. (b) Residues 31, 31c, and 31e of CDR1 of the light chain interact with the antigen in all three antibodies that we have studied. The amino acids in these positions in TE34 differ from those in TE32 and TE33, and they are involved in specific polar interactions with the antigen. (c) CDR3 of the heavy chain varies considerably both in length and in sequence between TE34 and the two other anti-CTP3 antibodies. These changes modify the shape of the combining site and the hydrophobic and polar interactions of CDR3 with the peptide antigen.",

Here, we exhaustively assess the R value fit of all possible CCT models to available crystallographic data of the closed and open forms with resolutions of 3.8 Å and 5.5 Å, respectively. This unbiased analysis finds the native subunit arrangements with overwhelming significance. The resulting structures provide independent crystallographic proof of the subunit arrangement of CCT and map major asymmetrical features of the particle onto specific subunits. The actin and tubulin substrates both bind around subunit CCT6, which shows other structural anomalies. CCT is thus clearly partitioned, both functionally and evolutionary, into a substrate-binding side that is opposite to the ATP-hydrolyzing side.",

Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have been transmitted to humans from wild animals. Given the scale and widespread geographical distribution of the current pandemic and confirmed cases of cross-species transmission, the question of the extent to which this transmission is possible emerges, as well as what molecular features distinguish susceptible from non-susceptible animal species. Here, we investigated the structural properties of several ACE2 orthologs bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that species known not to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection have non-conservative mutations in several ACE2 amino acid residues that disrupt key polar and charged contacts with the viral spike protein. Our models also allow us to predict affinity-enhancing mutations that could be used to design ACE2 variants for therapeutic purposes. Finally, our study provides a blueprint for modeling viral-host protein interactions and highlights several important considerations when designing these computational studies and analyzing their results.",

We compared 6 calculations of excess deaths (4 previously published [3 without age-adjustment] and two new ones that we performed with and without age-adjustment) for 2020-2021. With each approach, we calculated excess deaths metrics and the ratio R of excess deaths over recorded COVID-19 deaths. The main analysis focused on 33 high-income countries with weekly deaths in the Human Mortality Database (HMD at mortality.org) and reliable death registration. Secondary analyses compared calculations for other countries, whenever available. Across the 33 high-income countries, excess deaths were 2.0-2.8 million without age-adjustment, and 1.6-2.1 million with age-adjustment with large differences across countries. In our analyses after age-adjustment, 8 of 33 countries had no overall excess deaths; there was a death deficit in children; and 0.478 million (29.7%) of the excess deaths were in people <65 years old. In countries like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain excess death estimates differed 2 to 4-fold between highest and lowest figures. The R values' range exceeded 0.3 in all 33 countries. In 16 of 33 countries, the range of R exceeded 1. In 25 of 33 countries some calculations suggest R > 1 (excess deaths exceeding COVID-19 deaths) while others suggest R < 1 (excess deaths smaller than COVID-19 deaths). Inferred data from 4 evaluations for 42 countries and from 3 evaluations for another 98 countries are very tenuous.

Understanding the role of the ion-hydration shell in the physical mechanisms of the biological functioning of DNA requires detailed studies of its structure and dynamics at the atomistic level. In the present work, the study of collective vibrations of water molecules around the DNA double helix was performed within the framework of classical all-atom molecular dynamics methods. Calculating the vibrational density of states, the vibrations of water molecules in the low-frequency spectra ranged from [Formula: see text]30 to [Formula: see text]300 [Formula: see text] were analyzed for the case of different regions of the DNA double helix (minor groove, major groove, and phosphate groups). The analysis revealed significant differences in the collective vibrations behavior of water molecules in the DNA hydration shell, compared to the vibrations of bulk water. All low-frequency modes of the DNA ion-hydration shell are shifted by about 15-20 [Formula: see text] towards higher frequencies, which is more significant for water molecules in the minor groove region of the double helix. The interactions of water molecules with the atoms of the macromolecule induce intensity decrease of the mode of hydrogen-bond symmetrical stretching near 150 [Formula: see text], leading to the disappearance of this mode in the DNA spectra. The obtained results can provide an interpretation of the experimental data for DNA low-frequency spectra and may be important for the understanding of the processes of indirect protein-nucleic recognition.",

        "abstract": "The hydrophobic hydration of fullerenes in water is of significant interest as the most common Buckminsterfullerene (C60) is a mesoscale sphere; C60 also has potential in pharmaceutical and nanomaterial applications. We use an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation lasting hundreds of nanoseconds to determine the behavior of a single molecule of C60 in a periodic box of water, and compare this to methane. A C60 molecule does not induce drying at the surface; however, unlike a hard sphere methane, a hard sphere C60 solute does. This is due to a larger number of attractive Lennard-Jones interactions between the carbon atom centers in C60 and the surrounding waters. In these simulations, water is not uniformly arranged but rather adopts a range of orientations in the first hydration shell despite the spherical symmetry of both solutes. There is a clear effect of solute size on the orientation of the first hydration shell waters. There is a large increase in hydrogen-bonding contacts between waters in the C60 first hydration shell. There is also a disruption of hydrogen bonds between waters in the first and second hydration shells. Water molecules in the first hydration shell preferentially create triangular structures that minimize the net water dipole near the surface near both the methane and C60 surface, reducing the total energy of the system. Additionally, in the first and second hydration shells, the water dipoles are ordered to a distance of 8 A from the solute surface. We conclude that, with a diameter of approximately 1 nm, C60 behaves as a large hydrophobic solute.",

        "abstract": "The ab initio folding problem can be divided into two sequential tasks of approximately equal computational complexity: the generation of native-like backbone folds and the positioning of side chains upon these backbones. The prediction of side-chain conformation in this context is challenging, because at best only the near-native global fold of the protein is known. To test the effect of displacements in the protein backbones on side-chain prediction for folds generated ab initio, sets of near-native backbones (< or = 4 A C alpha RMS error) for four small proteins were generated by two methods. The steric environment surrounding each residue was probed by placing the side chains in the native conformation on each of these decoys, followed by torsion-space optimization to remove steric clashes on a rigid backbone. We observe that on average 40% of the chi1 angles were displaced by 40 degrees or more, effectively setting the limits in accuracy for side-chain modeling under these conditions. Three different algorithms were subsequently used for prediction of side-chain conformation. The average prediction accuracy for the three methods was remarkably similar: 49% to 51% of the chi1 angles were predicted correctly overall (33% to 36% of the chi1+2 angles). Interestingly, when the inter-side-chain interactions were disregarded, the mean accuracy increased. A consensus approach is described, in which side-chain conformations are defined based on the most frequently predicted chi angles for a given method upon each set of near-native backbones. We find that consensus modeling, which de facto includes backbone flexibility, improves side-chain prediction: chi1 accuracy improved to 51-54% (36-42% of chi1+2). Implications of a consensus method for ab initio protein structure prediction are discussed.",

Here, we analyze Hamilton equations of motion in the limit of weak external field when potential satisfies the condition 2V(q)≪mc2. We formulate very strong necessary integrability conditions for the case when the potential is a homogeneous function of coordinates of integer non-zero degrees. If Hamilton equations are integrable in the Liouville sense, then eigenvalues of the scaled Hessian matrix γ-1V″(d) at any non-zero solution d of the algebraic system V'(d)=γd must be integer numbers of appropriate form depending on k. As it turns out, these conditions are much stronger than those for the corresponding non-relativistic Hamilton equations. According to our best knowledge, the obtained results are the first general integrability necessary conditions for relativistic systems. Moreover, a relation between the integrability of these systems and corresponding non-relativistic systems is discussed. The obtained integrability conditions are very easy to use because the calculations reduce to linear algebra. We show their strength in the example of Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom with polynomial homogeneous potentials. It seems that the only integrable relativistic systems with such potentials are those depending only on one coordinate or having a radial form.",

Structural comparison of Mm-cpn in ATP-free, ATP-bound, and ATP-hydrolysis states reveals that ATP binding alone causes the chaperonin to close slightly with a ∼45° counterclockwise rotation of the apical domain. The subsequent ATP hydrolysis drives each subunit to rock toward the folding chamber and to close the lid completely.

        "abstract": "Protein structure refinement is an important but unsolved problem; it must be solved if we are to predict biological function that is very sensitive to structural details. Specifically, critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction (CASP) shows that the accuracy of predictions in the comparative modeling category is often worse than that of the template on which the homology model is based. Here we describe a refinement protocol that is able to consistently refine submitted predictions for all categories at CASP7. The protocol uses direct energy minimization of the knowledge-based potential of mean force that is based on the interaction statistics of 167 atom types (Summa and Levitt, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2007; 104:3177-3182). Our protocol is thus computationally very efficient; it only takes a few minutes of CPU time to run typical protein models (300 residues). We observe an average structural improvement of 1% in GDT_TS, for predictions that have low and medium homology to known PDB structures (Global Distance Test score or GDT_TS between 50 and 80%). We also observe a marked improvement in the stereochemistry of the models. The level of improvement varies amongst the various participants at CASP, but we see large improvements (>10% increase in GDT_TS) even for models predicted by the best performing groups at CASP7. In addition, our protocol consistently improved the best predicted models in the refinement category at CASP7 and CASP8. These improvements in structure and stereochemistry prove the usefulness of our computationally inexpensive, powerful and automatic refinement protocol.",

        "abstract": "ethods for predicting protein structure depend on two interrelated components: (i) an energy function that should have a low value near the correct structure and (ii) a method for searching through different conformations of the polypeptide chain. Identification of the most efficient search methods is essential if we are to be able to apply such methods broadly and with confidence. In addition, efficient search methods provide a rigorous test of existing energy functions, which are generally knowledge-based and contain different terms added together with arbitrary weights. Here, we test different search methods with one of the most accurate and predictive energy functions, namely Rosetta the knowledge-based force-field from Baker's group [Simons K, Kooperberg C, Huang E, Baker D (1997) J Mol Biol 268:209–225]. We use an implementation of a generalized ensemble search method to scale relevant parts of the energy function. This method, known as Hamiltonian Replica Exchange Monte Carlo, outperforms the original Monte Carlo Simulated Annealing used in the Rosetta package in terms of sampling low-energy states. It also outperforms another widely used generalized ensemble search method known as Temperature Replica Exchange Monte Carlo. Our results reveal clear deficiencies in the low-resolution Rosetta energy function in that the lowest energy structures are not necessarily the most native-like. By using a set of nonnative low-energy structures found by our extensive sampling, we discovered that the long-range and short-range backbone hydrogen-bonding energy terms of the Rosetta energy discriminate between the nonnative and native-like structures significantly better than the low-resolution score used in Rosetta.",

Using a novel methodology for determining contacts, we can precisely follow hydrophobic aggregation as it proceeds through three stages: dispersed, transition, and collapsed. Theoretical modeling of the cluster formation observed by simulation indicates that this aggregation is cooperative and that the simulations favor the formation of a single cluster midway through the transition stage. This defines a minimum solute hydrophobic core volume. We compare this with protein hydrophobic core volumes determined from solved crystal structures. Our analysis shows that the solute core volume roughly estimates the minimum core size required for independent hydrophobic stabilization of a protein and defines a limiting concentration of nonpolar residues that can cause hydrophobic collapse. These results suggest that the physical forces driving aggregation of hydrophobic molecules in water is indeed responsible for protein folding.",

Aromatic amino acids are found to play an important role in peptide binding. In both antibodies two tryptophan and two tyrosine residues and one histidine residue interact with the peptide. In TE33 there is an additional phenylalanine residue that also interacts with the peptide. The residues of the CTP3 peptide that have been found to interact with the antibody are val 3, pro 4, gly 5, gln 7, his 8, and asp 10. We have determined the amino acid sequences of the two antibodies by direct mRNA sequencing. Computerized molecular modeling has been used to build detailed all-atom models of both antibodies from the known conformations of other antibodies. These models allow unambiguous assignment of most of the antibody residues that interact with the peptide. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of the two anti-CTP3 antibodies with other antibodies from the same gene family reveals that the majority of the aromatic residues involved in the binding of CTP3 are conserved although these antibodies have different specificities. This similarity suggests that these aromatic residues create a general hydrophobic pocket and that other residues in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) modulate the shape and the polarity of the combining site to fit the specific antigens.",

The region of similarity consists of a 3-stranded beta-sheet and an alpha-helix. This region is highly similar; the corresponding elements of secondary structure share a common topology, and the RMS difference for \"equivalent\" C alpha atoms is 1.6 A. Surprisingly, this common structure arises from completely different sequences. For the common core, the sequence identity is less than 3%, and there is neither significant sequence similarity nor similarity in the position or orientation of conserved hydrophobic residues. This superposition raises the question of how 2 entirely different sequences can produce an identical structure. Analyzing this common region in ovomucoid revealed that it is stabilized by disulfide bonds. In contrast, the corresponding structure in CTF is stabilized in the alpha-helix by a composition of residues with high helix-forming propensities. This result suggests that different sequences and different stabilizing interactions can produce an identical structure.",

In contrast, DEN refinement improved even the most distant starting model as judged by R(free), atomic root-mean-square differences to the true structure, significance of features not included in the initial model, and connectivity of electron density. The best protocol was DEN refinement with initial segmented rigid-body refinement. For the most distant initial model, the fraction of atoms within 2 Å of the true structure improved from 24% to 60%.

We demonstrate that these libraries are able to both capture structural features present in RNA and fit local RNA structure with a high level of accuracy.

However, due to a shortened heavy chain CDR3, TE34 assumes a radically different combining site structure. The assignment of the combining site interactions to specific peptide residues was completed by use of AcIDSQRKA, a truncated peptide analogue in which lysine-13 was substituted by arginine, specific deuteration of individual polypeptide chains of the antibody, and a computer model for the Fv fragment of TE34. NMR-derived distance restraints were then applied to the calculated model of the Fv to generate a three-dimensional structure of the TE34/CTP3 complex. The combining site was found to be a very hydrophobic cavity composed of seven aromatic residues. Charged residues are found in the periphery of the combining site. The peptide residues HIDSQKKA form a beta-turn inside the combining site.

Defining the structural basis by which these proteins are anchored to membranes has been hampered by the paucity of unambiguously identified MIPs and a lack of computational tools that accurately distinguish monolayer-integrating motifs from bilayer-spanning transmembrane domains (TMDs). We used quantitative proteomics and statistical modeling to identify 87 high-confidence candidate MIPs in lipid droplets, including 21 proteins with predicted TMDs that cannot be accommodated in these monolayer-enveloped organelles. Systematic cysteine-scanning mutagenesis showed the predicted TMD of one candidate MIP, DHRS3, to be a partially buried amphipathic α-helix in both lipid droplet monolayers and the cytoplasmic leaflet of endoplasmic reticulum membrane bilayers. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations support these observations, suggesting that this helix is most stable at the solvent-membrane interface. The simulations also predicted similar interfacial amphipathic helices when applied to seven additional MIPs from our dataset. Our findings suggest that interfacial helices may be a common motif by which MIPs are integrated into membranes, and provide high-throughput methods to identify and study MIPs.",

It is suggested that the primary role of DNA in the chain of causality is that its presence allows a living system to induce perturbations of its own dynamics as a function of its own system state or phenome, i.e. it capacitates living systems to self-transcend beyond those morphogenetic limits that exist for non-living open physical systems in general. Dynamic models bridging genotypes with phenotypic variation in a causally cohesive way are shown to provide explanations of genetic phenomena that go well beyond the explanatory domains of statistically oriented genetics theory construction. A theory originally proposed by Rupert Riedl, which implies that the morphospace that is reachable by the standing genetic variation in a population is quite restricted due to systemic constraints, is shown to provide a foundation for a mathematical conceptualization of numerous evolutionary phenomena associated with the phenotypic consequence to sequence relation.

In the recombinant H(II)L(I) all the tyrosines and phenylalanines were perdeuterated as were the tryptophan residues of the light chain. Saturation of three resonances of H(I)L(II), assigned to tryptophan protons of the light chain, resulted in magnetization transfer to the aromatic proton at position 6 of the DNP ring and to the CH2 protons of the glycines linked to the DNP in a diamagnetic hapten (DNP-DG). Saturation of three resonances of H(II)L(I) assigned to tryptophan protons of the heavy chain resulted in magnetization transfer to the CH2 protons of the glycines in DNP-DG. From the dependence of the magnetization transfer on the irradiation time, the cross relaxation rates between the involved protons were estimated. The inferred distances between these protons of the hapten and certain tryptophan protons are 3-4 A. It is concluded that in the combining site of AN02 there is one tryptophan from the light chain and one tryptophan from the heavy chain that are very near the hapten. When all tyrosines and phenylalanines were perdeuterated and all tryptophan aromatic protons were deuterated except for the protons at positions 2 and 5, titration of the Fab fragments with variable amounts of paramagnetic hapten showed that one proton from the light chain tryptophan is near (less than 7 A) the unpaired electron and that three other protons are significantly closer than 15 A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The degrees of freedom are taken as the loop torsion angles. This choice preserves the native secondary structure but allows the tertiary structure to change. The proteins are represented by three-point per residue, three-dimensional models with statistical potentials derived from a knowledge-based study of known protein structures. When this space is sampled by a combination of parallel tempering and equi-energy Monte Carlo, we find that the three-point model captures the known stability of protein native structures with stable energy basins that are near-native (all alpha: 4.77 A, all beta: 2.93 A, alpha/beta: 3.09 A, alpha+beta: 4.89 A on average and within 6 A for 71.41%, 92.85%, 94.29% and 64.28% for all-alpha, all-beta, alpha/beta and alpha+beta, classes, respectively).

We find an increase in secondary structure motifs at longer Q-lengths, including β-sheet content that seems to contribute to the formation of increasingly compact structures.

An all-atom conditional probability discriminatory function is useful at selecting conformations with overall low all-atom root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) and the discrimination improves on sets that are closer to the native conformation. In addition, the naive approach performs as well as more sophisticated methods in terms of the percentage of chi(1) angles built accurately and the all-atom r. m.s.d., between the native and near-native conformations.

        "abstract": "Analysis of CASP2 protein threading results shows that the success rate of structure predictions varies widely among prediction targets. We set \"critical\" thresholds in fold recognition specificity and threading model accuracy at the points where \"incorrect\" CASP2 predictions just outnumber \"correct\" predictions. Using these thresholds we find that correct predictions were made for all of those targets and for only those targets where more than 50% of target residues may be superimposed on previously known structures. Three-fourths of these correct predictions were furthermore made for targets with greater than 12% residue identity in structural alignment, where characteristic sequence motifs are also present. Based on these observations we suggest that the sustained performance of threading methods is best characterized by counting the numbers of correct predictions for targets of increasing \"difficulty.\" We suggest that target difficulty may be assigned, once the true structure of the target is known, according to the fraction of residues superimposable onto previously known structures and the fraction of identical residues in those structural alignments.",

In addition, we assign coordinates to all atoms for four of the 25 proteins and show that this has a small effect on the number of near-native conformations. In the context of database driven exhaustive enumeration our method performs extremely well, yielding significant percentages of conformations (between 0.02% and 82%) within 6 A of the native structure.

While such \"natural moves\" may spoil the stereochemistry and even break the bonded chain at multiple locations, our new method restores the correct chain geometry by adjusting bond and torsion angles in an arbitrary defined molten zone. This is done by successive stages of partial closure that propagate the location of the chain break backwards along the chain. At the end of these stages, the size of the chain break is generally reduced so much that it can be repaired by adjusting the position of a single atom. Our chain closure method is efficient with a computational complexity of O(N(d)), where N(d) is the number of degrees of freedom used to repair the chain break. The new method facilitates the use of arbitrary degrees of freedom including the \"natural\" degrees of freedom inferred from analyzing experimental (X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR]) structures of nucleic acids and proteins. In terms of its ability to generate large conformational moves and its effectiveness in locating low energy states, the new method is robust and computationally efficient.",

After tests on artificial data from lysozyme, we applied the method to the Methonococcus maripaludis chaperonin.

We also used Natural Moves to iteratively refine against heterogeneous projection images of Methonococcus maripaludis chaperonin in a mix of open and closed states.

In this paper we present a global map of the protein space based on our analysis.

Using the PSI-BLAST procedure we defined 4,670 clusters of related sequences in this space. Of these clusters, 1,421 are centered on a sequence of known structure. All 4,670 clusters were then compared using either a structure metric (when 3D structures are known) or a novel sequence profile metric. These scores were used to define a unified and consistent metric between all clusters. Two schemes were employed to organize these clusters in a meta-organization. The first uses a graph theory method and cluster the clusters in an hierarchical organization. This organization extends our ability to predict the structure and function of many proteins beyond what is possible with existing tools for sequence analysis. The second uses a variation on a multidimensional scaling technique to embed the clusters in a low dimensional real space. This last approach resulted in a projection of the protein space onto a 2D plane that provides us with a bird's eye view of the protein space. Based on this map we suggest a list of possible target sequences with unknown structure that are likely to adopt new, unknown folds.",

Structural data deduced from the nuclear magnetic resonance (n.m.r.) spectra compare favorably with the crystal structure in terms of the combining site amino acid composition, distances of tyrosine residues from the unpaired electron of the hapten, and residues in direct contact with the hapten. Evidence is presented that a single binding site region tyrosine residue can assume two distinct conformations on binding of DNP-diGly. The AN02 antibody is an autoantibody.

The training-free method presented here uses physical principles and state-of-the-art all-atom force fields to predict both nucleosome occupancy along genomic sequences as well as binding to known positioning sequences.

Using three examples, we studied how secondary structure confines and dictates an RNA's preferred conformations. We made use of Macromolecular Conformations by SYMbolic programming (MC-Sym) fragment assembly to generate RNA conformations constrained by secondary structure. Then, to understand the correlations between different helix placements and orientations, we robustly clustered all RNA conformations by employing unique methods to remove outliers and estimate the best number of conformational clusters. We observed that the preferred conformation (as judged by largest cluster size) for each type of RNA junction molecule tested is consistent with its biological function.

Comparison of locations with over 50 deaths shows all outbreaks have a common feature: H(t) defined as loge(X(t)/X(t-1)) decreases linearly on a log scale, where X(t) is the total number of Cases or Deaths on day, t (we use ln for loge). The downward slopes vary by about a factor of three with time constants (1/slope) of between 1 and 3 weeks; this suggests it may be possible to predict when an outbreak will end. Is it possible to go beyond this and perform early prediction of the outcome in terms of the eventual plateau number of total confirmed cases or deaths? We test this hypothesis by showing that the trajectory of cases or deaths in any outbreak can be converted into a straight line. Specifically Y(t) ≡ -ln(ln(N / X(t)), is a straight line for the correct plateau value N, which is determined by a new method, Best-Line Fitting (BLF). BLF involves a straight-line facilitation extrapolation needed for prediction; it is blindingly fast and amenable to optimization. We find that in some locations that entire trajectory can be predicted early, whereas others take longer to follow this simple functional form. Fortunately, BLF distinguishes predictions that are likely to be correct in that they show a stable plateau of total cases or death (N value). We apply BLF to locations that seem close to a stable predicted N value and then forecast the outcome at some locations that are still growing wildly.

Elastic normal modes show a diminution of two α-helices by one and two residues, as well as an extension of two β-strands by three residues each, which could instigate the conformational change. The conformational change occurs in a region that is compatible with immunological studies, and it is observed more frequently in mutant prions that are prone to conversion than in wild-type prions because of differences in their starting structures, which are amplified through normal modes.

We used data from the Human Mortality Database on 33 countries with detailed age-stratified death information on an annual basis during the period 2009-2021. The use of different time periods for reference baseline led to large variability in the absolute magnitude of the exact excess death estimates. However, the relative ranking of different countries compared to others for specific years remained largely unaltered. The relative ranking of different years for the specific country was also largely independent of baseline. Averaging across all possible analyses, distinct time patterns were discerned across different countries. Countries had declines between 2009 and 2019, but the steepness of the decline varied markedly. There were also large differences across countries on whether the COVID-19 pandemic years 2020-2021 resulted in an increase of excess deaths and by how much. Consideration of longer projected time windows resulted in substantial shrinking of the excess deaths in many, but not all countries. Multiverse analysis of excess deaths over long periods of interest can offer a more unbiased approach to understand comparative mortality trends across different countries, the range of uncertainty around estimates, and the nature of observed mortality peaks.",

The derived effective potential is then tested on decoy sets used conventionally in such studies. Using our scoring function, we achieve a high level of discrimination between correct and incorrect folds. In addition, our method is able to represent functions of arbitrary shape with fewer parameters than the usual histogram potentials of similar resolution.

        "abstract": "Several teams have been publishing global estimates of excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we examine potential flaws and underappreciated sources of uncertainty in global excess death calculations. Adjusting for changing population age structure is essential. Otherwise, excess deaths are markedly overestimated in countries with increasingly aging populations. Adjusting for changes in other high-risk indicators, such as residence in long-term facilities, may also make a difference. Death registration is highly incomplete in most countries; completeness corrections should allow for substantial uncertainty and consider that completeness may have changed during pandemic years. Excess death estimates have high sensitivity to modelling choice. Therefore different options should be considered and the full range of results should be shown for different choices of pre-pandemic reference periods and imposed models. Any post-modelling corrections in specific countries should be guided by pre-specified rules. Modelling of all-cause mortality (ACM) in countries that have ACM data and extrapolating these models to other countries is precarious; models may lack transportability. Existing global excess death estimates underestimate the overall uncertainty that is multiplicative across diverse sources of uncertainty. Informative excess death estimates require risk stratification, including age groups and ethnic/racial strata. Data to-date suggest a death deficit among children during the pandemic and marked socioeconomic differences in deaths, widening inequalities. Finally, causal explanations require great caution in disentangling SARS-CoV-2 deaths, indirect pandemic effects and effects from measures taken. We conclude that excess deaths have many uncertainties, but globally deaths from SARS-CoV-2 may be the minority of calculated excess deaths.",

        "abstract": "Lattice models of proteins have been extensively used to study protein thermodynamics, folding dynamics, and evolution. Our study considers two different hydrophobic-polar (HP) models on the 2D square lattice: the purely HP model and a model where a compactness-favoring term is added. We exhaustively enumerate all the possible structures in our models and perform the study of their corresponding folds, HP arrangements in space and shapes. The two models considered differ greatly in their numbers of structures, folds, arrangements, and shapes. Despite their differences, both lattice models have distinctive protein-like features: (1) Shapes are compact in both models, especially when a compactness-favoring energy term is added. (2) The residue composition is independent of the chain length and is very close to 50% hydrophobic in both models, as we observe in real proteins. (3) Comparative modeling works well in both models, particularly in the more compact one. The fact that our models show protein-like features suggests that lattice models incorporate the fundamental physical principles of proteins. Our study supports the use of lattice models to study questions about proteins that require exactness and extensive calculations, such as protein design and evolution, which are often too complex and computationally demanding to be addressed with more detailed models.",

Much of this rapid motion is unimportant for the slower changes that are most relevant to biological function (conformational changes, substrate binding, protein folding). The high-frequency motion makes simulations computationally expensive. More importantly, the high frequencies obscure visualization of the relevant dynamics processes. Sessions, Dauber-Osguthorpe and Osguthorpe presented a method for removing high-frequency motions from atomic co-ordinates of trajectories generated by simulation. While that study used fast Fourier methods and emphasized the use of filtering for analysis of trajectories, this communication describes a new method that makes it much easier to use frequency filtering in programs that display trajectories as a sequence of moving images. Tests of the method on systems extending from pure water to proteins and nucleic acid molecules in vacuo and in solution have demonstrated its general utility. Impressed with the power and simplicity of the new method, we wish to present it in sufficient detail to allow others to implement it themselves.",

Our goal is to define clusters of homologous protein domains, beyond those detected by sequence-based methods alone, and then to build a three-dimensional (3D) model for each of the sequences that are homologous to sequences of known 3D structure. This analysis uses both sequence and structure based metrics in the analysis of all protein sequences in a non-redundant (NR) database, comprising all major sequence databases.\nThe analysis starts from the sequences of the SCOP database domains, which have known three-dimensional structures These sequences are clustered first into families based on sequence similarity alone, without incorporating any information from the SCOP classification. Each sequence-based family is represented by a profile, and this profile is used to search the NR database, using PSI-BLAST. Since PSI-BLAST can lead to false similarities, several different indices of validity are used to control the procedure Each of the detected sequences is marked and a profile is built for the whole cluster of similar sequences. A 3D model is then built for each sequence in the cluster using an alignment made using the profile as well as the known structures of the SCOP representatives in the cluster Clusters based on SCOP domains are called type-I clusters In all we find 1421 type-I clusters with total of 168,431 sequences (44.5% of our NR database)\nAfter all members of type-I clusters have been marked, we analyze the remaining sequences. The PSI-BLAST procedure is applied repeatedly, each time with a different query, to search what is left over from the previous run. This give type-II clusters, which may overlap.\nType-I and type-II clusters are then grouped using higher level measures of similarity. Those pairs of clusters that contain the same common protein (significant overlap in membership), are marked first. The pairs of clusters are then compared using either a structure metric (when 3D structures are known) or a novel sequence profile metric, and clustered into superfamilies and “fold” families.\nThis analysis avoids the limitation of classifications that are based just on sequence comparison, and allows us to construct a 3D model for a substantial portion of the sequences in the NR database.",

Within the amino terminal half of the molecule the locations of helices predicted by a number of methods agree moderately well with the observed structure, however within the carboxyl half of the molecule the overall agreement is poor. For eleven different helix predictions, the coefficients giving the correlation between prediction and observation range from 0.14 to 0.42. The accuracy of the predictions for both beta-sheet regions and for turns are generally lower than for the helices, and in a number of instances the agreement between prediction and observation is no better than would be expected for a random selection of residues. The structural predictions for T4 phage lysozyme are much less successful than was the case for adenylate kinase (Schulz et al. (1974) Nature 250, 140-142). No one method of prediction is clearly superior to all others, and although empirical predictions based on larger numbers of known protein structure tend to be more accurate than those based on a limited sample, the improvement in accuracy is not dramatic, suggesting that the accuracy of current empirical predictive methods will not be substantially increased simply by the inclusion of more data from additional protein structure determinations.",

        "abstract": "A key goal of molecular modeling is the accurate reproduction of the true quantum mechanical potential energy of arbitrary molecular ensembles with a tractable classical approximation. The challenges are that analytical expressions found in general purpose force fields struggle to faithfully represent the intermolecular quantum potential energy surface at close distances and in strong interaction regimes; that the more accurate neural network approximations do not capture crucial physics concepts, e.g., nonadditive inductive contributions and application of electric fields; and that the ultra-accurate narrowly targeted models have difficulty generalizing to the entire chemical space. We therefore designed a hybrid wide-coverage intermolecular interaction model consisting of an analytically polarizable force field combined with a short-range neural network correction for the total intermolecular interaction energy. Here, we describe the methodology and apply the model to accurately determine the properties of water, the free energy of solvation of neutral and charged molecules, and the binding free energy of ligands to proteins. The correction is subtyped for distinct chemical species to match the underlying force field, to segment and reduce the amount of quantum training data, and to increase accuracy and computational speed. For the systems considered, the hybrid ab initio parametrized Hamiltonian reproduces the two-body dimer quantum mechanics (QM) energies to within 0.03 kcal/mol and the nonadditive many-molecule contributions to within 2%.

Evidence suggests that cell surface proteins are not as freely diffusible as implied by the classic fluid mosaic model and that their confinement to membrane domains is regulated. It is unknown whether these dynamic localization mechanisms function to enhance signal transduction activation rate or to minimize cross talk among pathways that share common intermediates. To determine which of these two possibilities is more likely, we derive an explicit equation for the rate at which cell surface membrane proteins interact based on a Brownian motion model in the presence of endocytosis and exocytosis. We find that in the absence of any diffusion constraints, cell surface protein interaction rate is extremely high relative to cytoplasmic protein interaction rate even in a large mammalian cell with a receptor abundance of a mere two hundred molecules. Since a larger number of downstream signaling events needs to take place, each occurring at a much slower rate than the initial activation via association of cell surface proteins, we conclude that the role of co-localization is most likely that of cross-talk reduction rather than coupling efficiency enhancement.",

        "abstract": "In molecular dynamics simulations of protein unfolding, the pathway of one protein molecule is studied at a time. In contrast, experimental denaturation studies sample from large ensembles of molecules passing from the native to unfolded state. If reasonable comparisons with experiment are to be made, then the generality of the simulations needs to be confirmed by performing multiple unfolding simulations. Given that protein unfolding trajectories are very complicated functions of the proteins and the environment, comparing different trajectories, even under the same conditions, is not straightforward. Several methods are presented here that attempt to accomplish this task at different levels of complexity. The simpler methods are geometry based and make use of the root-mean-squared deviations between structures, while the more complicated methods are based on the time variation of the various properties of the system during the unfolding process. These methods are applied to multiple simulations of three different proteins, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, chymotrypsin inhibitor 2, and barnase. In general, for these three proteins protein unfolding proceeded via expansion of the core and fraying of secondary structure to yield the major transition state. Once past the transition state, the trajectories for a given protein diverged as the protein lost further secondary and tertiary structure by a variety of mechanisms. Although the unfolding pathways diverged, similar conformations were populated in the denatured state even when the unfolding occurred via different pathways. The multitude of different pathways leading to the denatured state agrees with the funnel description of protein folding. Although the pathways differed in conformational space, the physical properties of the conformations were often similar, highlighting the danger of assuming that similar observed properties imply similar conformations. In fact, there may be many different \"conformational pathways\" of unfolding that fit within a preferred \"property space pathway\".",

The standard solution to this problem is to limit the studies to non-redundant subsets of the PDB. While alleviating biases, this solution hides the many-to-many relations between sequences and structures. That is, non-redundant datasets conceal the diversity of sequences that share the same fold and the existence of multiple conformations for the same protein. A particularly disturbing aspect of non-redundant subsets is that they hardly benefit from the rapid pace of protein structure determination, as most newly solved structures fall within existing families.",

The derived effective potential is then tested on decoy sets used conventionally in such studies. Using our scoring function, we achieve a high level of discrimination between correct and incorrect folds. In addition, our method is able to represent functions of arbitrary shape with fewer parameters than the usual histogram potentials of similar resolution. Finally, our representation can be combined easily with many optimization methods, because the total energy is a linear function of the parameters.

The HX protection factors computed from the relative O-state populations agree well with experiment. The O states of different amides show little or no temporal correlation, even if adjacent residues unfold cooperatively. The mean residence time of the O state is ∼100 ps for all examined amides, so the large variation in measured HX rate must be attributed to the opening frequency. A few amides gain solvent access via tunnels or pores penetrated by water chains including native internal water molecules, but most amides access solvent by more local structural distortions. In either case, we argue that an overcoordinated N-H group is necessary for efficient proton transfer by Grotthuss-type structural diffusion.",

Countries were divided into less and more vulnerable; the latter had per capita nominal GDP < $30,000, Gini > 0.35 for income inequality and/or at least ≥2.5% of their population living in poverty. Excess deaths (as proportion of expected deaths, p%) were inversely correlated with per capita GDP (r = -0.60), correlated with proportion living in poverty (r = 0.66), and modestly correlated with income inequality (r = 0.45). Incidence rate ratio for deaths was 1.062 (95% CI, 1.038-1.087) in more versus less vulnerable countries. Excess deaths started deviating in the two groups after the first wave.

About 80% of these sequences contain at least one region recognized by the conserved domain architecture retrieval tool (CDART) as a sequence motif. Motifs provide clues to biological function but CDART often matches the same region of a protein by two or more profiles. Such synonyms complicate estimates of functional complexity. We do full-linkage clustering of redundant profiles by finding maximum disjoint cliques: Each cluster is replaced by a single representative profile to give what we term a unique function word (UFW). From 2009 to 2016, the number of sequence profiles used by CDART increased by 80%; the number of UFWs increased more slowly by 30%, indicating that the number of UFWs may be saturating. The number of sequences matched by a single UFW (sequences with single domain architectures) increased as slowly as the number of different words, whereas the number of sequences matched by a combination of two or more UFWs in sequences with multiple domain architectures (MDAs) increased at the same rate as the total number of sequences. This combinatorial arrangement of a limited number of UFWs in MDAs accounts for the genomic diversity of protein sequences. Although eukaryotes and prokaryotes use very similar sets of \"words\" or UFWs (57% shared), the \"sentences\" (MDAs) are different (1.3% shared).",

To properly function, RNA molecules usually have to fold to specific structures, and therefore understanding RNA structure is vital in comprehending how RNA functions. One approach to understanding and predicting biomolecular structure is to use knowledge-based potentials built from experimentally determined structures. These types of potentials have been shown to be effective for predicting both protein and RNA structures, but their utility is limited by their significantly rugged nature. This ruggedness (and hence the potential's usefulness) depends heavily on the choice of bin width to sort structural information (e.g. distances) but the appropriate bin width is not known a priori. To circumvent the binning problem, we compared knowledge-based potentials built from inter-atomic distances in RNA structures using different mixture models (Kernel Density Estimation, Expectation Minimization and Dirichlet Process). We show that the smooth knowledge-based potential built from Dirichlet process is successful in selecting native-like RNA models from different sets of structural decoys with comparable efficacy to a potential developed by spline-fitting - a commonly taken approach - to binned distance histograms. The less rugged nature of our potential suggests its applicability in diverse types of structural modeling.",

MOTIF-EM takes cryoEM volumetric maps as inputs. The technique used by MOTIF-EM to detect conserved sub-structures is inspired by a recent breakthrough in 2D object recognition. The technique works by constructing rotationally invariant, low-dimensional representations of local regions in the input cryoEM maps. Correspondences are established between the reduced representations (by comparing them using a simple metric) across the input maps. The correspondences are clustered using hash tables and graph theory is used to retrieve conserved structural domains or motifs. MOTIF-EM has been used to extract conserved domains occurring in large macromolecular assembly maps, including as those of viruses P22 and epsilon 15, Ribosome 70S, GroEL, that remain structurally conserved in different functional states.

We have assessed the structural basis of this approach, by evaluating the accuracy of our 1991 model of a three-site mutant of lambda repressor (V36L/M40L/V47I), against the recently reported crystal structure. The three mutated residues matched the crystal structure to within 0.89A (1.11A for sidechain atoms), giving fairly accurate sidechain placement and packing (81-99th percentile rank in coordinate accuracy). However, the model used different sidechain torsional angles than seen in the crystal structure at residues 36 and 40, apparently to compensate for the backbone shifts present in the actual mutant structure, but not accounted for in our modeling method. To understand the structural basis of stability across a set of lambda repressor core mutants, we have analyzed the mutant models, revealing several simple packing effects: V36I, predicted to be stabilized by filling a hydrophobic cavity; M40V, destabilized by a steric clash with the unusual structural demands of a helix-turn transition. These effects illustrate how mutant stability can often be understood directly from scrutiny of wildtype structure. Simply adding the calculated energies of neighboring point mutations predicts the stability effect of the combined mutant relatively well, with little apparent cooperativity, yielding simple rules for each site's amino acid preferences. Our treatment of core packing indicates that it can permit a large fraction of sequences to fit the native fold, as observed experimentally, far more than indicated by rotamer hard-sphere models.",

A better understanding of the conformational rearrangements at the epitope might be very helpful for the development of a good vaccine. Cholera toxin (CT) as well as the closely related heat‐labile toxin from Escherichia coli (LT) are composed of two subunits, A and B, which form an oligomeric assembly AB5. Residues 50–64 on the surface of the B subunits comprise a conserved loop (CTP3), which is involved in saccharide binding to the receptor on epithelial cells. This loop exhibits remarkable conformational plasticity induced by environmental constraints. The crystal structure of this loop is compared in the free and receptor‐bound toxins as well as in the crystal and solution structures of a complex with TE33, a monoclonal antibody elicited against CTP3. In the toxins this loop forms an irregular structure connecting a β‐strand to the central α‐helix. Ser 55 and Gin 56 exhibit considerable conformational variability in the five subunits of the unliganded toxins. Saccharide binding induces a change primarily in Ser 55 and Gin 56 to a conformation identical in all five copies. Thus, saccharide binding confers rigidity upon the loop. The conformation of CTP3 in complex with TE33 is quite different. The amino‐terminal part of CTP3 forms a β‐turn that fits snugly into a deep binding pocket on TE33, in both the crystal and NMR‐derived solution structure. Only 8 and 12 residues out of 15 are seen in the NMR and crystal structures, respectively. Despite these conformational differences, TE33 is cross‐reactive with intact CT, albeit with a thousandfold decrease in affinity. This suggests a different interaction of TE33 with intact CT.",

        "abstract": "igand binding free-energy calculations using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged as a powerful tool for in silico drug design. Here, we present results obtained with the ARROW force field (FF)—a multipolar polarizable and physics-based model with all parameters fitted entirely to high-level ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) calculations. ARROW has already proven its ability to determine solvation free energy of arbitrary neutral compounds with unprecedented accuracy. The ARROW FF parameterization is now extended to include coverage of all amino acids including charged groups, allowing molecular simulations of a series of protein–ligand systems and prediction of their relative binding free energies. We ensure adequate sampling by applying a novel technique that is based on coupling the Hamiltonian Replica exchange (HREX) with a conformation reservoir generated via potential softening and nonequilibrium MD. ARROW provides predictions with near chemical accuracy (mean absolute error of ∼0.5 kcal/mol) for two of the three protein systems studied here (MCL1 and Thrombin). The third protein system (CDK2) reveals the difficulty in accurately describing dimer interaction energies involving polar and charged species. Overall, for all of the three protein systems studied here, ARROW FF predicts relative binding free energies of ligands with a similar accuracy level as leading nonpolarizable force fields.",

        "abstract": "TRiC is an important group II chaperonin that facilitates the folding of many eukaryotic proteins. The TRiC complex consists of two stacked rings, each comprised of eight paralogous subunits with a mutual sequence identity of 30-35%. Each subunit has unique functional roles that are manifested by corresponding sequence conservation. It is generally assumed that the subunit order within each ring is fixed, but this order is still uncertain. Here we address the problem of the intra-ring subunit order by combining two sources of information: evolutionary conservation and a structural hypothesis. Specifically, we identify residues in the TRiC subunits that are likely to be part of the intra-unit interface, based on homology modeling to the solved thermosome structure. Within this set of residues, we search for a subset that shows an evolutionary conservation pattern that is indicative of the subunit order key. This pattern shows considerable conservation across species, but large variation across the eight subunits. By this approach we were able to locate two parts of the interface where complementary interactions seem to favor certain pairing of subunits. This knowledge leads to restrictions on the 5,040 (=7!) possible subunits arrangements in the ring, and limits them to just 72. Although our findings give only partial understanding of the inter-subunit interactions that determine their order, we conclude that they are comprised of complementary charged, polar and hydrophobic interactions that occur in both the equatorial and middle domains of each subunit.",

The structure prediction method was rigourously tested by making blind predictions at the third meeting on the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure methods (CASP3). The method is a combined hierarchical approach involving exhaustive enumeration of all possible folds of a small protein sequence on a tetrahedral lattice. A set of filters, primarily in the form of discriminatory functions, are applied to these conformations. As the filters are applied, greater detail is added to the models resulting in a handful of all-atom \"final\" conformations. Encouraged by the results at CASP3, we used our approach to help solve a practical biological problem: the prediction of the structure and function of the 67-residue C-terminal zinc-finger region of the DNA polymerase alpha-associated zinc-finger (PAZ) protein. We discuss how the prediction points to a novel function relative to the sequence homologs, in conjunction with evidence from experiment, and how the predicted structure is guiding further experimental studies.

Widely used molecular mechanics (MM) forcefields obtain parameters from experimental data and quantum chemistry calculations on small molecules but do not have a clear way to take advantage of the information in high-resolution macromolecular structures. In contrast, knowledge-based methods largely ignore the physical chemistry of interatomic interactions, and instead derive parameters almost exclusively from macromolecular structures. This can involve considerable double counting of the same physical interactions. Here, we describe a method for forcefield improvement that combines the strengths of the two approaches. We use this method to improve the Rosetta all-atom forcefield, in which the total energy is expressed as the sum of terms representing different physical interactions as in MM forcefields and the parameters are tuned to reproduce the properties of macromolecular structures. To resolve inaccuracies resulting from possible double counting of interactions, we compare distribution functions from low-energy modeled structures to those from crystal structures. The structural and physical bases of the deviations between the modeled and reference structures are identified and used to guide forcefield improvements. We describe improvements resolving double counting between backbone hydrogen bond interactions and Lennard-Jones interactions in helices; between sidechain-backbone hydrogen bonds and the backbone torsion potential; and between the sidechain torsion potential and Lennard-Jones interactions. Discrepancies between computed and observed distributions are also used to guide the incorporation of an explicit Cα-hydrogen bond in β sheets. The method can be used generally to integrate different sources of information for forcefield improvement.",

The structure was determined starting with a molecular replacement (MR) model identified by unsupervised refinement of a pool of 50 candidate MR models. This initial model had 2.8-Å RMSD from the solution. The solved structure was validated by comparison with a model subsequently derived from an alternative crystal form diffracting to higher resolution.

Due to errors stemming from poorly interpretable parts of the electron density map, human experience and intuition are imperative for building a correct atomistic model. For this reason, tools for automatic structure determination used nowadays require constant human supervision. Here we present a method that can overcome the difficulties; it greatly reduces or even eliminates human involvement in the solution process by working with ensembles of possible solutions. This approach can find solution of a higher quality than can humans and can solve difficult cases not amenable to other methods. We present a method for automatic solution of protein crystal structures. The method proceeds with a single initial model obtained, for instance, by molecular replacement (MR). If a good-quality search model is not available, as often is the case with MR of distant homologs, our method first can automatically screen a large pool of poorly placed models and single out promising candidates for further processing if there are any.

In the present study, we have investigated the 3D hydration structure of the protein BPTI (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor) by molecular dynamics (MD) and the integral equation method in the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) approach. Both methods have found a well-defined hydration layer around the protein and revealed the localization of BPTI buried water molecules corresponding to the X-ray crystallography data. Moreover, under 3D-RISM calculations, the obtained positions of waters bound firmly to the BPTI sites are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results mentioned above for the BPTI crystal form. The analysis of the 3D hydration structure (thickness of hydration shell and hydration numbers) was performed for the entire protein and its polar and non-polar parts using various cut-off distances taken from the literature as well as by a straightforward procedure proposed here for determining the thickness of the hydration layer. Using the thickness of the hydration shell from this procedure allows for calculating the total hydration number of biomolecules properly under both methods. Following this approach, we have obtained the thickness of the BPTI hydration layer of 3.6 Å with 369 water molecules in the case of MD simulation and 3.9 Å with 333 water molecules in the case of the 3D-RISM approach. The above procedure was also applied for a more detailed description of the BPTI hydration structure near the polar charged and uncharged radicals as well as non-polar radicals.

Among the various methods to calculate protein-ligand binding affinities, alchemical free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations performed by way of explicitly solvated molecular dynamics simulations (FEP/MD) provide a thermodynamically rigorous and complete description of the binding event and should in turn yield highly accurate predictions. Although the original theory of FEP was proposed more than 60 years ago, subsequent applications of FEP to compute protein-ligand binding free energies in the context of drug discovery projects over much of that time period was sporadic and generally unsuccessful. This was mainly due to the limited accuracy of the available force fields, inadequate sampling of the protein-ligand conformational space, complexity of simulation set up and analysis, and the large computational resources required to pursue such calculations. Over the past few years, there have been advances in computing power, classical force field accuracy, enhanced sampling algorithms, and simulation setup. This has led to newer FEP implementations such as the FEP+ technology developed by Schrödinger Inc., which has enabled accurate and reliable calculations of protein-ligand binding free energies and positioned free energy calculations to play a guiding role in small-molecule drug discovery. In this chapter, we outline the methodological advances in FEP+, including the OPLS3 force fields, the REST2 (Replica Exchange with Solute Tempering) enhanced sampling, the incorporation of REST2 sampling with conventional FEP (Free Energy Perturbation) through FEP/REST, and the advanced simulation setup and data analysis. The validation of FEP+ method in retrospective studies and the prospective applications in drug discovery projects are also discussed. We then present the recent extension of FEP+ method to handle challenging perturbations, including core-hopping transformations, macrocycle modifications, and reversible covalent inhibitor optimization. The limitations and pitfalls of the current FEP+ methodology and the best practices in real applications are also examined.",

Many consensus statements use panels of experts to deduce perceived consensus through Delphi processes. We argue that stacking of panel members toward one particular position or narrative is a major threat, especially in absence of systematic evidence review. Stacking may involve financial conflicts of interest, but nonfinancial conflicts of strong advocacy can also cause major bias. Given their emerging importance, we describe here how such consensus statements may be misleading, by analyzing in depth a recent high-impact Delphi consensus statement on COVID-19 recommendations as a case example. We demonstrate that many of the selected panel members and at least 35% of the core panel members had advocated toward COVID-19 elimination (Zero-COVID) during the pandemic and were leading members of aggressive advocacy groups. These advocacy conflicts were not declared in the Delphi consensus publication, with rare exceptions. Therefore, we propose that consensus statements should always require rigorous evidence synthesis and maximal transparency on potential biases toward advocacy or lobbyist groups to be valid. While advocacy can have many important functions, its biased impact on consensus panels should be carefully avoided.",

This lack of dependence on region size leads us to hypothesize that virus spread depends on the universal properties of the network of social interactions. We test this hypothesis by simulating the propagation of a virus on networks of different topologies or connectivities. Our main finding is that we can reproduce the Gompertz growth observed for many early outbreaks with a simple virus spread model on a scale-free network, in which nodes with many more neighbors than average are common. Nodes that have very many neighbors are infected early in the outbreak and then spread the infection very rapidly. When these nodes are no longer infectious, the remaining nodes that have most neighbors take over and continue to spread the infection. In this way, the rate of spread is fastest at the very start and slows down immediately. Geometrically we see that the \"surface\" of the epidemic, the number of susceptible nodes in contact with the infected nodes, starts to rapidly decrease very early in the epidemic and as soon as the larger nodes have been infected. In our simulation, the speed and impact of an outbreak depend on three parameters: the average number of contacts each node makes, the probability of being infected by a neighbor, and the probability of recovery. Intelligent interventions to reduce the impact of future outbreaks need to focus on these critical parameters in order to minimize economic and social collateral damage.",

The first model is the trace of the Cα-atoms along the protein main chain, and the second is their projections onto the protein axis. The resulting trajectories are subsequently analyzed using the theory of the generalized Langevin equation. Velocities are replaced by displacements relating consecutive points on the discrete protein axes and equilibrium ensemble averages by averages over appropriate protein structure ensembles. The resulting displacement autocorrelation functions resemble those of the velocity autocorrelation functions of simple liquids and display a minimum, which can be related to the lengths of secondary structure elements. This minimum is clearly more pronounced for well-structured proteins than for unstructured ones, and the corresponding memory function displays a slower decay, indicating a stronger \"folding memory.\"",

In our simulation, the speed and impact of an outbreak depend on three parameters: the average number of contacts each node makes, the probability of being infected by a neighbor, and the probability of recovery. Intelligent interventions to reduce the impact of future outbreaks need to focus on these critical parameters in order to minimize economic and social collateral damage.",

Continuum dielectric models often work well in describing the thermodynamic aspects of aqueous solvation and can be very efficient compared to the explicit treatment of the solvent. Here, we review a particular class of so-called fast implicit solvent models, generalized Born (GB) models, which are widely used for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins and nucleic acids. These approaches model hydration effects and provide solvent-dependent forces with efficiencies comparable to molecular-mechanics calculations on the solute alone; as such, they can be incorporated into MD or other conformational searching strategies in a straightforward manner. The foundations of the GB model are reviewed, followed by examples of newer, emerging models and examples of important applications. We discuss their strengths and weaknesses, both for fidelity to the underlying continuum model and for the ability to replace explicit consideration of solvent molecules in macromolecular simulations.",

For articles in physics it compares two methods of allocating credit, the standard (whole) counting system and the fractional counting system. Although numerous studies have found that when the whole counting system is used, more highly coauthoring researchers are more productive and publish more highly cited articles, no study has established whether this is true when the fractional counting system is used. This is particularly important as findings on coauthorship can be used to support the recent encouragement of co-authorship by research policy. This study finds: (a) when whole counting is used, the productivity and citation level increases with level of co-authorship; but (b) when fractional counting is used, the productivity and citation level decreases with level of co-authorship. This casts doubt on the received wisdom about the advantage of co-authored research.",

Despite this progress, a general deep-learning framework for protein design that enables solution of a wide range of design challenges, including de novo binder design and design of higher-order symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion models10,11 have had considerable success in image and language generative modelling but limited success when applied to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry and sequence-structure relationships. Here we show that by fine-tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the design of diverse functional proteins from simple molecular specifications.",

In this work, molecular dynamics simulations have been performed on the A-DNA with sequence of CCCGGCCGGG, to elucidate the influence of ionic valence and temperature on the structural stability of A-DNA in salt solution. The results show that the structure of A-DNA is more stable in AlCl3 solution compared with MgCl2 and NaCl solution. To further discuss the influence of ionic valency, two kinds of virtual ions (monovalent X+ and trivalent Z3+) are created based on the properties of magnesium ions. From the simulations, the stability of A-DNA structure is better in high valent cationic salt solution. This has something to do with electrostatic interaction between metal ions and DNA chains. The electrostatic interaction force is gradually improved with the increasing of ionic valency, which is conducive to the formation of more compact DNA structure. Also, in the condition of same concentration and ionc valency, low temperature has a contribution to the stability of A-DNA structure.",

Here we report the structure of an archaeal group II chaperonin in its prehydrolysis ATP-bound state at subnanometer resolution using single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Structural comparison of Mm-cpn in ATP-free, ATP-bound, and ATP-hydrolysis states reveals that ATP binding alone causes the chaperonin to close slightly with a ∼45° counterclockwise rotation of the apical domain. The subsequent ATP hydrolysis drives each subunit to rock toward the folding chamber and to close the lid completely. These motions are attributable to the local interactions of specific active site residues with the nucleotide, the tight couplings between the apical and intermediate domains within the subunit, and the aligned interactions between two subunits across the rings. This mechanism of structural changes in response to ATP is entirely different from those found in group I chaperonins.",

        "abstract": "Molecular dynamics studies have demonstrated that molecular water at an interface, with either a gas or a solid, displays anisotropic orientational behavior in contrast to its bulk counterpart. This effect has been recently implicated in the like-charge attraction problem for colloidal particles in solution. Here, negatively charged particles in solution display a long-ranged attraction where continuum electrostatic theory predicts monotonically repulsive interactions, particularly in solutions with monovalent salt ions at low ionic strength. Anisotropic orientational behavior of solvent molecules at an interface gives rise to an excess interfacial electrical potential which we suggest generates an additional solvation contribution to the total free energy that is traditionally overlooked in continuum descriptions of interparticle interactions in solution. In the present investigation we perform molecular dynamics simulation based calculations of the interfacial potential using realistic surface models representing various chemistries as well as different solvents. Similar to previous work that focused on simple model surfaces constructed by using oxygen atoms, we find that solvents at more realistic model surfaces exhibit substantial anisotropic orientational behavior. We explore the dependence of the interfacial solvation potential on surface properties such as surface group chemistry and group density at silica and carboxylated polystyrene interfaces. For water, we note surprisingly good agreement between results obtained for a simple O-atom wall and more complex surface models, suggesting a general qualitative consistency of the interfacial solvation effect for surfaces in contact with water. In contrast, for an aprotic solvent such as DMSO, surface chemistry appears to exert a stronger influence on the sign and magnitude of the interfacial solvation potential. The study carries broad implications for molecular-scale interactions and may find relevance in explaining a range of phenomena in soft-matter physics and cell biology.",

This statistical description has been developed using tools from the statistical mechanics of disordered systems, polymers, and phase transitions of finite systems. We review here its analytical background and contrast the phenomena in homopolymers, random heteropolymers, and protein-like heteropolymers that are kinetically and thermodynamically capable of folding. The connection between these statistical concepts and the results of minimalist models used in computer simulations is discussed.

To do this, we characterize a large fraction of the currently known protein sequences ( approximately 140,000) in structural terms, by matching them to known structures via sequence comparison (or by secondary-structure class prediction for those without structural homologues). Overall, we find that an appreciable fraction of the known folds are present in each of the major groups of organisms (e.g., bacteria and eukaryotes share 156 of 275 folds), and most of the common folds are associated with many families of nonhomologous sequences (i.e., >10 sequence families for each common fold). However, different groups of organisms have characteristically distinct distributions of folds. So, for instance, some of the most common folds in vertebrates, such as globins or zinc fingers, are rare or absent in bacteria. Many of these differences in fold usage are biologically reasonable, such as the folds of metabolic enzymes being common in bacteria and those associated with extracellular transport and communication being common in animals. They also have important implications for database-based methods for fold recognition, suggesting that an unknown sequence from a plant is more likely to have a certain fold (e.g., a TIM barrel) than an unknown sequence from an animal.",

The recognition of this lesion by OGG1 is a complex process that involves scanning the DNA for the presence of 8-oxoG, followed by recognition and lesion removal. Structural data have shown that OGG1 evolves through different stages of conformation onto the DNA, corresponding to elementary steps of the 8-oxoG recognition and extrusion from the double helix. Single-molecule studies of OGG1 on naked DNA have shown that OGG1 slides in persistent contact with the DNA, displaying different binding states probably corresponding to the different conformation stages. However, in cells, the DNA is not naked and OGG1 has to navigate into a complex and highly crowded environment within the nucleus. To ensure rapid detection of 8-oxoG, OGG1 alternates between 3D diffusion and sliding along the DNA. This process is regulated by the local chromatin state but also by protein co-factors that could facilitate the detection of oxidized lesions. We will review here the different methods that have been used over the last years to better understand how OGG1 detects and process 8-oxoG lesions.",

The ET's irregular and chemically complex wall allows for various NC-ET interactions.

We employed FPA and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate how individual residues placed in a glycine-serine repeat segment within an AP-stalled NC interact with the ET to exert a pulling force on the AP and release stalling. Our results indicate that large and hydrophobic residues generate a pulling force on the NC when placed ≳10 residues away from the peptidyl transfer center (PTC). Moreover, an asparagine placed 12 residues from the PTC makes a specific stabilizing interaction with the tip of ribosomal protein uL22 that reduces the pulling force on the NC, while a lysine or leucine residue in the same position increases the pulling force. Finally, the MD simulations suggest how the Mannheimia succiniproducens SecM AP interacts with the ET to promote translational stalling.",

The resulting improved model phases provide better starting points for automated model building and produce more significant difference peaks in anomalous difference Fourier maps to locate anomalous scatterers than does standard refinement.

The measurements are made using a newly implemented geometric construction: the arrangement of circles on a sphere. This construction allows the definition of residue covering areas which are used as parameters to build functions able to distinguish native structures from decoys. These functions, encoding up to 5-body contacts are evaluated on a reference set of 66 structures and its 45000 decoys, and also on the often used lattice ssfit set from the decoys'R us database.

Notably, actin induces a conformational change in PhLP2A, causing its N-terminal helices to extend across the inter-ring interface to directly contact a hydrophobic groove in actin.

Yet, recent studies have begun to focus on the evolutionary insights that can be derived from sub-domain-scale themes, which are candidates for traces of more ancient events. Characterizing these may provide clues to the emergence of domains. Particularly interesting are themes that are reused across dissimilar contexts, that is, where the rest of the protein domain differs.

        "abstract": "Just as Freud used stages of psychosexual development to ground his model of psychoanalysis, it is possible to do the same with Erik Erikson's stages of development with regards to a model of psychodynamic psychotherapy. This paper proposes an eight-stage model of psychodynamic psychotherapy linked to Erik Erikson's eight stages of psychosocial development. Various suggestions are offered. One such suggestion is that as each of Erikson's developmental stages is triggered by a crisis, in therapy it is triggered by the client's search. The resolution of the search often leads to the development of another search, which implies that the therapy process comprises a series of searches. This idea of a series of searches and resolutions leads to the understanding that identity is developmental and therapy is a space in which a new sense of identity may emerge. The notion of hope is linked to Erikson's stage of Basic Trust and the proposed model of therapy views hope and trust as essential for the therapy process. Two clinical vignettes are offered to illustrate these ideas.",

In addition, we assign coordinates to all atoms for four of the 25 proteins and show that this has a small effect on the number of near-native conformations. In the context of database driven exhaustive enumeration our method performs extremely well, yielding significant percentages of conformations (between 0.02% and 82%) within 6 A of the native structure.

The 108M and 108V variants are reported to differ in their thermal stability, with 108M COMT losing catalytic activity more rapidly. Because human s-COMT contains seven cysteine residues and includes CXXC and CXXS motifs that are associated with thiol-disulfide redox reactions, we examined the effects of reducing and oxidizing conditions on the enzyme. In the absence of a reductant 108M s-COMT lost activity more rapidly than 108V, whereas in the presence of 4 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) we found no significant differences in the stability of the two variants at 37 degrees C. DTT also restored most of the activity that was lost upon incubation at 37 degrees C in the absence of DTT. Mass spectrometry showed that cysteines 188 and 191 formed an intramolecular disulfide bond when s-COMT was incubated with oxidized glutathione, whereas cysteines 69, 95, 157, and 173 formed protein-glutathione adducts. Replacing Cys-95 by serine protected 108M s-COMT against inactivation in the absence of a reductant; C33S and Cys-188 mutations had little effect, and C69S was destabilizing. The sequences surrounding the reactive cysteine residues of human s-COMT and other proteins that form glutathione adducts at identified sites all include Pro and/or Gly and most include a hydrogen-bonding residue, suggesting that glutathiolation at conserved sites plays a physiologically important role.",

Materiał i metody: W badaniu wykorzystano 18 samców szczura. Zwierzęta podzielono na trzy grupy: 1 - grupa kontrolna, 2 - grupa MSG, 3 - grupa MSG + Z56822977. Szczurzym oseskom w grupie 2 i 3 podawano podskórnie MSG rozpuszczony w soli fizjologicznej w dawce 4 mg/g masy ciała w objętości 8 μl/g w 2., 4., 6., 8. i 10. dniu życia. Grupie 3 podawano doustnie wodny roztwór Z56822977 w dawce 25 mg/kg w objętości 1 ml/kg. Pierwszą dawkę Z56822977 podawano po ukończeniu 4 tygodni życia, a następnie kontynuowa-no podawanie badanej substancji cyklicznie wedlug schematu tydzień podawania substancji badanej/3 tygodnie przerwy. Zwierzętom z grupy MSG podawano odpowiednio 1 ml/kg wody doustnie. Przez pierwsze 4 miesiące życia szczury otrzymywały standardową karmę. Zmierzono zawartość serotoniny, tryptofanu i 5-hydroksytryptofanu (5-HTr) oraz aktywność hydroksylazy tryptofanowej (tryptophan hydroxylase, TRH), dekarboksylazy aminokwasów (amino acid decarboxylase, AADC) i monoaminooksydazy (MAO) w tkance mózgowej. WYNIKI: Wykazano, że podawanie Z56822977 ma pozytywny wpływ na główne wskaźniki otyłości, co odzwierciedlają zmiany podsta-wowych parametrów fizjologicznych i biochemicznych [zmniejszenie masy ciała o 13% vs. MSG (p < 0,05); zmniejszenie wskaźnika masy ciała (body mass index, BMI), wskaźnika Lee oraz masy tkanki tłuszczowej trzewnej odpowiednio o 18%, 7% i 55%, (p < 0,05) w porównaniu z grupą MSG]. Zawartość tryptofanu i serotoniny była istotnie niższa (p < 0,05) u szczurów z otyłością wywołaną przez MSG. W badaniach wykazano, że u otyłych szczurów aktywność MAO zwiększa się o 97% (p < 0,05), a aktywność TRH i AADC odpowiednio o 44% i 53% (p < 0,05). Podawanie Z56822977 powodowało zwiększenie zawartości serotoniny i tryptofanu w mózgach szczurów i przywracało poziom aktywności enzymów (MAO, TRH, AADC) do wartości mierzonych u zwierząt kontrolnych. WNIOSKI: Wiadomo, że otyłość wiąże się z zaburzeniem syntezy serotoniny w mózgu szczurów. Jednak podawanie Z56822977 prowadzi do normalizacji stężenia serotoniny i tryptofanu oraz przywrócenia prawidłowej aktywności enzymów uczestniczących w biosynte-zie i degradacji serotoniny. Podawanie Z56822977, cząsteczki wpływającej na układ serotoninergiczny, może powodować korzystne efekty w leczeniu otyłości wywołanej przez MSG u szczurów. Można rozważać zastosowanie cząsteczki Z56822977 jako nowego leku stosowanego w otyłości, jednak konieczne są dalsze badania w celu potwierdzenia jej działania.",

        "abstract": "Misfolding and aggregation of prion proteins are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of the misfolding process is of enormous interest in the scientific community. It has been speculated and widely discussed that the native cellular prion protein (PrPC) form needs to undergo substantial unfolding to a more stable PrPC* state, which may further oligomerize into the toxic scrapie (PrPSc) form. Here, we have studied the mechanism of the unfolding of the human prion protein (huPrP) using a set of extensive well-tempered metadynamics simulations. Through multiple microsecond-long metadynamics simulations, we find several possible unfolding pathways. We show that each pathway leads to an unfolded state of lower free energy than the native state. Thus, our study may point to the signature of a PrPC* form that corresponds to a global minimum on the conformational free-energy landscape. Moreover, we find that these global minima states do not involve an increased β-sheet content, as was assumed to be a signature of PrPSc formation in previous simulation studies. We have further analyzed the origin of metastability of the PrPC form through free-energy surfaces of the chopped helical segments to show that the helices, particularly H2 and H3 of the prion protein, have the tendency to form either a random coil or a β-structure. Therefore, the secondary structural elements of the prion protein are only weakly stabilized by tertiary contacts and solvation forces so that relatively weak perturbations induced by temperature, pressure, pH, and so forth can lead to substantial unfolding with characteristics of intrinsically disordered proteins.",

The four derivatives, N alpha-MNA-Arg1-N epsilon-DA-coum-Lysn-BPTI [(1-n)BPTI] (n = 15, 26, 41, and 46), were purified by affinity chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The homogeneity of each derivative and its site of labeling were characterized by HPLC tryptic peptide mapping. Nonradiative energy transfer from MNA (donor) to DA-coum (acceptor) was measured by monitoring donor emission and acceptor excitation spectra. Transfer efficiencies between 45% and 85% were observed. The fluorescence decay of MNA in MNA-BPTI, a derivative labeled by a donor without an acceptor, is monoexponential, with a lifetime of 6.8 +/- 0.15 ns. The decay kinetics of MNA fluorescence measured for derivatives labeled both by donor and acceptor showed a small deviation from monoexponential decay with shorter average lifetimes. Analysis of the experimental decay curves yielded the detailed intramolecular distance distribution functions for each pair of labeled sites. The averages of the calculated distance distribution functions are close to the values expected from the known structure of BPTI in the crystalline state. The derivatives thus obtained are suitable for investigation of conformational transitions of the labeled protein and for monitoring localized changes such as those involved in the folding or unfolding transitions.",

        "abstract": "Today we can use physics to describe in great detail many of the phenomena intervening in the process of life. But no analogous unified description exists for the phenomenon of life itself. In spite of their complexity, all living creatures are out of equilibrium chemical systems sharing four fundamental properties: they (1) handle information, (2) metabolize, (3) self-reproduce and (4) evolve. This small number of features, which in terran life are implemented with biochemistry, point to an underlying simplicity that can be taken as a guide to motivate and implement a theoretical physics style unified description of life using tools from the non-equilibrium physical-chemistry of extended systems. Representing a system with general rules is a well stablished approach to model building and unification in physics, and we do this here to provide an abstract mathematical description of life. We start by reviewing the work of previous authors showing how the properties in the above list can be individually represented with stochastic reaction-diffusion kinetics using polynomial reaction terms. These include \"switches\" and computation, the kinetic representation of autocatalysis, Turing instability and adaptation in the presence of both deterministic and stochastic environments. Thinking of these properties as existing on a space-time lattice each of whose nodes are subject to a common mass-action kinetics compatible with the above, leads to a very rich dynamical system which, just as natural life, unifies the above properties and can therefore be interpreted as a high level or \"outside-in\" theoretical physics representation of life. Taking advantage of currently available advanced computational techniques and hardware, we compute the phase plane for this dynamical system both in the deterministic and stochastic cases. We do simulations and show numerically how the system works. We review how to extract useful information that can be mapped into emergent physical phenomena and attributes of importance in life such as the presence of a \"membrane\" or the time evolution of an individual system's negentropy or mass. Once these are available, we illustrate how to perform some basic phenomenology based on the model's numerical predictions. Applying the above to the idealization of the general Cell Division Cycle (CDC) given almost 25 years ago by Hunt and Murray, we show from the numerical simulations how this system executes a form of the idealized CDC. We also briefly discuss various simulations that show how other properties of living systems such as migration towards more favorable regions or the emergence of effective Lotka-Volterra populations are accounted for by this general and unified view from the \"top\" of the physics of life. The paper ends with some discussion, conclusions, and comments on some selected directions for future research. The mathematical techniques and powerful simulation tools we use are all well established and presented in a \"didactical\" style. We include a very rich but concise SI where the numerical details are thoroughly discussed in a way that anyone interested in studying or extending the results would be able to do so.",

To initiate photodissociation, trajectories of the liganded molecule were interrupted, the iron-carbon monoxide bond was broken, and the parameters of the iron-nitrogen bonds were simultaneously altered to produce a deoxyheme conformation. Heme potential functions were used that reproduce the energies and forces for the iron out-of-plane motion obtained from quantum mechanical calculations. The effect of the protein on the rate and extent of the displacement of the iron from the porphyrin plane was assessed by comparing the results with those obtained for an isolated complex of heme with imidazole and carbon monoxide. The half-time for the displacement of the iron from the porphyrin plane was found to be 50-150 fs for both the protein and the isolated complex. These results support the interpretation of optical absorption studies using 250-fs laser pulses that the iron is displaced from the porphyrin plane within 350 fs in both hemoglobin and a free heme complex in solution.",

It is becoming increasingly evident that \"connector regions\" are important components of the dynamic personality of protein structures. These regions may be either disordered loops, i.e., poorly structured regions connecting secondary structural elements, or linkers that connect entire protein domains. Experimental and computational studies have, however, revealed that these regions are not mere connectors, and their role in allostery and conformational changes has been emerging in the last few decades. Here we provide a detailed overview of the structural properties and classification of loops and linkers, as well as a discussion of the main computational methods employed to investigate their function and dynamical properties.

This ruggedness (and hence the potential's usefulness) depends heavily on the choice of bin width to sort structural information (e.g. distances) but the appropriate bin width is not known a priori. To circumvent the binning problem, we compared knowledge-based potentials built from inter-atomic distances in RNA structures using different mixture models (Kernel Density Estimation, Expectation Minimization and Dirichlet Process). We show that the smooth knowledge-based potential built from Dirichlet process is successful in selecting native-like RNA models from different sets of structural decoys with comparable efficacy to a potential developed by spline-fitting - a commonly taken approach - to binned distance histograms. The less rugged nature of our potential suggests its applicability in diverse types of structural modeling.",

        "abstract": "Continuing improvements in analytical technology along with an increased interest in performing comprehensive, quantitative metabolic profiling, is leading to increased interest pressures within the metabolomics community to develop centralized metabolite reference resources for certain clinically important biofluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid, urine and blood. As part of an ongoing effort to systematically characterize the human metabolome through the Human Metabolome Project, we have undertaken the task of characterizing the human serum metabolome. In doing so, we have combined targeted and non-targeted NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS methods with computer-aided literature mining to identify and quantify a comprehensive, if not absolutely complete, set of metabolites commonly detected and quantified (with today's technology) in the human serum metabolome. Our use of multiple metabolomics platforms and technologies allowed us to substantially enhance the level of metabolome coverage while critically assessing the relative strengths and weaknesses of these platforms or technologies. Tables containing the complete set of 4229 confirmed and highly probable human serum compounds, their concentrations, related literature references and links to their known disease associations are freely available at http://www.serummetabolome.ca.",

        "abstract": "A new computational procedure which simultaneously provides gap closure and side-chain positioning in homology modelling is described. It uses a database search scheme to generate fragments to model gaps, a rotamer library to define side-chain conformations, and iteratively refines a conformational matrix CM, such that its elements CM(i,j,o) and CM(i,j,k) give the probabilities that the backbone of residue i adopts the conformation described by fragment j and that its side-chain adopts the conformation of its possible rotamer k. Each residue experiences the average of all possible environments, weighted by their respective probabilities. The method converges, thereby deserving the name of 'self consistent mean field' approach.",

        "abstract": "Viral infection compromises specific organelles of the cell and readdresses its functional resources to satisfy the needs of the invading body. Around 70% of the coronavirus positive-sense single-stranded RNA encodes proteins involved in replication, and these viruses essentially take over the biosynthetic and transport mechanisms to ensure the efficient replication of their genome and trafficking of their virions. Some coronaviruses encode genes for ion-channel proteins - the envelope protein E (orf4a), orf3a and orf8 - which they successfully employ to take control of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex intermediate compartment or ERGIC. The E protein, which is one of the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, assembles its transmembrane protomers into homopentameric channels with mild cationic selectivity. Orf3a forms homodimers and homotetramers. Both carry a PDZ-binding domain, lending them the versatility to interact with more than 400 target proteins in infected host cells. Orf8 is a very short 29-amino-acid single-passage transmembrane peptide that forms cation-selective channels when assembled in lipid bilayers. This review addresses the contribution of biophysical and structural biology approaches that unravel different facets of coronavirus ion channels, their effects on the cellular machinery of infected cells and some structure-functional correlations with ion channels of higher organisms.",

Here, we compare the ability of common implicit solvent models (TC, OBC, OBC2, GBMV, GBMV2, GBSW, GBSW/MS, GBSW/MS2 and FACTS) to reproduce experimental absolute hydration free energies for a series of 499 small neutral molecules that are modeled using AMBER/GAFF parameters and AM1-BCC charges. Given optimized surface tension coefficients for scaling the surface area term in the nonpolar contribution, most implicit solvent models demonstrate reasonable agreement with extensive explicit solvent simulations (average difference 1.0-1.7 kcal/mol and R(2)=0.81-0.91) and with experimental hydration free energies (average unsigned errors=1.1-1.4 kcal/mol and R(2)=0.66-0.81). Chemical classes of compounds are identified that need further optimization of their ligand force field parameters and others that require improvement in the physical parameters of the implicit solvent models themselves. More sophisticated nonpolar models are also likely necessary to more effectively represent the underlying physics of solvation and take the quality of hydration free energies estimated from implicit solvent models to the next level.",

The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.",

Common HER2 mutants yielded differential sensitivities to eleven EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in vitro, and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that mutants with a reduced drug-binding pocket volume were associated with decreased affinity for larger TKIs. Overall, poziotinib was the most potent HER2 mutant-selective TKI tested. Phase II clinical testing in ERBB2 exon 20-mutant non-small cell lung cancer resulted in a confirmed objective response rate of 42% in the first 12 evaluable patients. In pre-clinical models, poziotinib upregulated HER2 cell-surface expression and potentiated the activity of T-DM1, resulting in complete tumor regression with combination treatment.",

        "abstract": "Proteins are molecular machines whose function depends on their ability to achieve complex folds with precisely defined structural and dynamic properties. The rational design of proteins from first-principles, or de novo, was once considered to be impossible, but today proteins with a variety of folds and functions have been realized. We review the evolution of the field from its earliest days, placing particular emphasis on how this endeavor has illuminated our understanding of the principles underlying the folding and function of natural proteins, and is informing the design of macromolecules with unprecedented structures and properties. An initial set of milestones in de novo protein design focused on the construction of sequences that folded in water and membranes to adopt folded conformations. The first proteins were designed from first-principles using very simple physical models. As computers became more powerful, the use of the rotamer approximation allowed one to discover amino acid sequences that stabilize the desired fold. As the crystallographic database of protein structures expanded in subsequent years, it became possible to construct proteins by assembling short backbone fragments that frequently recur in Nature. The second set of milestones in de novo design involves the discovery of complex functions. Proteins have been designed to bind a variety of metals, porphyrins, and other cofactors. The design of proteins that catalyze hydrolysis and oxygen-dependent reactions has progressed significantly. However, de novo design of catalysts for energetically demanding reactions, or even proteins that bind with high affinity and specificity to highly functionalized complex polar molecules remains an importnant challenge that is now being achieved. Finally, the protein design contributed significantly to our understanding of membrane protein folding and transport of ions across membranes. The area of membrane protein design, or more generally of biomimetic polymers that function in mixed or non-aqueous environments, is now becoming increasingly possible.",

Remarkably large loop insertions are tolerated and many redesigns have generated proteins that successfully fold to stable, active structures. Some redesigns have been entirely the choice of the investigators, whereas others have incorporated a randomization and selection step to identify optimal sequences. These studies have provided basic guidelines for the rational manipulation of protein structure and stability, they have allowed the dissection of folding pathways and they have generated proteins with the potential for practical therapeutic applications.",

Molecular fingerprints encode properties of small molecules and assess their similarities computationally through bit string comparisons. Based on the similarity to a biologically active template, molecular fingerprint methods allow for identifying additional compounds with a higher chance of displaying similar biological activities against the same target - a process commonly referred to as virtual screening (VS).",

We were interested in gender representation in chemistry through the lens of scientific publishing. Publications are a central academic currency and are critical for funding, recruiting, and promotion in academia. Here we report the results of an analysis that compared the percentage of female first and last authors across 10 chemistry, 3 chemical biology, and 3 general journals from 2005 to 2020. We show that women are substantially underrepresented in chemistry authorship even when compared with their relative populations in academia and are not predicted to achieve parity within the next 50 years at the current rate in any journal. Our findings highlight the need for changes to the publishing process to achieve a more equitable publishing environment.",

        "abstract": "Amazingly little sequence variation is reported for the kringle IV 2 copy number variation (KIV 2 CNV) in the human LPA gene. Apart from whole genome sequencing projects, this region has only been analyzed in some detail in samples of European populations. We have performed a systematic resequencing study of the exonic and flanking intron regions within the KIV 2 CNV in 90 alleles from Asian, European, and four different African populations. Alleles have been separated according to their CNV length by pulsed field gel electrophoresis prior to unbiased specific PCR amplification of the target regions. These amplicons covered all KIV 2 copies of an individual allele simultaneously. In addition, cloned amplicons from genomic DNA of an African individual were sequenced. Our data suggest that sequence variation in this genomic region may be higher than previously appreciated. Detection probability of variants appeared to depend on the KIV 2 copy number of the analyzed DNA and on the proportion of copies carrying the variant. Asians had a high frequency of so-called KIV 2 type B and type C (together 70% of alleles), which differ by three or two synonymous substitutions respectively from the reference type A. This is most likely explained by the strong bottleneck suggested to have occurred when modern humans migrated to East Asia. A higher frequency of variable sites was detected in the Africans. In particular, two previously unreported splice site variants were found. One was associated with non-detectable Lp(a). The other was observed at high population frequencies (10% to 40%). Like the KIV 2 type B and C variants, this latter variant was also found in a high proportion of KIV 2 repeats in the affected alleles and in alleles differing in copy numbers. Our findings may have implications for the interpretation of SNP analyses in other repetitive loci of the human genome.",
