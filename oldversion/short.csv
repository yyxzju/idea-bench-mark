The recent characterization of the refolding of a number of simple, single domain proteins has provided a means of testing these assertions. Our investigations have revealed statistically significant correlations between the average sequence separation between contacting residues in the native state and the rate and transition state placement of folding for a non-homologous set of simple, single domain proteins. These indicate that proteins featuring primarily sequence-local contacts tend to fold more rapidly and exhibit less compact folding transition states than those characterized by more non-local interactions. No significant relationship is apparent between protein length and folding rates, but a weak correlation is observed between length and the fraction of solvent-exposed surface area buried in the transition state. Anticipated strong relationships between equilibrium folding free energy and folding kinetics, or between chemical denaturant and temperature dependence-derived measures of transition state placement, are not apparent. The observed correlations are consistent with a model of protein folding in which the size and stability of the polypeptide segments organized in the transition state are largely independent of protein length, but are related to the topological complexity of the native state.

The absence of a consensus sequence that defines functional cysteines in proteins has hindered their discovery and characterization. Here we describe a proteomics method to profile quantitatively the intrinsic reactivity of cysteine residues en masse directly in native biological systems. Hyper-reactivity was a rare feature among cysteines and it was found to specify a wide range of activities, including nucleophilic and reductive catalysis and sites of oxidative modification. Hyper-reactive cysteines were identified in several proteins of uncharacterized function, including a residue conserved across eukaryotic phylogeny that we show is required for yeast viability and is involved in iron-sulphur protein biogenesis. We also demonstrate that quantitative reactivity profiling can form the basis for screening and functional assignment of cysteines in computationally designed proteins, where it discriminated catalytically active from inactive cysteine hydrolase designs.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aa9a74eb811e350ac7605fdeeaadaa49855748ca,"It is demonstrated that quantitative reactivity profiling can form the basis for screening and functional assignment of cysteines in computationally designed proteins, where it discriminated catalytically active from inactive cysteine hydrolase designs.",E.

Here we describe the computational design of eight enzymes that use two different catalytic motifs to catalyse the Kemp elimination-a model reaction for proton transfer from carbon-with measured rate enhancements of up to 10(5) and multiple turnovers. Mutational analysis confirms that catalysis depends on the computationally designed active sites, and a high-resolution crystal structure suggests that the designs have close to atomic accuracy. Application of in vitro evolution to enhance the computational designs produced a >200-fold increase in k(cat)/K(m) (k(cat)/K(m) of 2,600 M(-1)s(-1) and k(cat)/k(uncat) of >10(6)).

The LEE-SERVER, which makes extensive use of conformational space annealing to create alignments, to help Modeller build physically realistic models while satisfying input restraints from templates and CHARMM stereochemistry, and to remodel the side-chains. ROSETTA, whose high resolution refinement protocol combines a physically realistic all atom force field with Monte Carlo minimization to allow the large conformational space to be sampled quickly.

To solve this problem, semantic Web rough ontology should be introduced as a feasible solution. Semantic Web rough ontology which is a knowledge base is an extension of semantic Web ontology to support the semantic Web practical operation. Essentially, it is the core of the ontology based application systems and needs to be invoked frequently. For this reason, an appropriate method must be adopted to store the semantic Web rough ontology in order to guarantee enough ontology access efficiency. Based on the definition and the model of the semantic Web rough ontology, and considering that relational database is one of the most common storage media, a semantic Web rough ontology storage method based on relational database is proposed. Furthermore, a storage mode is designed and discussed deeply. Based on the designed storage mode, a constructed semantic Web rough ontology can be easily stored into a relational database. Through a practical examination, the tested and verified result reveals that not only the model mentioned above is rational but also the storage method proposed is valid and feasible in practice.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/60e5f9d8dc481adbd62641e95880d944e450497a,"A semantic Web rough ontology storage method based on relational database is proposed, which reveals that not only the model mentioned above is rational but also the storage method proposed is valid and feasible in practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
